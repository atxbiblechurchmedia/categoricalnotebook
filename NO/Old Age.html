<h2><a name="_Old_Age"></a>Old Age</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Word of God gives old age promise, vitality, hope,
and strength. The book of Titus provides some characteristics of old age from
divine viewpoint. These characteristics accrue from a first-hand knowledge of
Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Bible is filled with believers who were greatly used
of the Lord in old age. Before the Flood, men like Enoch lived to 365 years of
age. Methuselah was 969 years of age and died the year of the Flood. After the Flood,
Noah lived 950 years, Abraham 175, Isaac 180, Jacob 147, Joseph 110, Moses 120,
Caleb over 85, Daniel over 90, Paul 65-87, Peter 55-67, and John over 90.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scientists say that the secret of a long, healthy life
lies in having long-lived parents, a healthy environment, and a philosophy that
produce peace of mind, a sense of humor, and the skill of adaptation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We often talk about the new believer, the growing
believer, and the mature believer. The Word of God talks a lot about ages,
mostly of men, although a few women’s ages are revealed. Although there are
various divisions regarding growth patterns and age in the human race, the biblical
pattern seems to be 0-40 years old is referred to as youth, 40-60 years old is
referred to as middle age, and over 60 years old is referred to as old age.
Today, there are various terms used to describe old age such as; senior citizens,
seniors, elderly, mature, aged, old-timers, geriatric, and other less generous
terms. The most wonderful people I have ever met are older believers. Unfortunately,
the most miserable people I have ever met are also older believers. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Youth is up to 40 years of age and is preparation. For
example, Moses began to sense his responsibility to Israel at 40 years of age
according to Acts 7:23. However, he had to get 40 more years of training before
God could use him. It was during the last 40 years of his life that he led the
children of Israel out of Egypt.</p>

<p class=Verses>““But when he was approaching the age of forty, it entered his
mind to visit his brethren, the sons of Israel.”  (Acts 7:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 4:22, a man was healed that was older than 40
years and the unbelieving Sanhedrin wanted to ridicule his testimony. In 1
Timothy 4:12, Paul admonished Timothy who was in his 30’s at the time. From
this verse, we can deduce that full maturity was not reached until 40 in many
cases and one was considered in youth before that time. Youth, but not
necessarily immaturity.</p>

<p class=Verses>“for the man was more than forty years old on whom this miracle
of healing had been performed.”  (Acts 4:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Let no one look down on your youthfulness, but rather in
speech, conduct, love, faith and purity, show yourself an example of those who
believe.”  (1 Timothy 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Middle age in the Bible was considered from 40 to 60
years of age. It was a time for spiritual production on the front lines of the
Angelic Conflict. 1 Timothy 5:9 talks about a 60-year old widow. Her retirement
would consist of a full time prayer ministry. She would be supported by the
local church. Many believers hit their top pace and spiritual production
between 40 and 60. Some before. </p>

<p class=Verses>“A widow is to be put on the list only if she is not less than
sixty years old, having been the wife of one man,”  (1 Timothy 5:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The high priests had a heavy work load between 30 and 50
years of age. Jesus Christ began His public ministry at 30 years of age. Also,
Jesus Christ as a priest, had already fulfilled the Mosaic Law at age 30. As
the son of David, our Lord began His public ministry at the same age as King
David began his reign. Num. 4; Luke 3:23; 2 Sam. 5:4. </p>

<p class=Verses>“When He began His ministry, Jesus Himself was about thirty
years of age, being, as was supposed, the son of Joseph, the son of Eli,” 
(Luke 3:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“David was thirty years old when he became king, and he reigned
forty years.”  (2 Samuel 5:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Old Age in the Bible is considered 60 years old and older
and is a time of prayer behind the scenes. Before the Flood, the average
lifespan was very long. Adam lived 930 years, Methuselah lived 969 years, and
so on. After the Flood, Noah lived 350 years, 950 years in all. Abraham lived
175 years, Isaac lived 180 years, Jacob 147 years, and Joseph 110 years. From
then, on the maximum age was approximately 120 years. In Luke 2:35-38 there was
a woman “advanced in years” (84 years old) having been married only seven years
as a young lady. She was very active in serving the Lord.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and a sword will pierce even your own soul—to the end that
thoughts from many hearts may be revealed.” And there was a prophetess, Anna
the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was advanced in years and
had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage, and then as a widow
to the age of eighty-four. She never left the temple, serving night and day
with fastings and prayers. At that very moment she came up and began giving
thanks to God, and continued to speak of Him to all those who were looking for
the redemption of Jerusalem.”  (Luke 2:35-38, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Old Age is a Mental Attitude </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Old age is only a mental attitude. It is not lack of age
that hinders, it is lack of maturity. Young people feel those that are 30 years
old are old. Those that are 30 don’t feel old, but 50 may seem old to them.
Those that are 50 may feel those that are 70 are old. At 70, many may feel they
are not old. Some may feel old even when they are 50. So what is old age?</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>People tend to shudder when you mention old age. Next to
death, it is not a favorite topic. There are many ways people try to postpone
old age. Products are marketed everywhere that claim to keep you young.
Traveling can occupy your time and keep you from feeling old. Gadgets are
everywhere that claim to postpone old age. And somehow, all the exciting things
in life such as happiness and gaiety seem to be connected with youth. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>The older one becomes as a
believer, the better life should become. </span>Whether your spiritual life
begins at 40, 50 or 60, it can be a very wonderful life because God’s plan is
bigger than any problem this life can produce! Provided of course, that you
understand salvation and have received it as a free gift, where God did all the
work. Provided that you are getting Bible teaching served daily. Isaiah 28:10; 1
Tim. 5:9; Luke 2:36-38. </p>

<p class=Verses>““For He says, ‘Order on order, order on order, Line on line,
line on line, A little here, a little there.’““  (Isaiah 28:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“A widow is to be put on the list only if she is not less than
sixty years old, having been the wife of one man,” (1 Timothy 5:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And there was a prophetess, Anna the daughter of Phanuel, of
the tribe of Asher. She was advanced in years and had lived with her husband
seven years after her marriage, and then as a widow to the age of eighty-four.
She never left the temple, serving night and day with fastings and prayers. At
that very moment she came up and began giving thanks to God, and continued to
speak of Him to all those who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.”
(Luke 2:36-38, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some of the most miserable and obnoxious believers around
are in old age. Old age arrives exposing faults, habits, and obnoxious
characteristics. Old age can be horrible if the believer is constantly out of
fellowship, in reversionism, receiving divine discipline, producing their own
self-induced misery, or even finding themselves under the sin unto death if
this continues for a long time.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For these people, the weather upsets them. Their
neighbors upset them. Their loved ones upset them. The horrible world upsets
them. Youth upsets them. High prices upset them. Yet they are alive and here
for a purpose of which they are unaware. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The older one becomes as a believer, the better life
should become. Old age is last because it is best. You should now have
spiritual maturity with a completed or nearly completed edification complex of
the soul. You should now have only a few years until your promotion into glory.
Happiness in old age is often dependent upon remembering your Creator in the
days of your youth. Eccl. 12:1. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth, before
the evil days come and the years draw near when you will say, &quot;I have no
delight in them&quot;;” (Ecclesiastes 12:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Description of Old Age</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A 20-fold description of old age can be found in Ecclesiastes
12:3-7. It is a very tough list to understand and deal with. This description was
written about 1,000 years before Christ was born or about 3,000 years ago. See
if this fairly intensive picture of what is encountered in old age tallies with
old age in the 21st Century. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ecclesiastes 12:3, “in the day that the watchmen of
the house tremble” refers to the arms of the body being shaky and trembling. “The
house” refers to the body. The arms groom the body and feed it, etc. “Mighty
men stoop” refers to those who were very strong in youth and middle age are now
stooped and their legs and back are unable to support the weight of the body. “The
grinding ones stand idle because they are few” refers to lack of teeth. There
were no false teeth or crowns or implants in those days. “Those that look through
windows dim” refers to the eyes that have become blind with poor vision,
cataracts, etc. They have become blind. They had no corrective glasses or
contacts in those days. </p>

<p class=Verses>“in the day that the watchmen of the house tremble, and mighty
men stoop, the grinding ones stand idle because they are few, and those who
look through windows grow dim;” (Ecclesiastes 12:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ecclesiastes 12:4, “the doors are shut” refers to the
mouth and the ears losing their ability to speak and hear. “The sound of the
grinding mill is low” refers to the sound of gums chewing rather than teeth. “One
will arise at the sound of a bird” refers to insomnia. “The daughters of song
will sing softly” means he has a reduced ability to hear. </p>

<p class=Verses>“and the doors on the street are shut as the sound of the
grinding mill is low, and one will arise at the sound of the bird, and all the
daughters of song will sing softly.” (Ecclesiastes 12:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ecclesiastes 12:5, “men are afraid of a high place”
refers to high altitude that bothers older people, and the concern for falling
down. They dislike going up stairs, escalators, and they get dizzy at times
standing on the edge of a cliff. “Terrors on the road” means they become very
uncertain of themselves, fear the loss of health, fear of loss of a job, and
they are uncertain about what they will do after retirement. “The almond tree
blossoms” means that once they had a beautiful head of hair, but the hair has
fallen out like almonds fall off a tree, which refers to baldness. “The
grasshopper drags himself along” refers to inability to carry something heavy.
This refers to handling and carrying anything of some weight is a burden to
carry, they are in a weakened physical condition, they have a bad back. “The
caperberry is ineffective” is a reference to the berries of the caper plant
used <span style='background:white'>as excitants of sexual desire. This phrase
refers to t</span>he appetites and passions subsiding. They will have little
initiative and they may one day want to die. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Furthermore, men are afraid of a high place and of terrors on
the road; the almond tree blossoms, the grasshopper drags himself along, and
the caperberry is ineffective. For man goes to his eternal home while mourners
go about in the street.” (Ecclesiastes 12:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ecclesiastes 12:6, “before the silver cord is broken”
refers the deterioration of the spinal cord that causes loss of faculties
resulting ultimately in death. It also refers to other nervous and respiratory
system problems. “The golden bowl is crushed” speaks of an injury to the head
caused by falling, or milder problems such as headaches, and the inability to
concentrate. “The pitcher by the well is shattered” refers to the heart failing
to function properly and the effects of reduced circulation of blood. “The
wheel at the cistern is crushed” refers to lung problems with shortness of
breath, panting, and not enough residual air to properly function. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Remember Him before the silver cord is broken and the golden
bowl is crushed, the pitcher by the well is shattered and the wheel at the
cistern is crushed;” (Ecclesiastes 12:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ecclesiastes 12:7, “then the dust will return to the
earth as it was” refers to the body decomposing and returning to the earth after
death. “The spirit will return to God who gave it” refers to physical death. </p>

<p class=Verses>“then the dust will return to the earth as it was, and the
spirit will return to God who gave it.” (Ecclesiastes 12:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Now that is a picture of old age. A very thorough one.
Did anything sound familiar? </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Solomon’s Advice for Young People</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ecclesiastes 11:9, Solomon has reached old age and he
had some advice for young people. The youth should begin immediately to have a
happy old age. Happiness isn’t in retirement. Happiness isn’t working.
Happiness isn’t this diversion or that. True happiness is spiritual growth,
production of the fruit of the Spirit, no scar tissue and a healthy edification
complex of the soul.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Rejoice, young man, during your childhood, and let your heart
be pleasant during the days of young manhood. And follow the impulses of your
heart and the desires of your eyes. Yet know that God will bring you to
judgment for all these things.”  (Ecclesiastes 11:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Find happiness when you are young. For believers, the
only inner mental happiness is found through the Word. Carry your happiness
around with you. If you rejoice when you are young, you are going to have a
marvelous old age. Learn the Word.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If you carry around inner happiness in your youth, old
age will never bother you. No matter how tough it is, it will never bother you
that you are past 30, past 40, past 50, past 60, and past 70. People fight old
age. Don’t fight it. Really, old age is the best of all. Actually, people in
old age are the salt of the earth, the aristocrats of Christianity. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ecclesiastes 11:9, “Follow the impulses of your heart
and the desires of your eyes” means to walk in Bible doctrine and apply Bible
doctrine to experience and grow spiritually. “Yet know” means you have to know
it before you do it. “God will bring you to judgment for all these things”
means that if you are walking with the Lord, there will still be divine
discipline. </p>

<p class=Verses>“So, remove grief and anger from your heart and put away pain
from your body, because childhood and the prime of life are fleeting.” 
(Ecclesiastes 11:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ecclesiastes 11:10, “remove grief and anger from your
heart” means to remove jealousy, moodiness, fear, and pettiness. “Put away pain
from your body” means the believer is to confess their sins to God the Father
and claim God’s promises and gain spiritual understanding while in fellowship.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Childhood and youth can be vanity and emptiness. Think
over your childhood and some of the things you did. So you were captain of the
football team. So you were the beauty queen. So you were very popular. Does
this sustain you now, through sufferings, through trials?</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If someone wrote in your school annual, “To the greatest
guy in the world” did that sustain you? When was the last time that things
written in your school annual sustained you while under life’s pressures?
Never. However, God’s Word will carry you and is the only thing that is capable
of carrying you.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is the basis of old age. You are likely saying, “You
know, I’m getting old because certain attributes of old age are showing up. My
hair is getting thin on top, the wrinkles are beginning to show up, and the
joints are beginning to creak when I walk.” There is always hope in old age.
Where there is life, there is hope. Eccl. 9:4-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For whoever is joined with all the living, there is hope;
surely a live dog is better than a dead lion. For the living know they will
die; but the dead do not know anything, nor have they any longer a reward, for
their memory is forgotten. Indeed their love, their hate and their zeal have
already perished, and they will no longer have a share in all that is done
under the sun.”  (Ecclesiastes 9:4-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Answer to Old Age</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Coming into old age as an unbeliever, you may have been a
hard worker and lived comfortably. You may have been kind and helpful, a good
neighbor. You may have been a stable and dependable person, but all is for
naught if you have never believed in Jesus Christ, receiving Him as your personal
Savior. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Coming into old age as a mature believer, you have
functioned under the filling of the Holy Spirit, and you have functioned under
the grace apparatus for perception. You, therefore, have a completed or nearly
completed edification complex of the soul and you have spent minimum time under
emotional revolt.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ecclesiastes 12:9 describes coming into old age as a
knowledgeable believer assured of your redemption. You understand not only
salvation, but spirituality. You understand how to claim promises. You
understand why believers suffer. You understand that God’s plan is bigger than
anything that can be thrown your way in the devil’s world. In other words, you
have stockpiled <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the right lobe of your soul
and have applied it to life’s experiences and problems. </p>

<p class=Verses>“In addition to being a wise man, the Preacher also taught the
people knowledge; and he pondered, searched out and arranged many proverbs.” 
(Ecclesiastes 12:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ecclesiastes 12:10-11 describes coming into old age able
to apply the Word of God to experience causing old age stability. Coming into
old age, realize that there are many books, but only one book, the Bible, that is
the mind of Christ. Eccl. 12:12; 1 Cor. 2:16. </p>

<p class=Verses>“The Preacher sought to find delightful words and to write
words of truth correctly. The words of wise men are like goads, and masters of
these collections are like well-driven nails; they are given by one Shepherd.” 
(Ecclesiastes 12:10-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But beyond this, my son, be warned: the writing of many books
is endless, and excessive devotion to books is wearying to the body.” 
(Ecclesiastes 12:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT
HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.”  (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Coming into old age, utilize the faith-rest life and
occupation with Christ as you always have. Eccl. 12:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The conclusion, when all has been heard, is: fear God and keep
His commandments, because this applies to every person.”  (Ecclesiastes 12:13,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>With old age, the body may get weaker and weaker, but
eternity with our Lord in a perfect resurrection body awaits. 2 Cor. 4:15-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For all things are for your sakes, so that the grace which is
spreading to more and more people may cause the giving of thanks to abound to
the glory of God. Therefore we do not lose heart, but though our outer man is
decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day. For momentary, light
affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all
comparison,”  (2 Corinthians 4:15-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>What Leads to Living a Long Life?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Accounts of very old people can be found in newspapers
and magazines. Many relate their longevity to genetics, some to work habits,
some to their environment, etc. Many are contradictory with most subjective and
anecdotal. So, what does the Bible say about why some live long lives and
others do not? The Bible gives some basic reasons for long life on the earth. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Long life begins with a respect for the authority of
parents. While in youth, this respect for your parent’s authority leads to a
respect for the other authorities of life, the policeman on the corner, the
judge on the bench, the common law of the land, respect for property of others,
privacy of others, etc. Exodus 20:12; Prov. 30:11; Matt. 15:4; Eph. 5:1-4. Proverbs
30:17 is a reference to violent premature death from one who mocks and scorns
their parents.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be
prolonged in the land which the LORD your God gives you.”  (Exodus 20:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“There is a kind of man who curses his father And does not
bless his mother.”  (Proverbs 30:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“ “For God said, ‘HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER,’ and, ‘HE WHO
SPEAKS EVIL OF FATHER OR MOTHER IS TO BE PUT TO DEATH.’ “  (Matthew 15:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children; and walk
in love, just as Christ also loved you and gave Himself up for us, an offering
and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma. But immorality or any impurity or
greed must not even be named among you, as is proper among saints; and there
must be no filthiness and silly talk, or coarse jesting, which are not fitting,
but rather giving of thanks.”  (Ephesians 5:1-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The eye that mocks a father And scorns a mother, The ravens of
the valley will pick it out, And the young eagles will eat it.”  (Proverbs
30:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Parents who can command your respect leads to longevity. Exodus
20:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be
prolonged in the land which the LORD your God gives you.”  (Exodus 20:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Long life is sometimes dependent upon a strong physical
body, sometimes not. Psalms 90:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“As for the days of our life, they contain seventy years, Or if
due to strength, eighty years, Yet their pride is but labor and sorrow; For
soon it is gone and we fly away.”  (Psalms 90:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Long life comes from a maximum working knowledge of the
Word of God, as in Moses’ case.  This kept Moses’ physical vitality strong and his
mind keen. Deut. 34:5-12; Deut. 34:10; Deut. 34:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of
Moab, according to the word of the LORD. And He buried him in the valley in the
land of Moab, opposite Beth-peor; but no man knows his burial place to this
day. Although Moses was one hundred and twenty years old when he died, his eye
was not dim, nor his vigor abated. So the sons of Israel wept for Moses in the
plains of Moab thirty days; then the days of weeping and mourning for Moses
came to an end. Now Joshua the son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom,
for Moses had laid his hands on him; and the sons of Israel listened to him and
did as the LORD had commanded Moses. Since that time no prophet has risen in
Israel like Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face, for all the signs and
wonders which the LORD sent him to perform in the land of Egypt against
Pharaoh, all his servants, and all his land, and for all the mighty power and
for all the great terror which Moses performed in the sight of all Israel.” 
(Deuteronomy 34:5-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Since that time no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses,
whom the LORD knew face to face,”  (Deuteronomy 34:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Although Moses was one hundred and twenty years old when he
died, his eye was not dim, nor his vigor abated.”  (Deuteronomy 34:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Essence of Old Age</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Let’s look at the characteristics of old age from the
spiritual standpoint in 1 Timothy 5:5. “Alone” is <span lang=EL>μονο</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (monoō) in the Greek and means alone, desolate. An
occupational hazard of being a widow is loneliness. The answer to this is
two-fold – trust in God and continual prayer. Trust in God and His plan for
your life involves using faith-rest, claiming His promises, and being occupied
with Christ. It also includes a consistent prayer life. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Now she who is a widow indeed and who has been left alone, has
fixed her hope on God and continues in entreaties and prayers night and day.” 
(1 Timothy 5:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 Timothy 5:10 refers to a widow. “Has shown hospitality
to strangers” refers to believers from other areas, missionaries, pastors, and
other Christians. “Washed the saints’ feet” means she provided the necessary
equipment to clean up as an expression of hospitality. “Has assisted those in
distress” refers to nursing, day care, visitation, and knows the needs of the
community. She is characterized by “walking in the Spirit” and producing divine
good. Because of her walk with the Lord, she can master these details. Dorcas
in Acts 9:36 is another good example.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“having a reputation for good works; and if she has brought up
children, if she has shown hospitality to strangers, if she has washed the
saints’ feet, if she has assisted those in distress, and if she has devoted
herself to every good work.”  (1 Timothy 5:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now in Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha (which
translated in Greek is called Dorcas); this woman was abounding with deeds of
kindness and charity which she continually did.”  (Acts 9:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Characteristics of Older Men</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Titus 2:2, “Temperate” is <span lang=EL>νηφα</span>́<span
lang=EL>λεος</span> (nēphaleos) means in the use of wine in moderation, to not
be drunk. “Dignified” is <span lang=EL>σεμνο</span>́<span lang=EL>ς</span>
(semnos) in the Greek and is a word of character. It means to be honorable, to
have Christ’s character produced in you, or spiritual maturity. Your life is
characterized by your production of divine good. You have a character of love
instead of hatred, joy instead of unhappiness and irritability, inner peace
instead of restlessness and bitterness, patience instead of impatience,
gentleness instead of being a bull in the proverbial china shop, goodness
instead of orneriness and being cruel, faith instead of faithlessness, humility
instead of pride, and self-control instead of undisciplined living. Gal.
5:22-23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Older men are to be temperate, dignified, sensible, sound in
faith, in love, in perseverance.”  (Titus 2:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience,
kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things
there is no law.”  (Galatians 5:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Titus 2:2, “Sensible” is <span lang=EL>σω</span>́<span
lang=EL>φρων</span> (sōphrōn) in the Greek and means to save the mind, to be healthy
minded, alert, and sharp. How can the Bible save the mind? In any age, mental
attitude sins can destroy the mind. These things can make a fool out of anyone.
It makes people react. They get mad, pout, and try to run around and convince
others why they are right. Mental attitude sins can result such as bitterness,
gossip, hostility, jealousy, revenge, vindictiveness, etc. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>These put scar tissue on the soul? What is scar tissue?
It is a blinded, darkened mind in Ephesians 4:18. It is a hardened mind in Hebrews
3:13. It is a conscience seared with a hot iron in 1 Timothy 4:2. This plugs up
the mind and stops clear thinking.</p>

<p class=Verses>“being darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life
of God because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of
their heart;”  (Ephesians 4:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But encourage one another day after day, as long as it is
still called “Today,” so that none of you will be hardened by the deceitfulness
of sin.”  (Hebrews 3:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“by means of the hypocrisy of liars seared in their own
conscience as with a branding iron,”  (1 Timothy 4:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sins of the tongue can destroy the mind of a believer.
Maybe some believer has crossed you or a loved one. So, you run them down. This
is bad in youth, but with old age, it is pitiful. Sins of the tongue include
gossip, maligning, backbiting, and destructive criticism. Save your mind by growing
spiritually by the renewing of your mind. Rom. 12:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by
the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that
which is good and acceptable and perfect.”  (Romans 12:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Titus 2:2, “sound in faith” means healthy doctrinally,
a thinker of divine viewpoint, spiritually mature. This is knowing how to stay
in fellowship, knowing how to claim God’s promises and when, and knowing how to
live in the Word. This means to not only understand salvation, but knowing how
the new man has impact for Christ via a completed edification complex of the
soul. The spiritually mature believer understands what the Bible says is sin,
mental attitude sin, sins of the tongue, and overt sins. They must know how and
when and why to apply all these doctrines in the spiritual life.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Older men are to be temperate, dignified, sensible, sound in
faith, in love, in perseverance.”  (Titus 2:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“In love” refers to mental attitude love and the absence
of mental attitude sins. such as bitterness, gossip, hostility, jealousy, revenge,
vindictiveness, etc. “Perseverance” means steadfastness and is the
characteristic of a man who is not swerved from his deliberate purpose and his
loyalty to faith and piety by even the greatest trials and sufferings. It means
remaining in fellowship under pressure. It’s a pity to see believers along in
years and still chewing on each other, nagging each other, running each other
down, and letting a little inconvenience or error make a believer lose their
cool.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Temperate, dignified, sensible, sound in faith, in love,
in perseverance describes a stable mental attitude, realizing in old age that
God’s plan is bigger than any problem either in a preventative measure, or to
give strength in the middle of the problem.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Characteristics of Older Women </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Titus 2:3-5, “reverent in their behavior” is not
sinless perfection, this is the shining forth of inner beauty reflecting the
glory of God in spiritual growth. It is concerned with grace thinking, joy,
mental attitude love, rapport love, and a mastery of the details of life. “Not
malicious gossips” means to not be guilty of the sins of the tongue, not
maligners, gossipers, backbiters, vindictive, and so on.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Older women likewise are to be reverent in their behavior, not
malicious gossips nor enslaved to much wine, teaching what is good, so that
they may encourage the young women to love their husbands, to love their
children, to be sensible, pure, workers at home, kind, being subject to their
own husbands, so that the word of God will not be dishonored.”  (Titus 2:3-5,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Nor enslaved to much wine” means disciplined in their
eating habits and have a mastery of the details of life. “Encourage the young
women” means to teaching the younger through the filling of the Spirit to be
healthy minded, emotionally stable, to have sound judgment, to create an inner
beauty through spiritual growth, to be poised, to be able to stay in fellowship
under pressure, to have <i>phileo</i> rapport love for their husbands and
children.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Sensible” mean to be discreet, poised, in control of
yourself, thoughtful. “Pure” means free from carnality, being in fellowship. “Workers
at home” literally not being lazy in household tasks. This is not a passage
against women working outside the home. “Being subject to their own husbands”
means responding to the husband in the areas that she can respond. This means
to be able to stay in fellowship when the husband puts them in undeserved
suffering.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>From this we conclude there is plenty to do in old age
and old age can be a golden age, not necessarily reliving the good old days,
but actively enjoying the ever present now and the future.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>General Problems of Older Women</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Lack of mental sharpness. If the mind has been neglected
or if Bible doctrine has been neglected this may occur. Failure of the
mentality is bad. There is a danger of disillusionment and becoming disoriented
to life from the standpoint of success standards. You look back and regard your
life as a failure. You had certain goals to meet and now you are old and you’ve
never realized them. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An increase of mental attitude sins with great emphasis
on being critical and judgmental. The things that are overlooked in youth are
horrid in old age. A lack of security, especially if they can’t take care of
themselves or as in most in the older years aren’t able financially to cut it.
Their children are enjoying the prime of life and often their plans do not
include them.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An inability to concentrate, forgetfulness, blank
mindedness, inability to converse, to hear, and to see. Some get used to just
sitting in a chair saying nothing. A lack of motive to live, too much idle
time, too much time for complaining. For example, may desire to travel but
frustrated that travel is out. So there may be lack of something significant to
do!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An inability to decide on something. The decision-making
ability goes bad. For example, planning and executing a trip to town. It may
take two days of intensive planning to make that five minute trip to the
grocery store. Old age often find itself out of phase with the younger
generation, children, and grandchildren. Therefore, a dangerous trend begins
towards hyper-criticism. “Why, when I was a girl, if we saw a dime a month we
were lucky.” And, of course, the inability for the body to perform as it once did.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Spiritually Mature Woman in Old Age</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This passage is directed to older ladies. An older lady
cannot and does not compete with the physical beauty of youth. This ought to
cut the mental attitude strain down by half. She may be a widow and be forced
to take charge of the estate and make decisions her husband used to make. She
therefore operates on the fragrance of memories or absence of memories.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>But time is a wonderful healer and her perspective of
life is going to change. Even though she has lost a dear loved one, <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine in the right lobe of her soul keeps on satisfying and
sustaining. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Romance, beauty, and sex are not her primary emphasis.
That doesn’t mean they cease to exist. Her soul must dominate her body. She may
be wrinkled and have lost the youthful beauty of her body, but with a Christian
older lady, her soul is now ready to reveal all the beauty of her spiritual
maturity, provided that in earlier years she has kept true to the Word of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Full Knowledge and Fellowship in Old Age</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer is commanded to keep on renewing their mind
or soul based in the intake and application of <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine
in the right lobe of the soul. Rom. 12:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by
the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that
which is good and acceptable and perfect.”  (Romans 12:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>From this spiritual growth, we gain more and more of
God's promises and divine truth. Just as we did when we were saved, we are to
keep on believing by faith the promises of God. 2 Peter 1:4-8; Col. 2:6; Rom.
14:23; Heb. 11:6; Heb. 4:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For by these He has granted to us His precious and magnificent
promises, so that by them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having
escaped the corruption that is in the world by lust. Now for this very reason
also, applying all diligence, in your faith supply moral excellence, and in
your moral excellence, knowledge, and in your knowledge, self-control, and in
your self-control, perseverance, and in your perseverance, godliness, and in
your godliness, brotherly kindness, and in your brotherly kindness, love. For
if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they render you neither
useless nor unfruitful in the true knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.” (2
Peter 1:4-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk
in Him,” (Colossians 2:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But he who doubts is condemned if he eats, because his eating
is not from faith; and whatever is not from faith is sin.” (Romans 14:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who
comes to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who
seek Him.” (Hebrews 11:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For indeed we have had good news preached to us, just as they
also; but the word they heard did not profit them, because it was not united by
faith in those who heard.” (Hebrews 4:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Regardless of age, the active use of the Word is by
mixing it with faith, not rationalism, not empiricism, not human IQ, not human
talent and human ability. The crowning glory of old age is full <i>epignosis</i>
knowledge and fellowship. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Summary</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It’s a tragedy to reach old age without having accepted
Jesus Christ as Savior. Very few seem to accept the Gospel and believe in Jesus
Christ in old age. Acts 7:51.</p>

<p class=Verses>““You men who are stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and
ears are always resisting the Holy Spirit; you are doing just as your fathers
did.”  (Acts 7:51, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Old age finds the physical body becoming weaker, but the soul
becomes stronger with age. Eccl. 12:3-7; 2 Cor. 4:16. </p>

<p class=Verses>“in the day that the watchmen of the house tremble, and mighty
men stoop, the grinding ones stand idle because they are few, and those who
look through windows grow dim; and the doors on the street are shut as the
sound of the grinding mill is low, and one will arise at the sound of the bird,
and all the daughters of song will sing softly. Furthermore, men are afraid of
a high place and of terrors on the road; the almond tree blossoms, the
grasshopper drags himself along, and the caperberry is ineffective. For man
goes to his eternal home while mourners go about in the street. Remember Him
before the silver cord is broken and the golden bowl is crushed, the pitcher by
the well is shattered and the wheel at the cistern is crushed; then the dust
will return to the earth as it was, and the spirit will return to God who gave
it.”  (Ecclesiastes 12:3-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore we do not lose heart, but though our outer man is
decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day.”  (2 Corinthians 4:16,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Preparation for old age begins in youth with acceptance
of Jesus Christ as Savior and a constant use of the faith-rest life, keeping in
fellowship, living in the Word, developing in grace, inner joy, mental attitude
love and rapport love, and mastering the details of life. Eccl. 12:1; Eccl.
12:13; the book of Proverbs; the book of Ephesians.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth, before
the evil days come and the years draw near when you will say, “I have no
delight in them”;”  (Ecclesiastes 12:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The conclusion, when all has been heard, is: fear God and keep
His commandments, because this applies to every person.”  (Ecclesiastes 12:13,
NASB)</p>
