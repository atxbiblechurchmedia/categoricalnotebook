<h2><a name="_Nations,_Rise_and"></a>Nations, Rise and Fall</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>International Insecurity</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first principle in the rise and fall of nations is
international insecurity. Although Satan is said to be the prince of this world
in John 12:31, he really does a very poor job of controlling it. Things get out
of hand through the operation of man’s old sin nature collectively and
individually. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Now judgment is upon this world; now the ruler of
this world will be cast out.&quot;  (John 12:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Daniel 7:1-2, “the four winds of heaven were stirring
up the great sea” refers to God’s influence over the rise and fall of nations.
These are disturbing influences upon which Satan has no control. When God wants
to phase out a nation, He can do it quickly, and there is nothing anyone can do
about it. The nations of the world are very insecure today. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel
saw a dream and visions in his mind as he lay on his bed; then he wrote the
dream down and related the following summary of it. Daniel said, &quot;I was
looking in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven were
stirring up the great sea.&quot;  (Daniel 7:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“The waters” in Revelation 17:15 and the “seas” in Isaiah
17:2 refer to nations.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And he said to me, &quot;The waters which you saw where
the harlot sits, are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues.&quot; 
(Revelation 17:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Alas, the uproar of many peoples Who roar like the
roaring of the seas, And the rumbling of nations Who rush on like the rumbling
of mighty waters!&quot;  (Isaiah 17:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>National Personality</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The second principle in the rise and fall of nations is the
principle of national personality. In Daniel 7:3-4, “a lion” refers to Babylon
named because of the rapidity of its conquests. Although Assyria had been
victorious for nearly 400 years, they were conquered in 90 days. The “wings of
an eagle” denotes rapidity of conquest - the First Wind. Babylon conquered the
world in 25 years (625-600 BC). “Wings were plucked” refers to Nebuchadnezzar’s
insanity for seven years. “It was lifted up from the ground” refers to his
restoration to sanity. “A human mind also was given to it” refers to his
conversion. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;And four great beasts were coming up from the sea,
different from one another. &quot;The first was like a lion and had the wings
of an eagle. I kept looking until its wings were plucked, and it was lifted up
from the ground and made to stand on two feet like a man; a human mind also was
given to it.&quot;  (Daniel 7:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Daniel 7:5, “resembling a bear” refers to the Medes
and the Persians - the Second Wind. They were great ponderous powers that
lasted 200 years. Two million Persian soldiers under Xerxes drank Greek lakes
dry. “It was raised up on one side” means the Persian element was stronger than
the Median element. “Three ribs” refers to the beginning of the Persian Empire.
One rib refers to the Medes, one rib refers to the empire of Lydia, and one rib
refers to the Babylon Empire. “Devour much meat” refers to the 200 years of
Persian domination, in which there was much warfare, tremendous number of
conquests, and also many civil wars. During this time was the Golden Age of
Israel (516-323 BC). There was no military interference with Israel resulting
in great economic and spiritual peace. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;And behold, another beast, a second one, resembling
a bear. And it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth
between its teeth; and thus they said to it, 'Arise, devour much meat!'&quot; 
(Daniel 7:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Daniel 7:6, “a leopard” refers to Greece - the Third
Wind. Under Alexander the Great, the Macedonians conquered by hitting fast and
moving on. Conquering began with Greece having 30,000 people and Persia having
4 million under arms. In 12 years, they conquered the world, by winning four
great battles. “Four wings of a bird” refers to these four battles. They are;
1) the Battle of Granicus (334 BC) where Asia Minor was conquered, 2) the
Battle of Issus (333 BC) where the Mediterranean coast as far as Egypt was
taken, 3) the Battle of Gaugamela (331 BC) is also called the battle of Arbela
where the Old Chaldean Empire was conquered including Mesopotamia, and 4) the
Battle of the Persian Gate (330 BC) where Alexander defeated the Persian army
after being ambushed.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;After this I kept looking, and behold, another one,
like a leopard, which had on its back four wings of a bird; the beast also had
four heads, and dominion was given to it.&quot;  (Daniel 7:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Macedonians controlled the Hindu Cush which is a
mountain range with passes which open up travel to India, Afghanistan, China
and Mongolia. Only Alexander the Great has ever accomplished this. Alexander
the Great formulated the Koine Greek language used as the New Testament Greek. Koine
Greek was used extensively for 1000 years (500 BC to 500 AD). </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Daniel 7:6, “four heads” refers to the four generals
who each received a fourth of the Grecian Empire when Alexander died. The four
generals were; Seleucus in Syria, Ptolemy in Egypt, Cassander in Thrace,
Macedonia, and Greece, and Lysimachus in Asia Minor. Cassander was a stupid
general who killed Roxanne, Alexander’s wife, he killed Hercules, Alexander’s
son, and he killed Alexander the Great’s mother. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Roman Empire was the Fourth Wind. The Roman Empire is
the turning point of ancient and modern history. All of the rivers of ancient
civilizations flow into the lake of the Roman Empire and all the rivers of
modern civilization flow out of the lake of the Roman Empire.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The beginning of the second vision is so different from
the others. Rome began as a little village on the bank of the Tiber, then
became a city-state, then a nation, then a great world empire. Rome gave the
world a respect for law and administration - Divine Institution No. 4 -
Nationalism. Greeks were known for their culture, Persians for their science,
and Romans for their code of law.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Characteristics of the Roman Empire can be found in
Daniel 7:7. “Dreadful” refers to the start of conquests in 264 BC and describes
the way they conquered. Over 1 million died in the dreadful Punic wars alone.
From 264 to 146 BC, they conquered Carthage, Egypt, Macedonia, and Syria. They
called themselves Senātus Populusque Rōmānus (SPQR) which is Latin for The
Senate and People of Rome. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;After this I kept looking in the night visions, and
behold, a fourth beast, dreadful and terrifying and extremely strong; and it
had large iron teeth. It devoured and crushed and trampled down the remainder
with its feet; and it was different from all the beasts that were before it,
and it had ten horns.&quot;  (Daniel 7:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Daniel 7:7 “terrifying” refers to the many rich who
were killed in this period, leaving only the middle class and poor. In 146 BC,
the Knights (middle class Romans) took over and there was some stabilization.
However, a mob of 1 million people, poor, dangerous, and ragged came out of the
Punic wars and the tail began to wag the dog. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Knights were capitalistic at first, but switched to a
dualism with a socialistic-capitalistic system. It is the middle class that
always keeps a nation stabilized by operating under free enterprise and
capitalism. Later, the mob took over from the Knights. Who had sustained the
mob? The middle class through Socialism.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As long as the middle class was able to pay the bills and
feed the mob, the civilization survived. Eventually, the middle class reached a
point where they were unable to do so. For example, they destroyed their
currency by going off of the Gold Standard. How? When Alexander the Great
defeated the Persians, the equivalent of 200 billion dollars of hoarded gold
was poured into the world’s economy. But the Romans traded this gold for
peacock feathers and other luxuries from the Orient (China) and also India.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Then they issued paper money which was not tied to a gold
standard. Finally, the mobs and socialism destroyed Rome. It would have been
destroyed sooner, except that Bible doctrine became the great stabilizing
factor during the Antonine Caesars (96-192 AD). The mobs should never be
catered to, or the lower classes. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>How was the destruction of the Roman Empire averted? By
Julius Caesar who was a genius of organization and a dictator. He ruled from
July 28, 46 BC to March 15, 44 BC. He was influential for about five years
before his assassination. The spiritual emphasis here is that Jesus Christ was
born in “the fullness of time.” Religion was bankrupt. Gal. 4:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth
His Son, born of a woman, born under the Law,&quot;  (Galatians 4:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Antonine Caesar era was the greatest period of world
peace the world has ever known apart from the future Millennium. In Daniel 7:7,
“extremely strong” refers to the strength given by law and order, good
communication, the genius of Julius Caesar, the birth of the Lord, and the
dissemination of the Word of God and teaching of Bible doctrine. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Daniel 7:7, “it had large iron teeth. It devoured and
crushed and trampled down the remainder with its feet” refers to the civil wars
in the Roman Empire and the grinding up of the people in these civil wars.
There was moral decay and political decay. The two parties fought it out in
civil wars resulting in widespread slavery. In the Spartacus Revolt, 1,000 slaves
were crucified at one time on the roads leading into the Roman Empire. Reform
was tried, but the reformers were assassinated. The principle here is that the
greatest of reformers cannot save a nation. The greatest of legislation cannot
save a nation. The greatest of armies cannot save a nation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is no hope for a nation’s recovery from degeneracy
and apostacy apart from evangelism and Bible doctrine. This becomes evident
when unbelievers return to the rule of law and the Laws of Divine
Establishment, a significant number of unbelievers turn to God and Jesus Christ
as their Savior, and a significant number of believers return to fellowship
with the Lord leading to the intake and application of Bible doctrine in their
spiritual lives. God will then restore the nation.</p>
