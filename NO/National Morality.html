<h2>National Morality</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A nation can be moral or immoral. A moral nation follows
the divine institutions of Volition, Marriage, Family, and Nationalism. An
immoral nation does not follow or opposes the divine institutions. A moral
nation has objectivity in the rule of law. An immoral nation does not have
objectivity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A moral nation has freedom, privacy and free enterprise.
An immoral nation does not have any of these. A moral nation has military
defending these things. An immoral nation has a military to destroy the
freedom, privacy, and free enterprise of others. An immoral nation goes to
religion. They love the pleasant, the beautiful, and the tinsel. Ezekiel
33:30-33.</p>

<p class=Verses>““But as for you, son of man, your fellow citizens who talk
about you by the walls and in the doorways of the houses, speak to one another,
each to his brother, saying, ‘Come now and hear what the message is which comes
forth from the LORD.’ “They come to you as people come, and sit before you as
My people and hear your words, but they do not do them, for they do the lustful
desires expressed by their mouth, and their heart goes after their gain. “Behold,
you are to them like a sensual song by one who has a beautiful voice and plays
well on an instrument; for they hear your words but they do not practice them. “So
when it comes to pass—as surely it will—then they will know that a prophet has
been in their midst.”“  (Ezekiel 33:30-33, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An immoral nation has an outward form. Isaiah 1:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>““What are your multiplied sacrifices to Me?” Says the LORD. “I
have had enough of burnt offerings of rams And the fat of fed cattle; And I
take no pleasure in the blood of bulls, lambs or goats.”  (Isaiah 1:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An immoral nation has organized crime, bribery, corrupted
courts, and oppression of the poor. Isaiah 1:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Your rulers are rebels And companions of thieves; Everyone
loves a bribe And chases after rewards. They do not defend the orphan, Nor does
the widow’s plea come before them.”  (Isaiah 1:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An immoral nation has increasing drug addiction and demon
possession. Isaiah 2:6-8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For You have abandoned Your people, the house of Jacob,
Because they are filled with influences from the east, And they are soothsayers
like the Philistines, And they strike bargains with the children of foreigners.
Their land has also been filled with silver and gold And there is no end to
their treasures; Their land has also been filled with horses And there is no
end to their chariots. Their land has also been filled with idols; They worship
the work of their hands, That which their fingers have made.”  (Isaiah 2:6-8,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An immoral nation has no respect for authority, immature
rulers, juvenile delinquency, and women ruling homes instead of the men. Isaiah
3:11-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Woe to the wicked! It will go badly with him, For what he
deserves will be done to him. O My people! Their oppressors are children, And
women rule over them. O My people! Those who guide you lead you astray And
confuse the direction of your paths.”  (Isaiah 3:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The men of an immoral nation have the behavior of
spending much of their time chasing after women. Isaiah 3:16-24.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Moreover, the LORD said, &quot;Because the daughters of Zion
are proud And walk with heads held high and seductive eyes, And go along with
mincing steps And tinkle the bangles on their feet,” (Isaiah 3:16, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“Now it will come about that instead of sweet perfume there
will be putrefaction; Instead of a belt, a rope; Instead of well-set hair, a
plucked-out scalp; Instead of fine clothes, a donning of sackcloth; And
branding instead of beauty.” (Isaiah 3:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An immoral nation has their best men being killed in
battle. Isaiah 3:25.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Your men will fall by the sword And your mighty ones in
battle.”  (Isaiah 3:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An immoral nation has greed and lust for the details of
life. They feel they are working too hard to have time to come to Bible class.
Isaiah 5:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Woe to those who add house to house and join field to field,
Until there is no more room, So that you have to live alone in the midst of the
land!”  (Isaiah 5:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An immoral nation is a nation of drunkards. Isaiah 5:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Woe to those who rise early in the morning that they may
pursue strong drink, Who stay up late in the evening that wine may inflame
them!”  (Isaiah 5:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An immoral nation has wholesale sinning. Isaiah 5:l8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Woe to those who drag iniquity with the cords of falsehood,
And sin as if with cart ropes;”  (Isaiah 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An immoral nation has those who twist the Word of God.
Isaiah 5:20-21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil; Who substitute
darkness for light and light for darkness; Who substitute bitter for sweet and
sweet for bitter! Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes And clever in
their own sight!”  (Isaiah 5:20-21, NASB)</p>
