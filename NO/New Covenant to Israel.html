<h2><a name="_New_Covenant_to"></a><a name="_D-The_New_Covenant"></a>New
Covenant to Israel</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The New Covenant is God's promises to the nation of
Israel that Jesus Christ will return to the earth at the Second Advent, restore
Israel as a nation to God, and rule Israel throughout the Millennium. Restored
Israel will continue through the Millennium and into the eternal state. This
covenant fulfills all of God's unconditional promises to Israel. The New
Covenant was declared in Jeremiah 31:31-34.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Behold, days are coming,&quot; declares the LORD,
&quot;when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the
house of Judah, not like the covenant which I made with their fathers in the
day I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, My covenant
which they broke, although I was a husband to them,&quot; declares the LORD.
&quot;But this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after
those days,&quot; declares the LORD, &quot;I will put My law within them and on
their heart I will write it; and I will be their God, and they shall be My
people. &quot;They will not teach again, each man his neighbor and each man his
brother, saying, 'Know the LORD,' for they will all know Me, from the least of
them to the greatest of them,&quot; declares the LORD, &quot;for I will forgive
their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more.&quot;&quot;  (Jeremiah
31:31-34, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses><img width=520 height=340 id="Picture 1"
src="New%20Covenant%20to%20Israel.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Jeremiah 31:31-34, “not like the covenant which I made
with their fathers” refers to the Mosaic Law. “After those days” refers to the
Tribulation. “For they will all know Me” refers to the Millennium. “I was a
husband to them” is an analogy to the faithfulness of the Lord to the Exodus
generation. The Lord was always faithful to them even when they rebelled. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The context of Jeremiah 31 is that Judah, the Southern
Kingdom, had followed in the footsteps of the Northern Kingdom, the ten
northern tribes of Israel. The ten northern tribes had been taken captive in
722 BC. At the time of Jeremiah 31, 586 BC was fast approaching when the
Babylonian captivity of the Southern Kingdom would take place. But even in
those times of great apostacy, God provided a ray of hope. A day yet future
will see the establishment of a New Covenant with Israel.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The New Covenant mentions Israel and Judah because at
this time they were still divided. This covenant is not going to be like the
Mosaic Law, which was broken by the children of Israel. This is going to be an
internal law instead of an external law. The production of this covenant in the
life of the people of Israel will be fantastic.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Two Components of the New Covenant</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are two components to the fulfillment of the New
Covenant. While Jesus Christ was on earth, the first critical component of the
New Covenant was fulfilled in the provision of a Savior for all of mankind.
Fulfillment of the New Covenant for any Jew requires possession of eternal
life. Therefore, fulfillment of the New Covenant requires faith belief in the
salvation work of Jesus Christ on the Cross to gain the eternal life of God at
salvation. Jews must become believers to gain the fulfillment of the New
Covenant. Isaiah 61:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me, Because the LORD
has anointed me To bring good news to the afflicted; He has sent me to bind up
the brokenhearted, To proclaim liberty to captives And freedom to
prisoners;&quot;  (Isaiah 61:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>During the Millennium and into the eternal state, the final
component of the New Covenant will be fulfilled whereby Jesus Christ
establishes His Millennial Kingdom of Israel on earth. Isaiah 61:2-11; Isaiah
59:20-21; Rom. 11:26-27.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;A Redeemer will come to Zion, And to those who turn
from transgression in Jacob,&quot; declares the LORD. &quot;As for Me, this is
My covenant with them,&quot; says the LORD: &quot;My Spirit which is upon you,
and My words which I have put in your mouth shall not depart from your mouth,
nor from the mouth of your offspring, nor from the mouth of your offspring's
offspring,&quot; says the LORD, &quot;from now and forever.&quot;&quot; 
(Isaiah 59:20-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and so all Israel will be saved; just as it is written,
&quot;THE DELIVERER WILL COME FROM ZION, HE WILL REMOVE UNGODLINESS FROM
JACOB.&quot; &quot;THIS IS MY COVENANT WITH THEM, WHEN I TAKE AWAY THEIR
SINS.&quot;&quot;  (Romans 11:26-27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All of Israel’s national failures in history will be
forgiven and Israel will be restored as a nation unto God during the 1000-year
Millennial reign of Christ. The New Covenant to Israel is an eternal covenant.
Ezek. 16:60.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Nevertheless, I will remember My covenant with you
in the days of your youth, and I will establish an everlasting covenant with
you.&quot;  (Ezekiel 16:60, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Therefore, the Jewish recipients of this covenant must
have eternal life to be beneficiaries.  To have eternal life, they must believe
in Jesus Christ as He was revealed in the Old Testament, or as He will be
presented by the 144,000 Jewish evangelists during the Tribulation, or as He
will be presented in the Millennium.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Old Testament Prophecy of the New Covenant</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Joel 2:28-29 refers to the Second Advent when the remnant
of Israel (believing Jews living at the end of the Tribulation) will see the
Messiah and become indwelt and filled with the Holy Spirit.  Peter illustrated
the similarity of that future event with the one that had already happened on
the Day of Pentecost.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;It will come about after this That I will pour out
My Spirit on all mankind; And your sons and daughters will prophesy, Your old
men will dream dreams, Your young men will see visions. &quot;Even on the male
and female servants I will pour out My Spirit in those days.&quot;  (Joel
2:28-29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Joel 2:28-29, the term “pour out” is used in the sense
of placing the Spirit of God within. It carries a concept of indwelling and
filling (spiritually). This passage predicted a future day in which the Holy
Spirit would indwell and fill Jewish believers in the Millennial nation of
Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Peter quotes this announcement of Joel’s in his sermon on
the Day of Pentecost in Acts 2. Peter explained the fact that those filled with
the Holy Spirit on the Day of Pentecost who were speaking in tongues, were not
drunken but they were just paralleling a phenomenon similar to what would
happen at a future date to Israel at the Second Advent. Israel was not in a
condition of belief as a nation when Peter quoted Joel 2. The King was not
reigning on earth. He was not even on earth. He had been crucified, buried, but
had risen and ascended into heaven. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Abrahamic Covenant has three parts - land, seed and
blessing. The New Covenant deals with the blessing part of that original
promise. The blessing is that in a future day (Second Advent) Israel will
experience the same indwelling and filling of the Holy Spirit that occurred
when the Church Age began on the Day of Pentecost. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jewish believers that remain alive at the end of the
Tribulation are all born again (all unbelievers on earth have already been
removed), but they will not have the indwelling or filling of the Holy Spirit
as they are still living in the last seven years of the Age of Israel. When the
Millennial kingdom of Jesus Christ begins, they will gain the indwelling and
filling of the Holy Spirit. This will be similar to what occurred at the Day of
Pentecost for the believers living on that day. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Millennial spirituality will be the result that will
include bonafide ecstatics again similar to that experienced on the Day of
Pentecost. These same ecstatics have not been legitimate in the Church Age
since 70 AD.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Jesus Christ is the Guarantee of the New Covenant</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The New Covenant to Israel is based on the saving work of
Jesus Christ on the Cross. Heb. 7:22. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;so much the more also Jesus has become the guarantee of a
better covenant.&quot;  (Hebrews 7:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We know that the better covenant refers to the New
Covenant because the guarantee of the saving work of Christ on the Cross is
called the Blood of Christ in Hebrews 8:6-13. “Better promises” in Hebrews
8:6-7 is referring to the Mosaic Law and that keeping the Mosaic Law could not
provide eternal salvation.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry, by as
much as He is also the mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted on
better promises. For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would
have been no occasion sought for a second.&quot;  (Hebrews 8:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Jews have a better covenant for the future which will
be the basis for evangelism in the Tribulation and in the Millennium when the New
Covenant will become functional. Jewish believers in the Tribulation will
survive with the hope and motivation from God's promise of the New Covenant<span
style='color:#0432FF'>.</span> Heb. 8:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When He said, &quot;A new covenant,&quot; He has made the
first obsolete. But whatever is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to
disappear.&quot;  (Hebrews 8:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 9:14-16, “the first covenant” refers to the
Mosaic Law. The book of Hebrews was addressed to Jewish believers of the Church
Age and teaches about the future after the Church Age, but also teaches that
God has something far better for Jews who believe in Christ during the Church
Age.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the
eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience
from dead works to serve the living God? For this reason He is the mediator of
a new covenant, so that, since a death has taken place for the redemption of
the transgressions that were committed under the first covenant, those who have
been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance. For where a
covenant is, there must of necessity be the death of the one who made
it.&quot;  (Hebrews 9:14-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ made it possible for the New Covenant to be
fulfilled because He became the mediator between God and the believers of the
nation of Israel by His death on the Cross. The New Covenant is God's
fulfillment of the Abrahamic, Palestinian, and Davidic Covenants to Israel,
both in the Millennium and in the eternal state.  Only those Jews who have
believed in Jesus Christ as their Savior and have been given eternal life will
inherit the benefits of the New Covenant.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Hebrews 10:5-14 emphasizes our Lord’s sacrifice for sin
on the Cross. This sacrifice for sin during our Lord’s First Advent is related
to the New Covenant to Israel. Heb. 10:15-17; Jer. 31:33-34.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us; for after
saying, &quot;THIS IS THE COVENANT THAT I WILL MAKE WITH THEM AFTER THOSE DAYS,
SAYS THE LORD: I WILL PUT MY LAWS UPON THEIR HEART, AND ON THEIR MIND I WILL
WRITE THEM,&quot; He then says, &quot;AND THEIR SINS AND THEIR LAWLESS DEEDS I
WILL REMEMBER NO MORE.&quot;&quot;  (Hebrews 10:15-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But this is the covenant which I will make with the
house of Israel after those days,&quot; declares the LORD, &quot;I will put My
law within them and on their heart I will write it; and I will be their God,
and they shall be My people. &quot;They will not teach again, each man his
neighbor and each man his brother, saying, 'Know the LORD,' for they will all
know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them,&quot; declares the
LORD, &quot;for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no
more.&quot;” (Jeremiah 31:33-34, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mount Zion represents the New Covenant to Israel in Hebrews
12:22. Those Jewish believers who are the eternal recipients of the New
Covenant are described in Hebrews 12:23-24.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the
living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels,&quot;  (Hebrews
12:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;to the general assembly and church of the firstborn who
are enrolled in heaven, and to God, the Judge of all, and to the spirits of the
righteous made perfect, and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to
the sprinkled blood, which speaks better than the blood of Abel.&quot; 
(Hebrews 12:23-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Hebrews 12:24 emphasizes the salvation of the Jews that
is required to inherit the fulfillment of the New Covenant to Israel.
Similarly, Hebrews 13:20 also emphasizes the eternal New Covenant to Israel.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now the God of peace, who brought up from the dead the
great Shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the eternal covenant, even
Jesus our Lord,&quot;  (Hebrews 13:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Communion and the New Covenant</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Since salvation is the same in every dispensation of
human history, the Blood of Christ is represented by the cup in the Church Age
ritual of communion or the Eucharist. When we drink from the cup, we remember
our Savior’s substitutionary spiritual death on the Cross as God's judgment for
our sins and for the sins of all mankind. 1 Cor. 11:25.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;In the same way He took the cup also after supper,
saying, &quot;This cup is the new covenant in My blood; do this, as often as
you drink it, in remembrance of Me.&quot;&quot;  (1 Corinthians 11:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord instituted the ritual of communion the night
before His crucifixion so we would remember what He would accomplish on the Cross
on our behalf. At this Last Supper, He made a specific reference to the New
Covenant to Israel. Luke 22:20. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And in the same way He took the cup after they had eaten,
saying, &quot;This cup which is poured out for you is the new covenant in My
blood.&quot;  (Luke 22:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Since His audience at the Last Supper was strictly
Jewish, our Lord mentioned the New Covenant so that it would be clear that
salvation is always the same in every dispensation and is always revealed. Jesus
Christ was the fulfillment and reality of the Levitical offerings of the Old
Testament. The animal blood that was shed in the Levitical offerings portrayed
the future Jesus Christ as Savior so that Jews could believe.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Communion is the only ritual which belongs to the Church.
It doesn’t belong to Israel. However, the New Covenant which belongs to Israel
is mentioned in this Church Age ritual.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Salvation and the New Covenant</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Salvation through the blood of the New Covenant is the
same as salvation through the blood of the Old Covenant, the Mosaic Law. Under
the Mosaic Law, the Jews remembered salvation through the blood of the animal sacrifices
which taught about the saving work of Jesus Christ to come. Under the blood of
the New Covenant, Church Age believers are saved through faith in the saving
work of Jesus Christ. We look back to the Cross while they looked forward to
the Cross.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Old Testament, the New Covenant to Israel looked
forward to the coming of Jesus Christ, the Messiah and His sacrifice on the Cross
for the sins of mankind. In the New Testament, the New Covenant looks backward
in human history to the reality of Christs’ atonement for sin on the Cross for
all. Therefore, it is sometimes used in salvation passages in a Church Age
context.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God's plan and purpose for believers is different in each
dispensation. However, the means to gain salvation is always the same -
personal faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Old Testament, salvation was taught through the
blood of animal sacrifices.  In the New Testament, salvation is taught through
the Blood of Christ by is His saving work on the Cross.  The Blood of Christ is
used to communicate the basic doctrines of salvation - redemption,
propitiation, and reconciliation.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The New Covenant Does Not Apply to the Church.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The New Covenant applies directly to Israel. That is why
it is called the New Covenant to Israel.  There is no New Covenant to the
Church because there are no covenants in the Church Age.  Covenants belong to Israel.
The Baptism of the Holy Spirit in the Church Age eliminates any covenants for
the Church Age.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Although the New Covenant was known to Israel in the Old
Testament, the mystery doctrine of the Church Age was not revealed until the
Day of Pentecost. Rom. 16:25-26; Col. 1:25-27.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now to Him who is able to establish you according to my
gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the
mystery which has been kept secret for long ages past, but now is manifested,
and by the Scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the
eternal God, has been made known to all the nations, leading to obedience of
faith;&quot;  (Romans 16:25-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Of this church I was made a minister according to the
stewardship from God bestowed on me for your benefit, so that I might fully
carry out the preaching of the word of God, that is, the mystery which has been
hidden from the past ages and generations, but has now been manifested to His
saints, to whom God willed to make known what is the riches of the glory of
this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of
glory.&quot;  (Colossians 1:25-27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Salvation and the Blood of Christ are a part of all
dispensations in human history. Salvation is always the same and is always
clearly revealed in every dispensation. Therefore, the Blood of Christ is
related to the New Covenant and to the Church.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are many Old Testament references to the New
Covenant, therefore it cannot refer to the Church Age because everything about
the Church Age was a mystery and not revealed in the Old Testament.  Therefore,
there is no such thing as a New Covenant to the Church. Jer. 31:31-34, Ezekiel
16:60, Isaiah 59:20-21, Isaiah 61:2-11, Hosea 2:14-23. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Nevertheless, I will remember My covenant with you
in the days of your youth, and I will establish an everlasting covenant with
you.&quot;  (Ezekiel 16:60, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;A Redeemer will come to Zion, And to those who turn
from transgression in Jacob,&quot; declares the LORD. &quot;As for Me, this is
My covenant with them,&quot; says the LORD: &quot;My Spirit which is upon you,
and My words which I have put in your mouth shall not depart from your mouth,
nor from the mouth of your offspring, nor from the mouth of your offspring's
offspring,&quot; says the LORD, &quot;from now and forever.&quot;&quot; 
(Isaiah 59:20-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The New Covenant to Israel is mentioned many times in the
book of Hebrews to indicate that the Church is not under the Mosaic Law. Heb.
8:6-13, Heb. 9:1, Heb. 9:11-22, Heb. 10:15-20, Heb. 10:28-29, Heb. 12:18-29,
Heb. 13:20-21.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry, by as
much as He is also the mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted on
better promises. For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would
have been no occasion sought for a second.&quot;  (Hebrews 8:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now even the first covenant had regulations of divine
worship and the earthly sanctuary.&quot;  (Hebrews 9:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Anyone who has set aside the Law of Moses dies without
mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses. How much severer punishment
do you think he will deserve who has trampled under foot the Son of God, and
has regarded as unclean the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified,
and has insulted the Spirit of grace?&quot;  (Hebrews 10:28-29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Here, the Old Covenant (Mosaic Law) and the New Covenant
to Israel are contrasted. The Mosaic Law resulted in a legalistic distortion of
its intent. Salvation has always been only by non-meritorious belief in the
work of Jesus Christ on the Cross for the sins of mankind. Salvation has always
been a gift of God's grace through faith. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The New Covenant was called new before the First Advent
and the Church existed. Therefore, the New Covenant applies only to Israel in
the past and in the future, but does not apply to the Church except in the
presentation of the Gospel.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Church is Not Under the Mosaic Law</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Old Covenant or Mosaic Law was ended by the
substitutionary spiritual death of Jesus Christ on the Cross for our sins. Rom
10:4.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to
everyone who believes.&quot;  (Romans 10:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The humanity of Our Lord Jesus Christ was the only one to
ever completely fulfill all mandates of the Mosaic Law. Matt 5:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the
Prophets; I did not come to abolish but to fulfill.&quot;  (Matthew 5:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Church is no longer under the Mosaic Law. Rom 6:14,
Gal 2:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For sin shall not be master over you, for you are not
under law but under grace.&quot;  (Romans 6:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;For through the Law I died to the Law, so that I
might live to God.&quot;  (Galatians 2:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The end of the Mosaic Law required a New Covenant for
Israel that guarantees eternal life for the Jewish believer in the Tribulation
and the Millennium. The New Covenant replaces the Mosaic Law for the function
of Israel’s priesthood in the Millennial temple. Ezekiel 40-48.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Summary</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The New Covenant is God's unfulfilled promise to Israel.
It emphasizes that even though the nation of Israel was judged by God in the fifth
cycle of discipline in 70 AD and dispersed throughout the world, God will keep
His promise at the Second Advent. In spite of Israel’s failures and diaspora in
the past, it does not mean that God has broken His covenants with Israel. All
Jewish believers of the Old Testament, Tribulation, and Millennium will be
blessed under the New Covenant. Rom. 11:1, Rom. 11:27, Gal. 4:4, Heb. 8:8-12,
Heb.10:15-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I say then, God has not rejected His people, has He? May
it never be! For I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe
of Benjamin.&quot;  (Romans 11:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth
His Son, born of a woman, born under the Law,&quot;  (Galatians 4:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us; for after
saying, &quot;THIS IS THE COVENANT THAT I WILL MAKE WITH THEM AFTER THOSE DAYS,
SAYS THE LORD: I WILL PUT MY LAWS UPON THEIR HEART, AND ON THEIR MIND I WILL
WRITE THEM,&quot; He then says, &quot;AND THEIR SINS AND THEIR LAWLESS DEEDS I
WILL REMEMBER NO MORE.&quot;&quot;  (Hebrews 10:15-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>No Jew qualifies for the New Covenant to Israel apart
from salvation through personal faith in the work of Jesus Christ on the Cross.
Old Testament, Tribulational, and Millennial Jews cannot enter into the New Covenant
apart from salvation through faith in Christ.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believing Jews living in the Church Age are the
exception. They do not inherit the New Covenant because they are no longer
Jews, but members of the Body of Christ. In the Church Age, there are no racial
distinctions. Jews who believes in Christ during the Church Age receive the
baptism of the Holy Spirit as do all believers. They are no longer Jews, but in
union with Jesus Christ and, therefore, members the Body of Christ. Rom. 10:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for
the same Lord is Lord of all, abounding in riches for all who call on
Him;&quot;  (Romans 10:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Conclusion</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Abraham was promised land, seed and blessing. The land
afforded the nation Israel a geographical location, always needed in the case
of any nation. The land was Israel’s as far as the title deed, but to possess
and enjoy the land they had to be obedient. They, of course, failed to be
obedient through the Mosaic Law, so a New Covenant was invoked that provided
for inward stability, forgiveness of sins, a new heart and mind, and a new
nature. But, this New Covenant was dependent upon the Davidic Covenant for a
qualified One had to come and die for the sins of the world. Finally, all of
these covenants will be fulfilled at the Second Advent.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Thus, at the Second Advent, believers in Israel will be,
as a nation, indwelt and filled with the Holy Spirit. Spirituality (being
filled with the Holy Spirit) in the Millennium will involve more legitimate
emotion because the King will be physically ruling on earth. Because Israel
will contain only Jewish believers at the beginning of the Millennium, Israel
will be obedient to God’s Word. Because they will be obedient, they will enjoy
the land. They will need the perfect and qualified ruler and administrator, the
seed of David, the Lord Jesus Christ who will sit on David’s throne and He will
rule them with perfect justice in perfect environment.</p>
