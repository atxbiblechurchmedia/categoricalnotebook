<h2>Nations, Destruction</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are always those who are plotting war. It is a part
of the old sin nature of mankind. James 4:1; Psalms 55:20-23; Psalms 68:30;
Psalms 120:6-7; Psalms 140:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“What is the source of quarrels and conflicts among you? Is not
the source your pleasures that wage war in your members?”&nbsp;&nbsp;(James
4:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He has put forth his hands against those who were at peace
with him; He has violated his covenant. His speech was smoother than butter,
But his heart was war; His words were softer than oil, Yet they were drawn
swords. Cast your burden upon the LORD and He will sustain you; He will never
allow the righteous to be shaken. But You, O God, will bring them down to the
pit of destruction; Men of bloodshed and deceit will not live out half their
days. But I will trust in You.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 55:20-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Rebuke the beasts in the reeds, The herd of bulls with the
calves of the peoples, Trampling under foot the pieces of silver; He has
scattered the peoples who delight in war.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 68:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Too long has my soul had its dwelling With those who hate
peace. I am for peace, but when I speak, They are for war.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms
120:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the choir director. A Psalm of David. Rescue me, O LORD,
from evil men; Preserve me from violent men Who devise evil things in their
hearts; They continually stir up wars.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 140:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Peace propaganda is used as one of the greatest weapons
of warfare. The easiest way to whip someone is to talk peace and not fight,
then unexpectedly you hit them, and hit them hard catching them off balance. Micah
3:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Thus says the LORD concerning the prophets who lead my people
astray; When they have something to bite with their teeth, They cry,
&quot;Peace,&quot; But against him who puts nothing in their mouths They
declare holy war.” (Micah 3:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The source of this peace propaganda is false preachers
such as those belonging to the National Council of Churches. In Micah 3:5, “bite
with their teeth” means they talk sweetly of peace!  They say, “peace and let’s
disarm and show the world the way to world brotherhood.”  Countries will talk
of peace as they prepare for war. This is exactly the way countries that oppose
America work. Many countries have been sold the UN’s peace propaganda. Their
literature is filled with it. You can hear it from their pulpits. They talk
about disarmament, world peace, and they talk about understanding. They offer peace
overtures. They offer you the dove while preparing to let you have it. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Micah 3:6 goes on to say that once the people of a nation
receive any type of peace propaganda, they have lost their vision. They are
confused. They will be destroyed. They have no divine discernment.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore it will be night for you—without vision, And
darkness for you—without divination. The sun will go down on the prophets, And
the day will become dark over them.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Micah 3:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Micah 3:7, there is no answer from God. One of the
worst things that can happen is to be a sucker for the peace movements, either
from within or without.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The seers will be ashamed And the diviners will be
embarrassed. Indeed, they will all cover their mouths Because there is no
answer from God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Micah 3:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God set up a law for the perpetuation of a nation in two
words - military establishment. No nation in history has ever survived the
destruction or the demoralization of its military establishment.</p>
