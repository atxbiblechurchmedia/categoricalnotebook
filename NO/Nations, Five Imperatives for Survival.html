<h2>Nations, Five Imperatives for Survival</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are five imperatives by which our nation can be
delivered. In 2 Corinthians 13:11, the first imperative is to “rejoice” and is
the present active imperative of <span lang=EL>χαι</span>́<span lang=EL>ρω</span>
(chairō) and means to keep on possessing inner happiness, to keep on
rejoicing. Note that before this first imperative, the word “finally” is <span
lang=EL>λοιποι</span>́ (loipoi) and is used adverbially and means “as for the
rest is concerned.” The first command is to become a mature believer in the
spiritual life! A command to take in Bible doctrine on a daily basis, a crash
program if needed and staying with it. The idea is, “Where do we go from here?”
“What hope do we have?” We also have a vocative plural of <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span
lang=EL>δελφο</span>́<span lang=EL>ς</span> (adelphos) which addresses all
believers in the Body of Christ, members of the family of God.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Finally, brethren, rejoice, be made complete, be comforted, be
like-minded, live in peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you.” 
(2 Corinthians 13:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The characteristics of a mature believer are capacity for
freedom, capacity for life, capacity for love, and capacity for happiness. The
greatest weapon we have in preserving our nation is the mature believer. How
many do we have in this country? The concept is an equipped home, many equipped
homes, and an equipped nation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The second imperative is to “be made complete” and is the
present passive imperative of <span lang=EL>καταρτι</span>́<span lang=EL>ζω</span>
(katartizō). This is the believer receiving doctrine and thus being
stabilized. The second command is for believers in the nation to reach
spiritual maturity. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This word is used in five different ways in the New
Testament. It is used a mechanical term in 1 Corinthians 1:10, “to tune up the
machine.” It is used as a commercial fishing term in 1 Peter 5:10, “mending
fishing nets.” It is used as a medical term in Galatians 6:1, “to set a broken
bone.” It is used as a naval functional term in 1 Thessalonians 3:10, “to
supply a fleet so that it may operate.” It is used as a military term in 1 Corinthians
13:11 “to equip an army for combat.” Bible doctrine equips a believer for
combat, for the function of the spiritual life in spiritual maturity. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now I exhort you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ, that you all agree and that there be no divisions among you, but that
you be made complete in the same mind and in the same judgment.&quot;  (1
Corinthians 1:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;After you have suffered for a little while, the God of
all grace, who called you to His eternal glory in Christ, will Himself perfect,
confirm, strengthen and establish you.&quot;  (1 Peter 5:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Brethren, even if anyone is caught in any trespass, you
who are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; each one
looking to yourself, so that you too will not be tempted.&quot;  (Galatians
6:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;as we night and day keep praying most earnestly that we
may see your face, and may complete what is lacking in your faith?&quot;  (1
Thessalonians 3:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Achieving the first two imperatives are achieved in the
same way - the daily, persistent, and consistent intake of Bible doctrine.
Bible doctrine should be more important than anything else in your life. The members
of the family of God are to keep on having inner happiness, to keep on being
equipped with a constructed edification complex of the soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The third imperative is to<b> </b>“be comforted” and is
the present passive imperative of <span lang=EL>παρακαλε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(parakaleō). In the passive voice, this means to keep on receiving warning, to
keep on receiving comfort, to keep on receiving encouragement. The believer
receives warning and comfort from the Bible doctrine already assimilated and
from what is currently being learned. This is the daily function of the grace
apparatus for perception.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fourth imperative is to “be like-minded” and is the
present active imperative from the verb <span lang=EL>φρονε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (phroneō) and means to think objectively, to be “one minded.”
It means to have Bible doctrine in the heart, in the right lobe of the soul. It
is referring to the frame of reference, the memory center, vocabulary, and the conscience.
It means to keep on thinking objectively with divine viewpoint. Rom. 12:3.
Phil. 2:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For through the grace given to me I say to everyone among you
not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think; but to think so as
to have sound judgment, as God has allotted to each a measure of faith.”
(Romans 12:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is
any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any
affection and compassion, make my joy complete by being of the same mind,
maintaining the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose.”
(Philippians 2:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fifth imperative is to “live in peace”<b> </b>and<b> </b>is
the present active imperative of <span lang=EL>ει</span>̓<span lang=EL>ρηνευ</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (eirēneuō) and means to live in harmony and prosperity,
blessing, benefit, profit, to be prospered, to be at peace with your enemies. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The conclusion from keeping these five imperatives is
that “the God of love and peace will be with you.” This is the future active
indicative of <span lang=EL>ει</span>̓<span lang=EL>μι</span>́ (eimi) and means
that this is the future for our country. Today, we are in apostacy that has
almost taken over Christianity. However, we have Bible doctrine! The believer’s
attitude towards Bible doctrine, your own self-discipline, your respect for
your pastor-teacher, and your respect for authority will carry us through!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The corrected translation of 2 Corinthians 13:11 is, “For
the rest of it, members of the family of God, keep on having inner happiness,
keep on being equipped, keep on receiving comfort, keep on thinking
objectively, be living in prosperity, and the God of love and peace shall be
with you.”</p>
