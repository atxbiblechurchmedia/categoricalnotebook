<h2>National Stability and Human Freedom</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Ten Commandments are the Magna Charta of human
freedom. The Year of Jubilee in Codex 3 of Mosaic Law is also designed to
maintain and continue the freedom of a nation. Exodus 20:2; Deut. 5.6; Lev.
25:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land
of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.” (Exodus 20:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“'I am the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of
Egypt, out of the house of slavery.” (Deuteronomy 5:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“'You shall thus consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim a
release through the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you,
and each of you shall return to his own property, and each of you shall return
to his family.” (Leviticus 25:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As the Mosaic Law provided freedom in the Age of Israel,
so today the Holy Spirit provides freedom for the believer in the Church Age.
Today in America we have a double freedom. We have the physical freedom of the
structure of our nation. We also have the spiritual freedom of the indwelling
presence of the Holy Spirit and the grace way of being filled with the Holy
Spirit. 2 Cor. 3:17; Rom. 8:2-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord
is, there is liberty.” (2 Corinthians 3:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you
free from the law of sin and of death. For what the Law could not do, weak as
it was through the flesh, God did: sending His own Son in the likeness of
sinful flesh and as an offering for sin, He condemned sin in the flesh, so that
the requirement of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according
to the flesh but according to the Spirit.” (Romans 8:2-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Slavery was a national issue in Jeremiah’s day. He
constantly warned them against soul slavery. Soul slavery leads to physical
slavery or death. Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the soul provides freedom
from soul slavery. That’s the thing that can save our country. Jer. 34:8-17; John
8:30-36; James 1:25; James 2:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“that each man should set free his male servant and each man
his female servant, a Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman; so that no one should keep
them, a Jew his brother, in bondage.” (Jeremiah 34:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But afterward they turned around and took back the male
servants and the female servants whom they had set free, and brought them into
subjection for male servants and for female servants.” (Jeremiah 34:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Therefore thus says the LORD, 'You have not obeyed Me in
proclaiming release each man to his brother and each man to his neighbor.
Behold, I am proclaiming a release to you,' declares the LORD, 'to the sword,
to the pestilence and to the famine; and I will make you a terror to all the
kingdoms of the earth.” (Jeremiah 34:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“As He spoke these things, many came to believe in Him. So
Jesus was saying to those Jews who had believed Him, &quot;If you continue in
My word, then you are truly disciples of Mine; and you will know the truth, and
the truth will make you free.&quot; They answered Him, &quot;We are Abraham's
descendants and have never yet been enslaved to anyone; how is it that You say,
'You will become free'?&quot; Jesus answered them, &quot;Truly, truly, I say to
you, everyone who commits sin is the slave of sin. &quot;The slave does not
remain in the house forever; the son does remain forever. &quot;So if the Son
makes you free, you will be free indeed.” (John 8:30-36, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But one who looks intently at the perfect law, the law of
liberty, and abides by it, not having become a forgetful hearer but an
effectual doer, this man will be blessed in what he does.” (James 1:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So speak and so act as those who are to be judged by the law
of liberty.” (James 2:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Eternal liberty belongs to the children of God. Our
eternal freedom is related to the doctrine of Redemption. Our Lord Jesus Christ
bought us out of the slave-market of sin. Rom. 8:21; Isaiah 61:1; Luke 4:18-20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“that the creation itself also will be set free from its
slavery to corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God.”
(Romans 8:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me, Because the LORD has
anointed me To bring good news to the afflicted; He has sent me to bind up the
brokenhearted, To proclaim liberty to captives And freedom to prisoners;”
(Isaiah 61:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS UPON ME, BECAUSE HE ANOINTED
ME TO PREACH THE GOSPEL TO THE POOR. HE HAS SENT ME TO PROCLAIM RELEASE TO THE
CAPTIVES, AND RECOVERY OF SIGHT TO THE BLIND, TO SET FREE THOSE WHO ARE
OPPRESSED, TO PROCLAIM THE FAVORABLE YEAR OF THE LORD.&quot; And He closed the
book, gave it back to the attendant and sat down; and the eyes of all in the
synagogue were fixed on Him.” (Luke 4:18-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Positional Sanctification provides freedom from the old
sin nature. Experiential Sanctification provides daily freedom to serve God. A
believer to be effective must be freed from the slavery of the old sin nature. Rom.
6:7; Rom. 6:16-20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“for he who has died is freed from sin.” (Romans 6:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do you not know that when you present yourselves to someone as
slaves for obedience, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin
resulting in death, or of obedience resulting in righteousness? But thanks be
to God that though you were slaves of sin, you became obedient from the heart
to that form of teaching to which you were committed, and having been freed
from sin, you became slaves of righteousness. I am speaking in human terms
because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you presented your members
as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness, resulting in further lawlessness, so
now present your members as slaves to righteousness, resulting in
sanctification. For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to
righteousness.” (Romans 6:16-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Therefore, liberty is the modus vivendi of Christianity.
That means that every born-again believer even with a thimble-full of doctrine
ought to understand freedom, privacy, free enterprise, and patriotism. Gal.
5:13; 1 Peter 2:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For you were called to freedom, brethren; only do not turn
your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one
another.” (Galatians 5:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Act as free men, and do not use your freedom as a covering for
evil, but use it as bondslaves of God.” (1 Peter 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Legalism seeks to enslave the believer and destroy
personal liberty. This is why false teachers are in the slavery of legalism,
but they are always promising freedom to their victims. Gal. 2:4; 2 Peter 2:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But it was because of the false brethren secretly brought in,
who had sneaked in to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, in
order to bring us into bondage.” (Galatians 2:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“promising them freedom while they themselves are slaves of
corruption; for by what a man is overcome, by this he is enslaved.” (2 Peter
2:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Freedom provides that stability of soul necessary for
both occupation with Christ and worship. 2 Chron. 29:31.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Hezekiah said, &quot;Now that you have consecrated
yourselves to the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings to
the house of the LORD.&quot; And the assembly brought sacrifices and thank
offerings, and all those who were willing brought burnt offerings.” (2
Chronicles 29:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Since salvation and the intake and application of Bible
doctrine provide freedom of soul, human slavery or body slavery does not hinder
a believer from serving God. That is why Paul says there, “Look, if you are a
slave when you accept Jesus Christ as Savior, do not try to break out of
slavery. Even though you are a slave, you are free to serve God. And if you are
free when you accepted Christ, just remember you are a slave unto the Lord, to
serve Him.” 1 Cor. 7:20-23; Gal. 3:28.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Each man must remain in that condition in which he was called.
Were you called while a slave? Do not worry about it; but if you are able also
to become free, rather do that. For he who was called in the Lord while a
slave, is the Lord's freedman; likewise he who was called while free, is
Christ's slave. You were bought with a price; do not become slaves of men.” (1
Corinthians 7:20-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor
free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ
Jesus.” (Galatians 3:28, NASB)</p>
