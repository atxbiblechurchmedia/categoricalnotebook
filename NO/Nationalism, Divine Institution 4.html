<h2>Nationalism, Divine Institution #4</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Nationalism is defined as loyalty and devotion to and
advocacy of a nation especially in the sense of a national consciousness
exalting one nation above all others and placing primary emphasis on promotion
of its culture and interests as opposed to those of other nations or
supranational groups.  In Genesis 10, a nation was a group of people living in
a geographical location, differentiated by language, race distinction, or
nationality, and under a separate governmental with a civil and social
structure.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The divine viewpoint of the ideal of a nation is a group
of people located together with one common origin, one language, one stock of
descent, of one race, distinguished from others, and functioning under the
other three divine institutions within that national entity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Webster defines a nation as “a people connected by
supposed ties of blood generally manifested by community of language, religion,
and customs. An aggregation of people having like institutions and customs and
a sense of social homogeneity and mutual interest. A body of inhabitants of a
country united under a single independent government.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Nationalism is a number of independent government entities
with each functioning over a segment of the human race. Nationalism is the
means of protecting and perpetuating the human race in order that no segment of
the human race will gain so much power so as to destroy the rest of the human
race and inevitably destroy themselves. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Nationalism biblically would be a principle common to all
nations binding the people within those nations separately in allegiance,
mutual interest and welfare of their own particular national entity. Nationalism
is a principle within a nation which protects and perpetuates the human race.
It divides the nations geographically, racially, and linguistically.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Internationalism puts other nations under slavery by
violating Divine Institution #1 - Volition. Any form of Internationalism (more
than one nation under one head) gives satanic control. Satan is frustrated by a
large number of national entities with definite boundaries. The national entity
is a human barrier against the supremacy of evil in the world controlled by
Satan.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As a divine institution, nationalism as well as volition,
marriage and family has a structure of expression and definition. The structure
for the expression of nationalism includes the military, a system of laws, a
system of spirituality, a system of economy, a system of taxation, a system of
justice, a system of welfare, a system of punishment for crime, a system of
morality, a system of independence, freedom from internationalism, a system of
preservation of resources, a balance of powers with other nations, national
competition in the free market, and maximum evangelization with the Gospel.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>World peace depends upon a balance of power between national
entities. When nationalism is in operation, world-wide evangelism is possible.
When you have internationalism in control, you have heathenism or negative
volition at the point of God consciousness. A major passage condemning
internationalism and backing nationalism can be found in Genesis 11:1-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now the whole earth used the same language and the same words.
It came about as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of
Shinar and settled there. They said to one another, “Come, let us make bricks
and burn them thoroughly.” And they used brick for stone, and they used tar for
mortar. They said, “Come, let us build for ourselves a city, and a tower whose
top will reach into heaven, and let us make for ourselves a name, otherwise we
will be scattered abroad over the face of the whole earth.” The LORD came down
to see the city and the tower which the sons of men had built. The LORD said, “Behold,
they are one people, and they all have the same language. And this is what they
began to do, and now nothing which they purpose to do will be impossible for
them. “Come, let Us go down and there confuse their language, so that they will
not understand one another’s speech.” So the LORD scattered them abroad from
there over the face of the whole earth; and they stopped building the city.
Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the LORD confused the
language of the whole earth; and from there the LORD scattered them abroad over
the face of the whole earth.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis 11:1-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The existence of nations in the Millennium will be a
memorial to the grace of God in preserving the human race so that they would
have a choice. Rev. 20:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and he threw him into the abyss, and shut it and sealed it
over him, so that he would not deceive the nations any longer, until the
thousand years were completed; after these things he must be released for a
short time.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation 20:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Nationalism does not sanction personal revenge. We are to
leave it to the justice of God. “Vengeance is Mine, I will repay, says the
Lord.” Rom. 12:19. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Never take your own revenge, beloved, but leave room for the
wrath of God, for it is written, “VENGEANCE IS MINE, I WILL REPAY,” says the
Lord.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 12:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are two means of handling opposition to the
believer. The first is to commit it to the Lord as is the believer’s mandate in
the spiritual life. The second is to commit it to the law of our land which is
the believer’s nationalist operation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>A Military System as an Illustration of Nationalism</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The illustration of the principle of nationalism is the
nation of Israel’s military system. The Hebrew army had a draft system. This is
taken from the Hebrew word for “send” and “furnished” in the Hebrew. In Numbers
31:4-5, “send” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שׁלח</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(shâlach) and means
to send away and “furnished” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>מסר</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(mâsar) and means to
set apart, to furnish, to commit, to deliver.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;A thousand from each tribe of all the tribes of Israel
you shall send to the war.&quot; So there were furnished from the thousands of
Israel, a thousand from each tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.” (Numbers
31:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The purpose for war is self-preservation. War is for
adults and the undistracted. Deut. 20:4; Deut. 20:5-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“for the LORD your God is the one who goes with you, to fight
for you against your enemies, to save you.'” (Deuteronomy 20:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>War is designed to annihilate the enemy. Deut. 20:16-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Only in the cities of these peoples that the LORD your
God is giving you as an inheritance, you shall not leave alive anything that
breathes. &quot;But you shall utterly destroy them, the Hittite and the
Amorite, the Canaanite and the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite, as the
LORD your God has commanded you, so that they may not teach you to do according
to all their detestable things which they have done for their gods, so that you
would sin against the LORD your God.” (Deuteronomy 20:16-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Decisions of warfare were in the hands of the military
leaders, not the civilian diplomats. Prov. 24:6. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For by wise guidance you will wage war, And in abundance of
counselors there is victory.” (Proverbs 24:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>War was designed and executed as an expression of divine
judgment on wicked nations. For example, the conquest of Canaan in the book of
Joshua. Justified warfare is from God. 1 Chron. 5:19-20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“They made war against the Hagrites, Jetur, Naphish and Nodab.
They were helped against them, and the Hagrites and all who were with them were
given into their hand; for they cried out to God in the battle, and He answered
their prayers because they trusted in Him.” (1 Chronicles 5:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There were a number of types of weaponry used in the
military and training was required. 1 Chron. 12:23-40. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Now these are the numbers of the divisions equipped for war,
who came to David at Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to
the word of the LORD. The sons of Judah who bore shield and spear were 6,800,
equipped for war.” (1 Chronicles 12:23-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Of Zebulun, there were 50,000 who went out in the army, who
could draw up in battle formation with all kinds of weapons of war and helped
David with an undivided heart.” (1 Chronicles 12:33, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Of Naphtali there were 1,000 captains, and with them 37,000
with shield and spear. Of the Danites who could draw up in battle formation,
there were 28,600. Of Asher there were 40,000 who went out in the army to draw
up in battle formation.” (1 Chronicles 12:34-36, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“From the other side of the Jordan, of the Reubenites and the
Gadites and of the half-tribe of Manasseh, there were 120,000 with all kinds of
weapons of war for the battle.” (1 Chronicles 12:37, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They had a well-organized army and system of warfare.
Officers included the Commander in chief (1 Sam. 14:50), General of divisions
(Num. 2:3-31), and Captains of thousands, hundreds, and fifties. (Num. 31:14,
Num. 31:48).</p>

<p class=Verses>“The name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz.
And the name of the captain of his army was Abner the son of Ner, Saul's
uncle.” (1 Samuel 14:50, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Now those who camp on the east side toward the sunrise
shall be of the standard of the camp of Judah, by their armies, and the leader
of the sons of Judah: Nahshon the son of Amminadab,” (Numbers 2:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Moses was angry with the officers of the army, the captains of
thousands and the captains of hundreds, who had come from service in the war.”
(Numbers 31:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Military tactics included camp and march (Num. 2),
marching in ranks (Exodus 13:18), move in attack in three divisions (Judges
7:16), and orders delivered with trumpets (2 Sam. 2:28).</p>

<p class=Verses>“Hence God led the people around by the way of the wilderness
to the Red Sea; and the sons of Israel went up in martial array from the land
of Egypt.” (Exodus 13:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He divided the 300 men into three companies, and he put
trumpets and empty pitchers into the hands of all of them, with torches inside
the pitchers.” (Judges 7:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So Joab blew the trumpet; and all the people halted and
pursued Israel no longer, nor did they continue to fight anymore.” (2 Samuel
2:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Military strategies included ambushes (Josh 8:2-22),
reconnaissance (Josh. 2:1-24), delays (2 Sam. 17:7-14), pursuit (Joshua 11:7),
forced marches (Isaiah 5:26-27),  sieges (Jer. 39:1), fortifications (Judges
9:31), standards with flags (Num. 2:2-3, Num. 2:10), and uniforms (Ezek. 23:6,
Nahum 2:3).</p>

<p class=Verses>“So Joshua and all the people of war with him came upon them
suddenly by the waters of Merom, and attacked them.” (Joshua 11:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He will also lift up a standard to the distant nation, And
will whistle for it from the ends of the earth; And behold, it will come with
speed swiftly. No one in it is weary or stumbles, None slumbers or sleeps; Nor
is the belt at its waist undone, Nor its sandal strap broken.” (Isaiah 5:26-27,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now when Jerusalem was captured in the ninth year of Zedekiah
king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his
army came to Jerusalem and laid siege to it;” (Jeremiah 39:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He sent messengers to Abimelech deceitfully, saying,
&quot;Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his relatives have come to Shechem; and
behold, they are stirring up the city against you.” (Judges 9:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;On the south side shall be the standard of the camp of
Reuben by their armies, and the leader of the sons of Reuben: Elizur the son of
Shedeur,” (Numbers 2:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Oholah played the harlot while she was Mine; and she
lusted after her lovers, after the Assyrians, her neighbors, who were clothed
in purple, governors and officials, all of them desirable young men, horsemen
riding on horses.” (Ezekiel 23:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Weapons and armor included bow and arrow, artillery,
battle ax, dagger, javelin, dart, shield, sling, chariot, sword, engine, coat
of mail, helmet, breastplate, greave, and habergeon. They had a standing army.
1 Sam. 13:2. They had a choir and songs. 2 Chron. 20:21-22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now Saul chose for himself 3,000 men of Israel, of which 2,000
were with Saul in Michmash and in the hill country of Bethel, while 1,000 were
with Jonathan at Gibeah of Benjamin. But he sent away the rest of the people,
each to his tent.” (1 Samuel 13:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“When he had consulted with the people, he appointed those who
sang to the LORD and those who praised Him in holy attire, as they went out
before the army and said, &quot;Give thanks to the LORD, for His lovingkindness
is everlasting.&quot; When they began singing and praising, the LORD set
ambushes against the sons of Ammon, Moab and Mount Seir, who had come against
Judah; so they were routed.” (2 Chronicles 20:21-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Rewards were given for meritorious conduct, generally an
offer of the general’s daughter in marriage. Joshua 15:16-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And Caleb said, &quot;The one who attacks Kiriath-sepher and
captures it, I will give him Achsah my daughter as a wife.&quot; Othniel the
son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, captured it; so he gave him Achsah his
daughter as a wife.” (Joshua 15:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Children were instructed in military arts.
Insubordination under command was punished. 2 Sam. 1:18; 2 Sam. 14:17.</p>

14:17, NASB)</p>
