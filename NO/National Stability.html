<h2>National Stability</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Stability through Law and Order</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has ordained certain laws for each nation. They come from
of the divine institutions. God is not the author of confusion. Rom. 13:1-2; 1
Cor. 14:40.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Every person is to be in subjection to the governing
authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist
are established by God. Therefore whoever resists authority has opposed the
ordinance of God; and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon
themselves.” (Romans 13:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But all things must be done properly and in an orderly
manner.” (1 Corinthians 14:40, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Rulers have the authority to uphold the laws of the land under
the four divine institutions; Freedom, Marriage, Family, and Nationalism. The
believer under those laws should not fear the enforcement of those laws. Rom.
13:3-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior, but for
evil. Do you want to have no fear of authority? Do what is good and you will
have praise from the same; for it is a minister of God to you for good. But if
you do what is evil, be afraid; for it does not bear the sword for nothing; for
it is a minister of God, an avenger who brings wrath on the one who practices
evil. Therefore it is necessary to be in subjection, not only because of wrath,
but also for conscience' sake.” (Romans 13:3-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The government has the authority to retain law and order and
even to exercise capital punishment as their laws dictate. The government also has
means to finance the privileges that accrue to its citizens by taxation with
representation. Rom. 13:6-7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For because of this you also pay taxes, for rulers are
servants of God, devoting themselves to this very thing. Render to all what is
due them: tax to whom tax is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear;
honor to whom honor.” (Romans 13:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Under certain conditions, the law of God (Bible doctrine)
supersedes the laws of the government. There must be a clear distinction
between church and government. The believer has a responsibility to the government,
but they are two different kingdoms, one earthy, one heavenly. The believer is
to support good government, but never become that government. Matt. 22:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“They said to Him, &quot;Caesar's.&quot; Then He said to them,
&quot;Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and to God the things
that are God's.&quot;” (Matthew 22:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Spiritual Leadership Protects National Stability</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Old Testament - The Prophet and Levitical Priest</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Old Testament, the prophet was the man for a
national crisis. Isaiah was an example in Isaiah 20:1-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“In the year that the commander came to Ashdod, when Sargon the
king of Assyria sent him and he fought against Ashdod and captured it, at that
time the LORD spoke through Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, &quot;Go and loosen
the sackcloth from your hips and take your shoes off your feet.&quot; And he
did so, going naked and barefoot. And the LORD said, &quot;Even as My servant
Isaiah has gone naked and barefoot three years as a sign and token against
Egypt and Cush, so the king of Assyria will lead away the captives of Egypt and
the exiles of Cush, young and old, naked and barefoot with buttocks uncovered,
to the shame of Egypt. &quot;Then they will be dismayed and ashamed because of
Cush their hope and Egypt their boast. &quot;So the inhabitants of this
coastland will say in that day, 'Behold, such is our hope, where we fled for
help to be delivered from the king of Assyria; and we, how shall we
escape?'&quot;” (Isaiah 20:1-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jeremiah was another example in Jeremiah 16:2, Jeremiah
16:8, and Jeremiah 16:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You shall not take a wife for yourself nor have sons or
daughters in this place.&quot;” (Jeremiah 16:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Moreover you shall not go into a house of feasting to
sit with them to eat and drink.&quot;” (Jeremiah 16:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Then you are to say to them, 'It is because your
forefathers have forsaken Me,' declares the LORD, 'and have followed other gods
and served them and bowed down to them; but Me they have forsaken and have not
kept My law.” (Jeremiah 16:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Another example was Ezekiel in the role of the “watchman”
for Israel in Ezekiel 33:1-3. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And the word of the LORD came to me, saying, &quot;Son of man,
speak to the sons of your people and say to them, 'If I bring a sword upon a
land, and the people of the land take one man from among them and make him
their watchman, and he sees the sword coming upon the land and blows on the
trumpet and warns the people,” (Ezekiel 33:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Today, the spiritual leaders of the nation are the
communicators of Bible doctrine, the evangelist and the pastor-teacher. The evangelist
deals with the need in a crisis of conversion with the unbeliever. The
pastor-teacher deals with the national crisis by dealing with the believer’s need
for spiritual growth. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The routine man of the Old Testament was the Levitical priest.
Their function has been replaced today by various spiritual gifts other than
the two communication gifts mentioned above. Lev. 8; Lev. 9.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Church Age - the Pastor-Teacher </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Church Age, the man for a national crisis is the
pastor-teacher. 2 Tim. 2:3-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Suffer hardship with me, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. No
soldier in active service entangles himself in the affairs of everyday life, so
that he may please the one who enlisted him as a soldier.” (2 Timothy 2:3-4,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher must be oriented to the times in which
they live. In the Church Age, there will always be wars and rumors of wars. Only
in the Millennium will Jesus Christ bring world peace. Matt. 24:6; Isaiah 2:4</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You will be hearing of wars and rumors of wars. See that
you are not frightened, for those things must take place, but that is not yet
the end.” (Matthew 24:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He will judge between the nations, And will render
decisions for many peoples; And they will hammer their swords into plowshares
and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not lift up sword against
nation, And never again will they learn war.” (Isaiah 2:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mankind is controlled by their old sin natures. James
4:1-2. </p>

<p class=Verses>“What is the source of quarrels and conflicts among you? Is not
the source your pleasures that wage war in your members? You lust and do not
have; so you commit murder. You are envious and cannot obtain; so you fight and
quarrel. You do not have because you do not ask.” (James 4:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Rejection of the truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
causes divisions and conflict in families. Families in a time of apostacy
cannot unify a nation. Matt. 10:34-36.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Do not think that I came to bring peace on the earth; I
did not come to bring peace, but a sword. &quot;For I came to SET A MAN AGAINST
HIS FATHER, AND A DAUGHTER AGAINST HER MOTHER, AND A DAUGHTER-IN-LAW AGAINST
HER MOTHER-IN-LAW; and A MAN'S ENEMIES WILL BE THE MEMBERS OF HIS HOUSEHOLD.”
(Matthew 10:34-36, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher must know the difference between
killing and murder, lying and deceiving the enemy. In Exodus 20:13 in the King
James Version, “kill” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>רצח</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(râtsach) in the
Hebrew and means to murder. Later in the New American Standard Version of the
Bible, the word was corrected to be “murder.” </p>

<p class=Verses>“Thou shalt not kill.” (Exodus 20:13, KJV) </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You shall not murder.” (Exodus 20:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew word for “kill” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>נכה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(nâkâh) as used in Joshua 20:3 which describes
manslaughter rather than murder. Human life can be taken biblically in an act
of war like in Joshua’s generation and when a governmental authority
administers capital punishment like in Genesis 9:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“that the manslayer who kills any person unintentionally,
without premeditation, may flee there, and they shall become your refuge from
the avenger of blood.” (Joshua 20:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Whoever sheds man's blood, By man his blood shall be
shed, For in the image of God He made man.” (Genesis 9:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher must have an excellent mental attitude
with an emphasis on patience. A believer with a maturing edification complex of
the soul at 20 years old can enter into an excitingly responsible period of their
life. The battle is in the mind. For example, David against Goliath. Rom. 7:15;
Rom. 7:23; 1 Sam. 17:26; 1 Sam. 17:32; 1 Sam. 17:36. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For what I am doing, I do not understand; for I am not
practicing what I would like to do, but I am doing the very thing I hate.”
(Romans 7:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“but I see a different law in the members of my body, waging
war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin which
is in my members.” (Romans 7:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then David spoke to the men who were standing by him, saying,
&quot;What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and takes away
the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he
should taunt the armies of the living God?&quot;” (1 Samuel 17:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“David said to Saul, &quot;Let no man's heart fail on account
of him; your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.&quot;” (1 Samuel
17:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear; and
this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, since he has taunted
the armies of the living God.&quot;” (1 Samuel 17:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher must combat the three greatest
problems he faces in his ministry - fear, unbelief, and disrespect for
authority. 1 Sam. 17:8-11; 1 Sam. 17:22-24; 1 Sam. 17:33; Prov. 30:11-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel and said to them,
&quot;Why do you come out to draw up in battle array? Am I not the Philistine
and you servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves and let him come down to
me. &quot;If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will become your
servants; but if I prevail against him and kill him, then you shall become our
servants and serve us.&quot; Again the Philistine said, &quot;I defy the ranks
of Israel this day; give me a man that we may fight together.&quot; When Saul
and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and
greatly afraid.” (1 Samuel 17:8-11, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then David left his baggage in the care of the baggage keeper,
and ran to the battle line and entered in order to greet his brothers. As he
was talking with them, behold, the champion, the Philistine from Gath named
Goliath, was coming up from the army of the Philistines, and he spoke these
same words; and David heard them. When all the men of Israel saw the man, they
fled from him and were greatly afraid.” (1 Samuel 17:22-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Saul said to David, &quot;You are not able to go against
this Philistine to fight with him; for you are but a youth while he has been a
warrior from his youth.&quot;” (1 Samuel 17:33, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“There is a kind of man whose teeth are like swords And his jaw
teeth like knives, To devour the afflicted from the earth And the needy from
among men. The leech has two daughters, &quot;Give,&quot; &quot;Give.&quot;
There are three things that will not be satisfied, Four that will not say,
&quot;Enough&quot;: Sheol, and the barren womb, Earth that is never satisfied
with water, And fire that never says, &quot;Enough.&quot; The eye that mocks a
father And scorns a mother, The ravens of the valley will pick it out, And the
young eagles will eat it.” (Proverbs 30:14-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher must stay positive to Bible doctrine
throughout his ministry. The parable of the great banquet in Luke 9:16-35
speaks of feeding on the Word of God due to positive volition. Not all will
respond to Bible doctrine being taught categorically. For those who do respond
with positive volition, the results are spiritual maturing and endurance of
soul. This endurance results in a preserving effect in the nation. The strategy
of consistent positive volition is also winning in the Angelic Conflict.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher must be taught in order to learn and
to teach. In 2 Timothy 2:2, there are four verbs of interest here. “Heard” is
the aorist active indicative of <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>κου</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (akouō) with the emphasis on hearing, not reading. “Entrust”
is the aorist middle imperative of <span lang=EL>παρατι</span>́<span lang=EL>θημι</span>
(paratithēmi) and means to place alongside, to deposit, to entrust, to train
in accordance with the rules of the military, to prepare the gift of the
individual.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The things which you have heard from me in the presence of
many witnesses, entrust these to faithful men who will be able to teach others
also.”  (2 Timothy 2:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Timothy 2:2, “will be” is future middle indicative
of <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓́<span lang=EL>σομαι</span> (esomai) and refers to
the teaching of those taught and is always future regarding their training.
“Teach” is the aorist active infinitive of <span lang=EL>διδα</span>́<span
lang=EL>σκω</span> (didaskō). The infinitive expresses that the purpose of the
instruction is that the ones taught may teach one day “others also.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher must develop a toughness that endures
the best the enemy can muster. In 2 Timothy 2:3, the verb for “suffer” is the
aorist active imperative of <span lang=EL>συγκακοπαθε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(sugkakopatheō) and means to suffer evil. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Suffer hardship with me, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.” 
(2 Timothy 2:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher must develop a rigid discipline in
regard to the details of life. In 2 Timothy 2:4, “soldier in active service” is
<span lang=EL>στρατευ</span>́<span lang=EL>ομαι</span> (strateuomai) and means
to do military duty, be in active service, be a soldier, to fight in battle.
“Entangles himself in the affairs of everyday life” is <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span
lang=EL>μπλε</span>́<span lang=EL>κω</span> (emplekō) and means to receive
entanglement, to get caught in a web of details such as finances etc. “So that
he may please” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>ρε</span>́<span lang=EL>σκω</span>
(areskō) and means to strive to please. Being a subjunctive, it is potentially
possible. “The one who enlisted him as a soldier” is <span lang=EL>στρατολογε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (stratologeō) and means to name, or call as a soldier and
refers to the soldier’s commander.</p>

<p class=Verses>“No soldier in active service entangles himself in the affairs
of everyday life, so that he may please the one who enlisted him as a soldier.” 
(2 Timothy 2:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher must exhibit progress, performance,
and competitive ability in the Angelic Conflict. In 2 Timothy 2:5, “if anyone
competes as an athlete” is <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>α</span>́<span
lang=EL>ν</span> (ean) plus the present active subjunctive of <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span
lang=EL>θλε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (athleō) where “if” is a third class
condition and means maybe he will, maybe he won’t. <i>Athleō</i> was the word
to contend in games, to wrestle in a contest. This refers the Angelic Conflict.
This is where you get the vocabulary to teach. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Also if anyone competes as an athlete, he does not win the
prize unless he competes according to the rules.”  (2 Timothy 2:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 9:24, “those who run in a race” refers
to all believers who are running in a race in the Angelic Conflict in the
spiritual life. “Receives the prize” is <span lang=EL>βραβει</span>͂<span
lang=EL>ον</span> (brabeion) and refers to an umpire who decides, arbitrates,
and rules! This umpire is none other than the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but only
one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may win.” (1 Corinthians
9:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 9:25, “competes” is the present middle
participle of <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>γωνι</span>́<span lang=EL>ζομαι</span>
(agōnizomai) and means to strive, to contend with adversaries, to fight, to
struggle with difficulties and dangers, to endeavor with strenuous zeal to
obtain something. The principle is that you compete to win. “Exercises
self-control” is the present middle indicative of <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span
lang=EL>γκρατευ</span>́<span lang=EL>ομαι</span> (egkrateuomai) and means to be
disciplined, to have self-control. This is the inner strength to put yourself
under rigorous discipline.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Everyone who competes in the games exercises self-control in
all things. They then do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an
imperishable.” (1 Corinthians 9:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 9:26, “not without aim” is <span
lang=EL>ουκ</span><span lang=EL> </span><span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>δη</span>́<span
lang=EL>λως</span> (ouk adēlōs) and is the strongest Greek negative when used
with a negative word, the negative alpha being there. It denotes blindness,
indistinct or uncertain eyesight, in other words, “Don’t run blind.” The
terrific pressure of the Angelic Conflict causes aberrations, etc. like
Pentecostalism.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore I run in such a way, as not without aim; I box in
such a way, as not beating the air;” (1 Corinthians 9:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“I box” is <span lang=EL>πυκτε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(pukteō) and means a boxer, a pugilist. I punch where it counts! “Not beating
the air” is <span lang=EL>δε</span>́<span lang=EL>ρω</span> (derō) and means
to flay, to skin, to beat, to thrash, to smite. It means a violent blow, a
thrashing about activity like a whirlwind. This is the punch of a mature
believer, not the punch of a shadow boxer.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In l Corinthians 9:27, “I discipline” is the present
active indicative of <span lang=EL>υ</span>̔<span lang=EL>πωπια</span>́<span
lang=EL>ζω</span> (hupōpiazō) and means a blow on the face, the part of the
face below the eyes. It means to strike under the eye, to give a black eye, to
wear out, to buffet, to bruise. This is severe self-discipline. This was a way
of life to him! “Make it my slave” is the present active indicative of <span
lang=EL>δουλαγωγε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (doulagōgeō) and means to
make a slave, to bring or lead a slave, to labor in slavery. It is stronger
than hupotasso or upakouo. It means to give the body no rights. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“I have preached” is <span lang=EL>κηρυ</span>́<span
lang=EL>σσω</span> (kērussō) and refers to the proclamation of a king, with
full authority. “I myself will not be” is the aorist middle subjunctive of <span
lang=EL>γι</span>́<span lang=EL>νομαι</span> (ginomai) and means he might
become something he was not before, a dropout, a failure. “Disqualified” is <span
lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>δο</span>́<span lang=EL>κιμος</span> (adokimos)
and means not standing the test, to be rejected, to be disqualified, to fail
the test. </p>

<p class=Verses>“but I discipline my body and make it my slave, so that, after
I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified.” (1 Corinthians
9:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher must be prepared to live in the face
of death. There are four possible reasons why soldiers die in war, to glorify
the Lord, their work on earth is finished, the sin unto death, or suicide. Job
5:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;In famine He will redeem you from death, And in war from
the power of the sword.” (Job 5:20, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Stability Illustrated by Salt and Light Principles</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The number of born-again believers living in a nation does
not guarantee the deliverance of a nation. The majority of them may be carnal
and result in divine discipline to the negative nation. Alternatively, a nation
is delivered and prospered if there is a high number of maturing believers
positive to Bible doctrine that live in the nation. The maturing believers
receive blessings from God and the nation receives them by association.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The unseen preservative of the nation is the pastor-teacher
studying and teaching daily and believers functioning and maturing daily via
the grace apparatus for perception and the filling of the Holy Spirit. The congregations
of local churches take in Bible doctrine through the privacy of their believer priesthood.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 5:13, “salt” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̔́<span
lang=EL>λας</span> (halas) in the Greek and refers to the use of salt as a
preservative and by analogy refers to the preservative effect brought to a
nation from the <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the souls of believers. Salt
is Bible doctrine with regard to the divine institutions. Salt is Bible
doctrine in the souls of believers enduring by consistent positive volition to
the intake and application of Bible doctrine. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt has
become tasteless, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for
anything, except to be thrown out and trampled under foot by men.” (Matthew
5:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“But if the salt has become tasteless” is the aorist
passive subjunctive of <span lang=EL>μωραι</span>́<span lang=EL>νω</span>
(mōrainō) and refers to salt that has lost its strength and flavor. By
analogy, this refers to believers with negative volition cease to be a
stabilizing or preservative of the nation. Believers negative to Bible doctrine
rob the Word of God of its potential power. Instead of salt flavor, they are insipid,
there is no flavor, they are tasteless! They are good for nothing and have no
spiritual ability for anything. A believer out of fellowship is not filled with
the Spirit and has no divine ability but filled with human ability. “Trampled
under foot” refers to the continuation of divine discipline.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 5:14-16, light is <span lang=EL>φω</span>͂<span
lang=EL>ς</span> (phōs) in the Greek and refers to the illumination brought by
Bible doctrine. God from the essence standpoint is light. The positive volition
principle of salt is that enduring leads to the positive volition principle of
light that leads to glorifying God. The edification complex of the soul in
maturing believers becomes a light house of the applied Word of God. Once the
light house in the soul is erected, it should continue to shine. A local church
with believers like this has impact and a positive testimony.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill
cannot be hidden; nor does anyone light a lamp and put it under a basket, but
on the lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house. &quot;Let
your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works,
and glorify your Father who is in heaven.” (Matthew 5:14-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 8:12, we are commanded to follow Jesus Christ who
is the Light of the world. Believers are commanded to reflect of the glory of
God in their spiritual life in the devil’s world. A lamp under a basket is the
believer out of fellowship or with little <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in
the right lobe of their soul. We are not on this earth to contribute darkness
to a world of darkness, but to be a light to the world. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Jesus again spoke to them, saying, &quot;I am the Light
of the world; he who follows Me will not walk in the darkness, but will have
the Light of life.&quot;” (John 8:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 5:16, “Let your light shine” is a command to build
an edification complex in the soul, to grow spiritually. This means consistent
daily study of Bible doctrine, function under the grace apparatus for
perception, and the erection of the edification complex. “Good works” is the production
of divine good while filled with the Holy Spirit. </p>
