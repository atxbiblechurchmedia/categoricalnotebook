<h2>Nature</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Nature is the physical world in its entirety that
surrounds us including everything in it not made by mankind (plants, animals,
mountains, oceans, stars, etc.) including its phenomena and the natural forces
and processes that produce and control these phenomena.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The present status of nature is described in Romans 8:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but
because of Him who subjected it, in hope”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 8:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Nature was originally good and not subject to
uselessness. Gen. 1-2. Sin destroyed that which was good. Gen. 3. Any good that
comes from nature today comes through man’s work. Gen. 3:17-19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then to Adam He said, “Because you have listened to the voice
of your wife, and have eaten from the tree about which I commanded you, saying,
‘You shall not eat from it’; Cursed is the ground because of you; In toil you
will eat of it All the days of your life. “Both thorns and thistles it shall
grow for you; And you will eat the plants of the field; By the sweat of your
face You will eat bread, Till you return to the ground, Because from it you
were taken; For you are dust, And to dust you shall return.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis
3:17-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This situation that nature can be advantageous does not
exist because of the desires of nature, but because God brought it to pass so
that the subjugation of nature would be compatible with the fallen state of
man. It is advantageous for man to be occupied with work! Thus Adam was to have
dominion over nature, but by the Fall, nature was cursed.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the Second Advent of Jesus Christ, the last Adam will
bring peace to nature. The hope of nature (creation) is the Second Advent when
the earth will be made compatible with man on earth. Only regenerate (believers)
will enter the Millennium. Rom. 8:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“that the creation itself also will be set free from its
slavery to corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
8:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the Rapture of the Church, there will be no change in
nature. At the Second Advent, Jesus Christ will cause significant changes to take
place. Isaiah 11:6-9; Isaiah 35:1-2; Isaiah 35:7; Isaiah 65:25. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And the wolf will dwell with the lamb, And the leopard will
lie down with the young goat, And the calf and the young lion and the fatling
together; And a little boy will lead them. Also the cow and the bear will
graze, Their young will lie down together, And the lion will eat straw like the
ox. The nursing child will play by the hole of the cobra, And the weaned child
will put his hand on the viper’s den. They will not hurt or destroy in all My
holy mountain, For the earth will be full of the knowledge of the LORD As the
waters cover the sea.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah 11:6-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The wilderness and the desert will be glad, And the Arabah
will rejoice and blossom; Like the crocus It will blossom profusely And rejoice
with rejoicing and shout of joy. The glory of Lebanon will be given to it, The
majesty of Carmel and Sharon. They will see the glory of the LORD, The majesty
of our God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah 35:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The scorched land will become a pool And the thirsty ground
springs of water; In the haunt of jackals, its resting place, Grass becomes
reeds and rushes.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah 35:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““The wolf and the lamb will graze together, and the lion will
eat straw like the ox; and dust will be the serpent’s food. They will do no
evil or harm in all My holy mountain,” says the LORD.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah
65:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>However, earth will be at its highest glory in eternity. This
will be the ultimate glory of the Palestinian Covenant. In that covenant, land
was promised to the seed of Abraham (Israel) forever. Rev. 21:1; Gen. 17:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven
and the first earth passed away, and there is no longer any sea.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation
21:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““I will give to you and to your descendants after you, the
land of your sojournings, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting
possession; and I will be their God.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis 17:8, NASB)</p>
