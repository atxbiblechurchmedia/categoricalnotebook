<h2><a name="_D-Old_Age"></a>Occupation with Jesus Christ</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One of the greatest components of the spiritual life is
occupation with the person of Christ. Being occupied with Christ is the
believer, filled with the Holy Spirit, functioning daily under the grace
apparatus for perception, and thus erecting the edification complex of the
soul. Occupation with Christ is a predisposition of the mind that sees all of
life from divine viewpoint, therefore, thinking with the mind of Christ. 1 Cor.
2:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT
HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.” (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>With consistent divine viewpoint thinking, the believer
can handle the most severe pressures and difficulties in life much like our
Lord did while on earth. It is wonderful to realize that we can enter into a
personal love relationship with God. Believers can achieve this spiritually
mature status by maintaining our filling of the Holy Spirit, learning the Word
of God on a daily basis, and applying the believed Bible doctrine to our lives.
The result is consistent spiritual growth. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Occupation with Christ is realized in the believer’s
thinking after their spiritual growth has developed a personal love for God and
an unconditional mental attitude <i>agapao</i> love for all that you meet in
life whether friendly or unfriendly. Occupation with Christ is the standard
operating procedure for the Christian life. Heb. 12:1-2. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses
surrounding us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so
easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before
us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the
joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at
the right hand of the throne of God.” (Hebrews 12:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Remember, all functions available to the Church Age
believer within the spiritual life are provided by God the Holy Spirit. They
are all purely grace functions all the way! Heb. 12:2-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith,
who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has
sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. For consider Him who has
endured such hostility by sinners against Himself, so that you will not grow
weary and lose heart.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 12:2-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What destroys being occupied with Christ in the believer?
Mental attitude sins. Mental attitude sins cause the believer to be out of
fellowship and operating under the control of the old sin nature. While in a
state of sin, the believer’s thoughts are not made captive to the obedience of
Christ. 2 Cor. 10:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“We are destroying speculations and every lofty thing raised up
against the knowledge of God, and we are taking every thought captive to the
obedience of Christ,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Corinthians 10:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mental attitude sins, sins of the tongue, and overt sin
will tell you that you are not occupied with Christ. Prov. 6:16-19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“There are six things which the LORD hates, Yes, seven which
are an abomination to Him: Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, And hands that shed
innocent blood, A heart that devises wicked plans, Feet that run rapidly to
evil, A false witness who utters lies, And one who spreads strife among
brothers.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 6:16-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>These can involve self-pity, eyes on self, eyes on
people, materialism lust, etc. Four techniques that contribute to occupation
with Christ are confession of known sins to God the Father, the resulting filling
of the Holy Spirit, faith-rest, and living in the Word with daily function
under the grace apparatus for perception. 1 John 1:9; Eph. 5:18; Heb. 4:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
John 1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but
be filled with the Spirit,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses> “Therefore, let us fear if, while a promise remains of
entering His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short of it. For indeed
we have had good news preached to us, just as they also; but the word they
heard did not profit them, because it was not united by faith in those who
heard.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 4:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Basis For Occupation with Jesus Christ </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The basis for occupation with Lord Jesus Christ is Bible
doctrine through the daily function of the grace apparatus for perception. Heb.
3:13-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But encourage one another day after day, as long as it is
still called &quot;Today,&quot; so that none of you will be hardened by the
deceitfulness of sin. For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast
the beginning of our assurance firm until the end,” (Hebrews 3:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Even the spiritual babe in Christ gets a taste of
occupation with Christ with spiritual growth bringing ever more time occupied
with Him. Only the mature believer appreciates Christ fully. Why? The mature
believer has more capacity. 1 Peter 2:2-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“like newborn babies, long for the pure milk of the word, so
that by it you may grow in respect to salvation, if you have tasted the
kindness of the Lord.” (1 Peter 2:2-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Occupation with Christ is thinking the same thoughts that
Jesus Christ thought while on earth in prosperity and under even extreme
pressure. It is thinking divine viewpoint. Isaiah 55:8; 1 Cor. 2:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For My thoughts are not your thoughts, Nor are your ways
My ways,&quot; declares the LORD.” (Isaiah 55:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT
HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.” (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Occupation with Christ is actually the rapport love
response of the maturing believer in their fellowship with the Lord Jesus
Christ. Occupation with Christ gives stability of mental attitude love. 2 Tim.
3:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“treacherous, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather
than lovers of God,” (2 Timothy 3:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Lord allots certain amounts of time for the believer
in the spiritual life. Time for sleep, to eat, to work, to play, vacation, to
rest and relax. He also provides a certain amount of for suffering and
pressures and time to be alone! For example, military service involves
separation from loved ones. A man going to work involves separation from his
wife. Confession of sin is done alone. God gives one mind, not two in one body,
and so on!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>David was alone in the cave of Adullam. This had become
his headquarters for possibly as long as a year. From there he went to the
forest of Hereth. In the meantime, before his parents and brothers arrived and
the 400 malcontents got there, he was alone. He was alone with Jesus Christ.
The greatest answer to loneliness is occupation with Jesus Christ. 1 Sam. 22:1;
1 Sam. 22:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So David departed from there and escaped to the cave of
Adullam; and when his brothers and all his father's household heard of it, they
went down there to him.” (1 Samuel 22:1, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“The prophet Gad said to David, &quot;Do not stay in the
stronghold; depart, and go into the land of Judah.&quot; So David departed and
went into the forest of Hereth.” (1 Samuel 22:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Occupation with Christ is concentration on His thinking
and thinking the same thoughts under pressure and prosperity. What you are
thinking and what you are saying are often two different things. What you are
thinking is really what you are. Occupation with the person of Jesus Christ is
built on the concept of correct biblical thinking, divine viewpoint. Phil.
2:5-8; Prov. 23:7.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ
Jesus, who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality
with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a
bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men. Being found in appearance
as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even
death on a cross.” (Philippians 2:5-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For as he thinks within himself, so he is. He says to
you, &quot;Eat and drink!&quot; But his heart is not with you.&quot;  (Proverbs
23:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are two ways of thinking, divine viewpoint and
human viewpoint. The thinking of God is different from that of man’s thinking.
The thinking of God is greater than the thinking of man. The thinking of man
gets its direction and expression from the old sin nature. Occupation with
Jesus Christ is built not only on the concept of thinking, but is a certain
method of thinking which is in harmony with God’s thoughts. Isaiah 55:7-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Let the wicked forsake his way And the unrighteous man
his thoughts; And let him return to the LORD, And He will have compassion on
him, And to our God, For He will abundantly pardon. &quot;For My thoughts are
not your thoughts, Nor are your ways My ways,&quot; declares the LORD.
&quot;For as the heavens are higher than the earth, So are My ways higher than
your ways And My thoughts than your thoughts.&quot;  (Isaiah 55:7-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Word of God is the umpire or the official in the
battle of human viewpoint vs. divine viewpoint. The Word of God serves as a
critic of man’s thinking. It accuses it, limits it, categorizes it, and
condemns it. The Word of God gets to the source of man’s thinking, the real
issue, their motivations. If one is to have soul stability, you must learn to express
your own thoughts that line up with God’s thoughts. Heb. 4:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For the word of God is living and active and sharper than
any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of
both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the
heart.&quot;  (Hebrews 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Occupation with Christ is the only antidote against
overthinking everything. Complaining, murmuring and disputes break your
concentration on Jesus Christ. Phil. 2:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do all things without grumbling or disputing;” (Philippians
2:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Occupation with Jesus Christ or thinking divine viewpoint
enables the babe to use the newly acquired truths learned in the babe stage to
relate his thinking to life and God’s view of it. Before the babe is able to
handle service for Christ, he must begin by learning that the mental attitude
and thought pattern is the vital issue all throughout his life and service.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Four Components of the Spiritual Life That Contribute
to Occupation with Christ</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The four components of the spiritual life that greatly
contribute to our occupation with the Lord Jesus Christ are; confession of
known sins to God the Father using 1 John 1:9, the filling of the Holy Spirit
(Eph. 5:18), the faith rest life, (Heb. 4:1-2), and understanding the
importance of divine truth and living daily within God's Word.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but
be filled with the Spirit,” (Ephesians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, let us fear if, while a promise remains of entering
His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short of it. For indeed we have
had good news preached to us, just as they also; but the word they heard did
not profit them, because it was not united by faith in those who heard.”
(Hebrews 4:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Occupation with the person of Christ constitutes a
pre-disposition of mind that sees all of life from divine viewpoint. This is
the great application of keeping our eyes on the Lord and not self,
circumstances, things, and definitely not other people! </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Believer’s Greatest Enemy in Developing Personal
Love Toward God</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The greatest enemy keeping the believer from developing a
personal love relationship toward God the Father and resulting occupation with
Jesus Christ is mental attitude sin. These mental attitude sins are the result
of living our lives out of fellowship with God and functioning under the
control of the old sin nature. This old sin nature control of the soul
frustrates any spiritual thoughts. 2 Cor. 10:5. </p>

<p class=Verses>“We are destroying speculations and every lofty thing raised up
against the knowledge of God, and we are taking every thought captive to the
obedience of Christ,” (2 Corinthians 10:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The three ways we can tell when we are not occupied with
Christ are gleaned from Proverbs 6:16-19. These three ways are the sins of the
mind, the sins of the tongue, and various sins of overt behavior. The greatest
enemy is the sins of the mind which can involve self-pity, having our eyes on
arrogant self, having our eyes on others, and being motivated from the lust
pattern of the old sin nature. </p>

<p class=Verses>“There are six things which the LORD hates, Yes, seven which
are an abomination to Him: Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, And hands that shed
innocent blood, A heart that devises wicked plans, Feet that run rapidly to
evil, A false witness who utters lies, And one who spreads strife among
brothers.” (Proverbs 6:16-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Christian’s Highest Spiritual Function </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Occupation with Jesus Christ is much more important than
loving people, dogs, cats, or good scenery. It is based on motivational virtue
of a personal love relationship with God under which the maturing believer,
with <i>epignosis</i> Bible truth in the right lobe of the soul, is capable of
appreciating, respecting, and loving the Lord Jesus Christ. Since our Lord is
the only manifest person of the Godhead, occupation with Him constitutes
maximum love toward the second person of the Trinity. Therefore, occupation with
Christ is the maximum expression of personal love toward God. Deut. 6:5.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and
with all your soul and with all your might.” (Deuteronomy 6:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Maximum Bible doctrine resident in our souls gives each
of us the capacity for love in many directions. Once you begin to know the Lord
Jesus Christ through His word, you begin to love Him, and in turn, you develop
the capacity to love others. Occupation with Christ reaches a maximum when the
Christian becomes spiritually mature. Col. 3:16-17. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Let the word of Christ richly dwell within you, with all
wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual
songs, singing with thankfulness in your hearts to God. Whatever you do in word
or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks through Him to God
the Father.” (Colossians 3:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Occupation with Christ glorifies the Lord Jesus Christ.
The mature Christian glorifies God through their personal love relationship
with Him. The personal love for God surpasses all knowledge and causes us to be
occupied with Jesus Christ. Col 3:1-2; Eph. 3:19-21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore if you have been raised up with Christ, keep seeking
the things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your
mind on the things above, not on the things that are on earth.” (Colossians
3:1-2, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that
you may be filled up to all the fullness of God. Now to Him who is able to do
far more abundantly beyond all that we ask or think, according to the power
that works within us, to Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to
all generations forever and ever. Amen.” (Ephesians 3:19-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ephesians 3:21, “to all generations, forever and ever”
means that in every generation of the Church Age, some spiritually mature
believer is occupied with Christ and that honors and glorifies God. If you
become a mature believer and keep on growing in the spiritual life, this
personal love relationship which glorifies Christ will go on forever and ever.
You will then glorify Him to the maximum through the blessings and rewards of
eternity. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The means of occupation with Christ is the daily intake,
residency, and application of Bible truth. Consistency in the intake of the
Word of God produces occupation with Jesus Christ and resultant spiritual
maturity. This result is from the grace of God, not from the believer’s
abilities.  Any boasting should be because of God’s grace resources provided as
part of His grace plan for each and every one of us. He has caused us to
understand His plan for us through His grace only. Jer. 9:23-24; Eph. 3:18-19;
Eph. 4:20. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Thus says the LORD, &quot;Let not a wise man boast of his
wisdom, and let not the mighty man boast of his might, let not a rich man boast
of his riches; but let him who boasts boast of this, that he understands and
knows Me, that I am the LORD who exercises lovingkindness, justice and
righteousness on earth; for I delight in these things,&quot; declares the
LORD.” (Jeremiah 9:23-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the
breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ which
surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God.”
(Ephesians 3:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But you did not learn Christ in this way,” (Ephesians 4:20,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Occupation with Christ eliminates the superficialities of
human celebrityship. Phil. 3:7-8. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But whatever things were gain to me, those things I have
counted as loss for the sake of Christ. More than that, I count all things to
be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for
whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish so that
I may gain Christ,” (Philippians 3:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In each dispensation, there are many heroes but just one
celebrity, the God-man, Jesus Christ. The celebrityship of Jesus Christ is one
of the great subjects in the prison epistles! Eph. 1:22-23; Eph. 5:23; Eph.
2:16; Eph. 4:4-5; Col. 1:18; Col. 1:24; Col. 2:19. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And He put all things in subjection under His feet, and gave
Him as head over all things to the church, which is His body, the fullness of
Him who fills all in all.” (Ephesians 1:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the
head of the church, He Himself being the Savior of the body.” (Ephesians 5:23,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“There is one body and one Spirit, just as also you were called
in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism,” (Ephesians
4:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh
I do my share on behalf of His body, which is the church, in filling up what is
lacking in Christ's afflictions.” (Colossians 1:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and not holding fast to the head, from whom the entire body,
being supplied and held together by the joints and ligaments, grows with a
growth which is from God.” (Colossians 2:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Occupation with Christ is the basis for blessing in
suffering and can minimize the suffering. Reversionism intensifies suffering
under divine discipline. Psalms 77; 2 Cor. 12:9-10. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And He has said to me, &quot;My grace is sufficient for you,
for power is perfected in weakness.&quot; Most gladly, therefore, I will rather
boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me.
Therefore I am well content with weaknesses, with insults, with distresses,
with persecutions, with difficulties, for Christ's sake; for when I am weak,
then I am strong.” (2 Corinthians 12:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Occupation with Christ also motivates the pastor-teacher
to keep teaching Bible doctrine so the congregation can grow and reach
occupation with Christ themselves. Heb. 6:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For God is not unjust so as to forget your work and the love
which you have shown toward His name, in having ministered and in still
ministering to the saints.” (Hebrews 6:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The intake and application of Bible doctrine produces the
dynamics of occupation with Christ as the believer grows into spiritual
maturity. James 1:19-20; Heb. 3:1-2; Heb. 3:6. </p>

<p class=Verses>“This you know, my beloved brethren. But everyone must be quick
to hear, slow to speak and slow to anger; for the anger of man does not achieve
the righteousness of God.” (James 1:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling,
consider Jesus, the Apostle and High Priest of our confession; He was faithful
to Him who appointed Him, as Moses also was in all His house.” (Hebrews 3:1-2,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“but Christ was faithful as a Son over His house—whose house we
are, if we hold fast our confidence and the boast of our hope firm until the
end.” (Hebrews 3:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The function of the grace apparatus for perception
through the filling of the Holy Spirit is the believer responding to the love
of Jesus Christ. God reveals His love to the believer through Bible doctrine.
The pastor-teacher demonstrates his love for his congregation by teaching them
Bible doctrine. James 1:21-24.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, putting aside all filthiness and all that remains
of wickedness, in humility receive the word implanted, which is able to save
your souls. But prove yourselves doers of the word, and not merely hearers who
delude themselves.” (James 1:21-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is
like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror; for once he has looked at
himself and gone away, he has immediately forgotten what kind of person he
was.” (James 1:23-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>With Bible doctrine as the working object of faith, the
believer has maximum personal <i>phileo</i> love response causing him to be
designated a friend of God. James 2:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, &quot;AND ABRAHAM
BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS RECKONED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS,&quot; and he was
called the friend of God.” (James 2:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Personal love for God or occupation with Christ is
illustrated in the husband-wife relationship. Husbands should have
self-sacrificing lives and husband and wife should have love for each other -
not self-centeredness or what each can get from the relationship. Eph. 5:22-33;
1 Cor. 11:7.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the
head of the church, He Himself being the Savior of the body. But as the church
is subject to Christ, so also the wives ought to be to their husbands in
everything.” (Ephesians 5:23-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own
bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself;” (Ephesians 5:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Nevertheless, each individual among you also is to love his
own wife even as himself, and the wife must see to it that she respects her
husband.” (Ephesians 5:33, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Occupation with Christ is related to the victory in the
Angelic Conflict. Col. 3:1-2. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore if you have been raised up with Christ, keep seeking
the things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your
mind on the things above, not on the things that are on earth.” (Colossians
3:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For a man ought not to have his head covered, since he is the
image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man.” (1 Corinthians
11:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Occupation With The Head of The Body of Christ</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Colossians 2:19, “holding fast” is the negative οὐ
(ou) plus the present active participle of <span lang=EL>κρατε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (krateō) and means to seize, to apprehend, to be occupied
with someone or something which belongs to self. “The head” is <span lang=EL>κεφαλη</span>́
(kephalē) in the Greek and is the term refers to absolute sovereignty. It is
used for the human head, but in Greek literature it refers to the ruler, the
chief, the principle one to whom all are subordinate. It also connotes the
concept of celebrityship and reminds us that the Lord Jesus Christ is the only
celebrity in the Church Age.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and not holding fast to the head, from whom the entire body,
being supplied and held together by the joints and ligaments, grows with a
growth which is from God.” (Colossians 2:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Not being occupied with the Head or Jesus Christ is the
great problem in the spiritual life. The failure to develop a personal love
response to God is because the believer has failed to consistently learn and
apply Bible doctrine. Hence, they have not grown spiritually and do not have
the capacity to love God because of their lack of understanding of who God is
and what He has done in grace for every believer. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They do not witness to the unbeliever, they have no
prayer life, and therefore cannot be of service to the Lord. The basic
principle is that the intake of Bible doctrine leads to spiritual growth which
results in a capacity to love the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Colossians 2:19, “from whom” is the preposition <span
lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>κ</span> (ek) plus the relative pronoun <span
lang=EL>ο</span>̔́<span lang=EL>ς</span> (hos) and refers to Jesus Christ, the
Head of the Church. “The entire body” refers to all Church Age believers. This
is part of the grace principle when Jesus Christ was hanging on the Cross
alone, all alone. And when this happened, God said, “It is not good that the
Last Adam be alone.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A bride always has a body. Christ was appointed the high
priest and a high priest needs to be over priests. The priesthood is based on
spiritual rebirth. “Bride” is the designation in resurrection. There must be
love between the bride and bridegroom. The courtship is going on now and will
continue until the Rapture of the Church! You must recognize the celebrityship
of Christ. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“By the joints and ligaments” is the preposition <span
lang=EL>δια</span>́ (dia) plus genitive plural of <span lang=EL>α</span>̔<span
lang=EL>φη</span>́ (haphē) and the genitive plural of <span lang=EL>συ</span>́<span
lang=EL>νδεσμος</span> (sundesmos) and means to fasten, something that fastens
one member of the body with another.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Joints and ligaments connect members of the body
providing symmetry. Symmetry is determined by major joint functions of the
body. Joints and ligaments become analogous to Bible doctrine in the right lobe
of the soul. Every part of the body has a different function, but joints and
ligaments link them all together. What links together all personalities,
nationalities? Bible doctrine! </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Not only do they connect, but they build strength. The
daily intake of Bible doctrine builds spiritual strength. They provide body
coordination and action. In sports, everything calls for action of joints and
ligaments. The greatest occupational hazard for the football player is to have
trouble with the knee joint and ligaments in the knees and so on. Eph. 4:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by
what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual
part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love.”
(Ephesians 4:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Colossians 2:19, “being supplied” is two participles,
one of which is the present passive participle of <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span
lang=EL>πιχορηγε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (epichorēgeō). This is a word
from Greek drama where someone finances the drama production and supplies the
money to dress the chorus in the drama. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Held together” is the present passive participle of <span
lang=EL>συμβιβα</span>́<span lang=EL>ζω</span> (sumbibazō) and means to unite,
to infer, to conclude, and being taught through the pastor-teacher. “Grows”
present active indicative of <span lang=EL>αυ</span>̓<span lang=EL>ξα</span>́<span
lang=EL>νω</span> (auxanō) and means keeps on growing. “From God” is the
ablative with <span lang=EL>θεο</span>́<span lang=EL>ς</span> (theos) and means
from the source of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The corrected translation of Colossians 2:19 is, “And not
occupied with the Head (Christ) from whom all the body through joints and
ligaments (doctrine) being supplied and being taught keeps on growing (the body
keeps on growing) with the growth from the source of God.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Characteristics of the Maturing Believer </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Characteristics are listed below that the believer will
exhibit when they approach spiritual maturity where maximum occupation with
Christ occurs. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Occupation with Christ is very thinking of Jesus Christ
being formed in you. Gal. 4:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“My children, with whom I am again in labor until Christ is
formed in you—” (Galatians 4:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Occupation with Christ is the greatest motivator in life.
2 Cor. 5:14. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For the love of Christ controls us, having concluded this,
that one died for all, therefore all died;” (2 Corinthians 5:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The mature believer contributes to the blessings given
from God to his or her nation. Deut. 30:15-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;See, I have set before you today life and prosperity,
and death and adversity; in that I command you today to love the LORD your God,
to walk in His ways and to keep His commandments and His statutes and His
judgments, that you may live and multiply, and that the LORD your God may bless
you in the land where you are entering to possess it. &quot;But if your heart
turns away and you will not obey, but are drawn away and worship other gods and
serve them,” (Deuteronomy 30:15-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Occupation with Christ produces combat courage and
victory in battle. Joshua 23:10-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;One of your men puts to flight a thousand, for the LORD
your God is He who fights for you, just as He promised you. &quot;So take
diligent heed to yourselves to love the LORD your God.” (Joshua 23:10-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Occupation with Christ is the basis for persevering
during testing. Psalms 31:23-24.</p>

<p class=Verses>“O love the LORD, all you His godly ones! The LORD preserves
the faithful And fully recompenses the proud doer. Be strong and let your heart
take courage, All you who hope in the LORD.” (Psalms 31:23-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Occupation with Christ is the basis for stability of
mentality and great inner happiness in the spiritual life. Psalms 16:8-9; Eph
3:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I have set the LORD continually before me; Because He is at my
right hand, I will not be shaken. Therefore my heart is glad and my glory
rejoices; My flesh also will dwell securely.” (Psalms 16:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; and
that you, being rooted and grounded in love,” (Ephesians 3:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The spiritual life is based on thinking not action.
Correct action and decision making is the result of correct thinking. The
emphasis in the spiritual life as the believer grows is thinking divine
viewpoint more of the time and human viewpoint less of the time. Phil. 2:5; 1
Cor. 2:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ
Jesus,” (Philippians 2:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT
HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.” (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Occupation with Christ is total dependence on God's grace
provision leading to spiritual maturity. Occupation with Christ also results in
developing the capacity for the grace blessings of spiritual maturity. Eph.
3:19; Psalms 37:4-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that
you may be filled up to all the fullness of God.” (Ephesians 3:19, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“Delight yourself in the LORD; And He will give you the desires
of your heart. Commit your way to the LORD, Trust also in Him, and He will do
it.” (Psalms 37:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Occupation with Christ is the basis for strength under
pressure. Heb. 11:27.</p>

<p class=Verses>“By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for
he endured, as seeing Him who is unseen.” (Hebrews 11:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Occupation with Christ frustrates soul weariness and
discouragement. Heb. 12:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For consider Him who has endured such hostility by sinners
against Himself, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.” (Hebrews
12:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Occupation with Christ is associated with sharing the
perfect happiness of God. 1 Peter 1:8. </p>

<p class=Verses>“and though you have not seen Him, you love Him, and though you
do not see Him now, but believe in Him, you greatly rejoice with joy
inexpressible and full of glory,” (1 Peter 1:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Dangers of Human Viewpoint Thinking</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Illustrations of Mental Attitude Thinking</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Worldliness: This is human viewpoint thinking. Rom. 12:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed
by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is,
that which is good and acceptable and perfect.&quot;  (Romans 12:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Peace: This is a resultant mental attitude of divine
viewpoint. Isaiah 26:3; Phil. 4:6-8.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;The steadfast of mind You will keep in perfect
peace, Because he trusts in You.&quot;  (Isaiah 26:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and
supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the
peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, will guard your hearts and
your minds in Christ Jesus. Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is
honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is
of good repute, if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise,
dwell on these things.&quot;  (Philippians 4:6-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Giving: This is a grace way of thinking. Divine viewpoint
is seen in contrast to human viewpoint. 2 Cor. 8. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Stability: Stability of life and practice is first
expressed as mental attitude stability. 1 Sam. 17:47.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and that all this assembly may know that the LORD does
not deliver by sword or by spear; for the battle is the LORD'S and He will give
you into our hands.&quot;&quot;  (1 Samuel 17:47, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Examples of Human Viewpoint Thinking</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Looking on things after the outward appearance. 2 Cor.
10:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;You are looking at things as they are outwardly. If
anyone is confident in himself that he is Christ's, let him consider this again
within himself, that just as he is Christ's, so also are we.&quot;  (2
Corinthians 10:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Wrongly evaluating leadership on human dynamics,
personality, appearance. 2 Cor. 10:8-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For even if I boast somewhat further about our authority,
which the Lord gave for building you up and not for destroying you, I will not
be put to shame, for I do not wish to seem as if I would terrify you by my
letters. For they say, &quot;His letters are weighty and strong, but his
personal presence is unimpressive and his speech contemptible.&quot;&quot;  (2
Corinthians 10:8-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Comparative success, spirituality by relativity.
Principle and practice of measuring the ministry of others. 2 Cor. 10:12-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For we are not bold to class or compare ourselves with
some of those who commend themselves; but when they measure themselves by
themselves and compare themselves with themselves, they are without
understanding. But we will not boast beyond our measure, but within the measure
of the sphere which God apportioned to us as a measure, to reach even as far as
you.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 10:12-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Principle of self-justification. These attitudes are
clearly set forth as having a human viewpoint origin. They are to be rejected
in thinking divine viewpoint. 2 Cor. 10:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For it is not he who commends himself that is approved,
but he whom the Lord commends.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 10:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Results of Thinking Divine Viewpoint</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mentally, divine viewpoint is the standard for life. This
is the ultimate thinking that the babe has to learn that includes the technique
of occupation with Jesus Christ or thinking divine viewpoint. Only with divine
viewpoint will giving the Gospel be effective. 2 Cor. 10:13-14. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But we will not boast beyond our measure, but within the
measure of the sphere which God apportioned to us as a measure, to reach even
as far as you. For we are not overextending ourselves, as if we did not reach
to you, for we were the first to come even as far as you in the gospel of
Christ;&quot;  (2 Corinthians 10:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Growth and development in the believer. Increased
missionary activity. 2 Cor. 10:15-16. Glorifying Him in our thinking.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;not boasting beyond our measure, that is, in other men's
labors, but with the hope that as your faith grows, we will be, within our
sphere, enlarged even more by you, so as to preach the gospel even to the
regions beyond you, and not to boast in what has been accomplished in the
sphere of another.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 10:15-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Concluding Principles</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To be occupied with Jesus Christ is to be occupied with
His Word. John 15. To be occupied with the Word means to have it expressed
through our thought process. To have the Word expressed in our thought process,
all human viewpoint must be excluded. To have human viewpoint excluded from our
daily lives, we must recognize and confess it, moving on in the spiritual life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>However, before one can recognize human viewpoint or
confess it, one must be taught from the Word of God what it is. Human viewpoint
information like the specific sins list is often times much too short. Things
that we accept readily as just our own idiosyncrasies are often sin or human
viewpoint.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The technique of occupation with Jesus Christ or thinking
divine viewpoint is dependent on other techniques such as confessing sin biblically,
the filling of the Spirit, the faith-rest life, and living in the Word. The
immediate source of occupation with Jesus Christ is the frame of reference in
the believer’s soul. It is the Word stored in the right lobe of the soul and
ready for application to life’s situations and decisions.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Thinking divine viewpoint in relation to the human
affairs of life allows the believer to constantly have God in focus and not
become sidetracked in the human things of life, or relegate God off to some
corner with a church sign over the doorway. Paul said, “For in Him we live and
move and exist.” Acts 17:28.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;for in Him we live and move and exist, as even some of
your own poets have said, 'For we also are His children.'&quot;  (Acts 17:28,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Human viewpoint attitudes restrict the communication of
the Word of God and require that the communicator be tough as indicated in 1
Corinthians 10:1-2. Human viewpoint systems of thought will not hold up as
methods of dealing with the forces of evil, nor survive in the Angelic Conflict.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For I do not want you to be unaware, brethren, that our
fathers were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea; and all were
baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea;&quot;  (1 Corinthians 10:1-2,
NASB)</p>
