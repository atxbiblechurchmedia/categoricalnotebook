<h2>Origin of Nations</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The tracing of racial groups is necessary for the
understanding of the origin of nations. Philology is the tracing of the origin
of nations through languages such as Indo-European (Japheth), Semitic (Shem),
and Terranean languages, (Ham), etc. Anthropology is the study of man himself,
his stature, his skull, his posture, and so on. Trichology is the study of
hair. Dermatology is the study of the skin. Genetics are studied as are
cultures and customs like burial customs. Then there is the National Index or the
settling of Japheth, Ham, and Shem linguistically and geographically. Gen. 10.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An understanding of the three prophesies of Genesis
9:24-27 is also necessary. Shem was the evangelizing one through whom Christ
came. Ham was the serving one. Japheth was the conquering one.</p>

<p class=Verses>“When Noah awoke from his wine, he knew what his youngest son
had done to him. So he said, &quot;Cursed be Canaan; A servant of servants He
shall be to his brothers.&quot; He also said, &quot;Blessed be the LORD, The
God of Shem; And let Canaan be his servant. &quot;May God enlarge Japheth, And
let him dwell in the tents of Shem; And let Canaan be his servant.&quot;”
(Genesis 9:24-27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Sons of Japheth </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The seven sons of Japheth are listed in Genesis 10:1-4. Gomer
was the father of the Celts, Teutons, Scythians (Irish, Scotch, Germans,
British, Norwegians, Swedes and so on). Magog was the father of the Slavic
peoples, the Scythians. Madai was the father of the Medes, some Persians, and
the Arians of India. Javan was the father of the Greeks and Romans. Tubal has
traditionally been identified with Russia and the Ukraine as Meshech and Tubal.
Tiras was the father of the Thracians and the Illyrians. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Now these are the records of the generations of Shem, Ham, and
Japheth, the sons of Noah; and sons were born to them after the flood. The sons
of Japheth were Gomer and Magog and Madai and Javan and Tubal and Meshech and
Tiras. The sons of Gomer were Ashkenaz and Riphath and Togarmah. The sons of
Javan were Elishah and Tarshish, Kittim and Dodanim.”  (Genesis 10:1-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Genesis 10:3-4 develops the sons of Gomer and Javan, the
most important descendants of the Japhetic groups.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The sons of Gomer were Ashkenaz and Riphath and Togarmah. The
sons of Javan were Elishah and Tarshish, Kittim and Dodanim.”  (Genesis 10:3-4,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 10:5, “into their lands” refers to
geographical division. “Every one according to his language” refers to linguistic
division. “According to their families” refers to racial division. “Into their
nations” refers to nationalistic division. Internationalism did not exist at
this time. </p>

<p class=Verses>“From these the coastlands of the nations were separated into
their lands, every one according to his language, according to their families,
into their nations.”  (Genesis 10:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Sons of Ham</b> </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 10:6, the four sons of Ham are listed. From
Cush came the Ethiopians and settled in the Southern part of Africa. The son of
Cush was Nimrod who was a world-wide dictator. The “mighty one” was like Cain
in that he was a killer of men. Nimrod was responsible for the first version of
the United Nations. Gen. 10:8-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The sons of Ham were Cush and Mizraim and Put and Canaan.” 
(Genesis 10:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now Cush became the father of Nimrod; he became a mighty one
on the earth. He was a mighty hunter before the LORD; therefore it is said,
&quot;Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before the LORD.&quot; The beginning of his
kingdom was Babel and Erech and Accad and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. From
that land he went forth into Assyria, and built Nineveh and Rehoboth-Ir and
Calah, and Resen between Nineveh and Calah; that is the great city.” (Genesis
10:8-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>From Mizraim came the Egyptians and Castrines. Some of Mizraim’s
descendants settled around the hills of Rome and in Central Italy. They
included the Philistines that gave Israel and David a bad time and Grecians,
but in the line of Ham. All were considered very fierce and warlike. Gen.
10:13-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Mizraim became the father of Ludim and Anamim and Lehabim and
Naphtuhim and Pathrusim and Casluhim (from which came the Philistines) and
Caphtorim.” (Genesis 10:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>From Put came those who settled in northern Africa and
gradually moved to the northern peninsulas of Spain, Italy, and Greece. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>From Canaan came the Canaanites, Amorites, and Hittites. Canaan’s
son Sidon was the father of all Phoenician peoples. Heth was the father of the
Hittites who were a very famous people. The Hittites are the basis for all
Mongolians and Chinese people. The Jebusite was that branch of the Hamite line
that settled around Jerusalem and were not conquered until David’s day. Until
David’s day, the Jews lived around Jerusalem, but not in Jerusalem until David
conquered. The Jews lived in Bethlehem, but not Jerusalem. Gen. 10:15-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Canaan became the father of Sidon, his firstborn, and Heth and
the Jebusite and the Amorite and the Girgashite and the Hivite and the Arkite
and the Sinite and the Arvadite and the Zemarite and the Hamathite; and
afterward the families of the Canaanite were spread abroad.” (Genesis 10:15-18,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Amorites were the mountaineers of the Canaanites and
lived in the mountains of Judah, Ephraim, Bashan, Gilead and so on. The Girgashites
were a branch of the Hivites, a branch who lived in Palestine. The Hivites were
the Canaanites who lived in Syria and another branch of these were the
Gibeonites of Joshua’s day.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Arkites were the North Phoenicians. The Sinites were
the Canaanites who lived in Lebanon. The Arvadites were also the North
Phoenicians. The Zemarites lived in Arvad and Hamath mentioned in Zechariah. The
Hamathites lived in the famous city of Hamath in the Lebanon area. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>These names are meaningless to you unless you have a
working knowledge of ancient history, but they are very meaningful and
important.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Geographical Location of the Canaanites</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Canaanites also have geographical, linguistic, racial,
and nationalistic divisions. But we know from the Word of God that the Jews
were to utterly drive the Canaanites from the Land. Why? Gen. 10:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The territory of the Canaanite extended from Sidon as you go
toward Gerar, as far as Gaza; as you go toward Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and
Zeboiim, as far as Lasha.” (Genesis 10:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><a name="_Destruction_of_the"></a><u>Destruction of the
Canaanites</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God indicated in Genesis 15:16 that at a future time the
“iniquity of the Amorites would be full.” This would be more than 400 years in
the future. Moses, in Deuteronomy 12, indicated that the time had come to
“utterly destroy” all the Canaanites. It was in the form of a command from God.
Deut. 12:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Then in the fourth generation they will return here, for
the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet complete.&quot;” (Genesis 15:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;These are the statutes and the judgments which you shall
carefully observe in the land which the LORD, the God of your fathers, has
given you to possess as long as you live on the earth. &quot;You shall utterly
destroy all the places where the nations whom you shall dispossess serve their
gods, on the high mountains and on the hills and under every green tree.”
(Deuteronomy 12:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Canaanites were to be removed for two reasons: religion
and degeneracy. The Canaanite religion involved a duplication of the Trinity.
They had El who was the supreme God of the Canaanites. This was an attempt by
Satan to reproduce God the Father. El’s primary purpose in life was to run
around and seduce all the women he could. He was highly praised for his
efforts.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>El had a son Baal who counterfeited the Lord Jesus
Christ. Baal gave rain for crops and fertility for procreation. In the Epic of
Ugarit, Baal had a fight with another God called Mot who was supposed to be
Satan. Mot was the god of death. In the struggle, Baal lost to Mot and died.
This was an attempt to duplicate the Cross, but Baal by dying was able to come
back to life again and this is why everything dying in the winter is able to
come back up in the spring, you see.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Baal had a sister by the name of Onus and she was able to
bring Baal back from the dead. This is an attempt to duplicate the Holy Spirit
as the Holy Spirit had a part in resurrecting Christ from the dead. This
Ugaritic literature was recovered through archeology and reads just like the
Bible, but substitutes these characters for the true Trinity. Along with this
religion, was the most horrible degeneracy possible. A god by the name of Zeus
and the goddess of love, sex, fertility was loose. Their lust led to terrible
degeneracy. Leviticus 18 and 20 and Deuteronomy 12 tell why.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Religion does not move into the direction of morality,
but immorality. Canaanites led the world in bestiality, homosexuality,
lesbianism, child-sacrifice, and it was all tied to religion. From the Ugaritic
literature we see that social disease was rampant. It is interesting to note
that one segment of the Canaanites were destroyed 400 years ahead of the other
segments. Those who lived in Sodom and Gomorrah. To this day, sodomy indicates
a form of perversion.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God ordered them destroyed as a form of the fifth cycle
of discipline because the Hamite line would teach the Sethite line false
doctrine and sexual perversion. The Hamite line would destroy the divine
institutions and therefore the human race if allowed to rage unchecked. God had
given this land to the descendants of Abraham, and as a result, God always
keeps His promises. Gen. 12:1-3. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Now the LORD said to Abram, “Go forth from your country, And
from your relatives And from your father’s house, To the land which I will show
you; And I will make you a great nation, And I will bless you, And make your
name great; And so you shall be a blessing; And I will bless those who bless
you, And the one who curses you I will curse. And in you all the families of
the earth will be blessed.”“  (Genesis 12:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Sons of Shem</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Shem had five sons who are listed in Genesis 10:21-22. This
was the aboriginal race of Persia before the Medes arrived. From Asshur came the
Assyrians and who were Semitic. From Arpachshad came one descendant Abraham. From
Abraham came the Jews and the Arabs. From Lud came the Lydians of Asia Minor. From
Aram came the Syrians. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Also to Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, and the
older brother of Japheth, children were born. The sons of Shem were Elam and
Asshur and Arpachshad and Lud and Aram.” (Genesis 10:21-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Joktan was one of the sons of Eber. Gen. 10:25. The 13
sons of Joktan were the Arabs who are not connected with Abraham and are
mentioned in Genesis 10:26-29. The hill country between Mesha and Sephar was the
original home of the Arabic peoples. Gen. 10:30.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Two sons were born to Eber; the name of the one was Peleg, for
in his days the earth was divided; and his brother's name was Joktan.” (Genesis
10:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Joktan became the father of Almodad and Sheleph and
Hazarmaveth and Jerah and Hadoram and Uzal and Diklah and Obal and Abimael and
Sheba and Ophir and Havilah and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan.”
(Genesis 10:26-29, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now their settlement extended from Mesha as you go toward
Sephar, the hill country of the east.” (Genesis 10:30, NASB)</p>
