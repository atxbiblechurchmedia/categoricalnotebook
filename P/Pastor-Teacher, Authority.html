<h2>Pastor-Teacher, Authority</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Purpose of the Pastor</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The threefold purpose of the pastor is found in Ephesians
4:12. The “saints” refer to the royal family of God with emphasis on the Baptism
of the Spirit. “Equipping the saints” refers to God’s grace policy and
provision for the execution the spiritual life. “Equipping” is the function of
the pastor who, through teaching the mystery doctrine of the Church Age, is
able to see people grow and mature spiritually. All believers are in full-time
Christian service from the moment of their salvation. Christian service is the
normal result of spiritual growth, but never the means. Edification is the
execution of the plan of God for the Church Age believer and subsequent
development of spiritually mature believers, resulting in the glorification of
God.</p>

<p class=Verses>“for the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to
the building up of the body of Christ;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The spiritual growth of the believer comes from the teaching
ministry of the pastor. The body analogy used in Ephesians 4:15-16 relates to
the Body of Christ composed of all Church Age believers. Body function depends
upon the proper use of joints. Athletic coordination depends upon the proper
use of the joints. So in this analogy of the pastor to the joints, it is the
pastor-teacher who gives the Body of Christ its function on earth. The result
of the communication of doctrine is the construction of an edification complex
in your soul. Personal love for God the Father provides motivation for
perception of doctrine. This motivation results in impersonal love for everyone
around you in all aspects of life. It provides the ability to listen
objectively to a pastor-teacher regardless of his personality. </p>

<p class=Verses>“but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all
aspects into Him who is the head, even Christ, from whom the whole body, being
fitted and held together by what every joint supplies, according to the proper
working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building
up of itself in love.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 4:15-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Authority and Responsibilities of The
Pastor-Teacher </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher is responsible for seeing that the
policy and administration of the local church line up with the Word of God, but
he is most importantly a teacher of the Word.  However, he should not involve
himself directly in administration of the local church. That is the
responsibility of the deacon board whose members have the spiritual gift of
administration and other leadership gifts. </p>

<p class=Verses> “For even if I boast somewhat further about our authority,
which the Lord gave for building you up and not for destroying you, I will not
be put to shame,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Corinthians 10:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor has the highest authority in one local church
only. God's delegated authority is the pastor's means of protecting the sheep.
The pastor can abuse this authority by spiritual bullying or by not using his
God-given authority. There is no such thing as a denomination where a pastor
has authority over more than one local church. Authority over more than one
local church was unique to the spiritual gift of Apostleship, which was a
temporary spiritual gift. That gift vanished once the Canon of Scripture was
completed and the Church established. Pastor-teachers now carry the authority
of the local church for the rest of the Church Age.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher's authority over a specific
congregation is developed through faithful and consistent Bible teaching. He is
the one with the most delegated authority now in the post-Canon period of the
Church Age. The authority resides in the teacher while the congregation
assembles to learn doctrine as students under his authority. Heb. 13:7; Heb.
13:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Remember those who led you, who spoke the word of God to
you; and considering the result of their conduct, imitate their faith.&quot; 
(Hebrews 13:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch
over your souls as those who will give an account. Let them do this with joy
and not with grief, for this would be unprofitable for you.&quot;  (Hebrews
13:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers in the congregation “remember” their
pastor-teacher by faithfully attending Bible class and praying for him. The
pastor-teacher’s “rule” over the believers in their local church is based on
the teaching of the Word of God to them, not from privately telling them what
to do. The pastor-teacher’s function is to teach believers what God expects
from them and how to execute His plan based on his studies and teaching from
the pulpit. Believers cannot just read the Bible and learn the Bible doctrine
contained within it. They must be taught by the pastor-teacher. Each believer
must decide for themselves which pastor-teacher is the one they should select
whereby they will grow spiritually.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Extent of the Pastor-Teacher’s Authority </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The authority of God extends down to the most minute
detail in a believer’s life. He has absolute authority over you! The authority
of the pastor-teacher extends to his communication of divine truth to the
congregation of his local church. Titus 2:15. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;These things speak and exhort and reprove with all
authority. Let no one disregard you.&quot;  (Titus 2:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Authority is <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>πιταγη</span>́
(epitagē) and means authority or to command, to charge an individual, or a
congregation. “All authority” means to the highest degree of authority,
absolute authority. Disregard” is <span lang=EL>περιφρονε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(periphroneō) and means to examine on all sides, to consider carefully, to
think around, to think beyond, to come to a negative conclusion, to reject, to
despise.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Pastor-teacher’s authority includes denouncing
anything that causes lack of concentration on the teaching of Bible doctrine in
the local church. That involves your deportment, any distractions, and any
exhibited negative volition. The pastor-teacher is given authority to delegate
functions in the church such as ushering, etc. The pastor-teacher’s authority
involves telling you what class you should be in. The authority of the pastor
does not extend to your social life, your married life, your job, your children,
or your health. 1 Cor. 14:40.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But all things must be done properly and in an orderly
manner.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 14:40, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Leadership Authority in the Local Church </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Peter 5:5, “younger men” refers to all members of
the local congregation in contrast to the pastor-teacher (“elder”). “Be
subject” is <span lang=EL>υ</span>̔<span lang=EL>ποτα</span>́<span lang=EL>σσω</span>
(hupotasso) in the Greek and means to recognize the chain of command and
consider yourself under the authority of the leadership in a local church. This
is in the aorist tense and is referring to the point of time during the
function and activity of the local church in its services, Bible classes, and
means of outreach. A member is to submit to the authority of the pastor and not
try to undermine his authority. Also, if a church has to administer discipline,
the member should submit willing to it or get out.</p>

<p class=Verses>“You younger men, likewise, be subject to your elders; and all
of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, for GOD IS OPPOSED
TO THE PROUD, BUT GIVES GRACE TO THE HUMBLE.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Peter 5:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Hupotasso</i> is also in the middle voice, which means
that the subject is benefitted by the action of the main verb. The congregation
is benefitted by submitting to the authority of the pastor. The imperative mood
means this is a command to all believers. All believers should be members of
some congregation. You should go somewhere where you can feed on the Word of
God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The local church cannot function without authority and
leadership. The leadership of the local church is divided into two categories –
teaching and administrative. 1 Tim. 3:1-7; 1 Tim. 3:9-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“It is a trustworthy statement: if any man aspires to the
office of overseer, it is a fine work he desires to do. An overseer, then, must
be above reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, prudent, respectable,
hospitable, able to teach, not addicted to wine or pugnacious, but gentle,
peaceable, free from the love of money. He must be one who manages his own
household well, keeping his children under control with all dignity (but if a
man does not know how to manage his own household, how will he take care of the
church of God?), and not a new convert, so that he will not become conceited
and fall into the condemnation incurred by the devil. And he must have a good
reputation with those outside the church, so that he will not fall into
reproach and the snare of the devil.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Timothy 3:1-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“but holding to the mystery of the faith with a clear
conscience. These men must also first be tested; then let them serve as deacons
if they are beyond reproach. Women must likewise be dignified, not malicious
gossips, but temperate, faithful in all things. Deacons must be husbands of
only one wife, and good managers of their children and their own households.
For those who have served well as deacons obtain for themselves a high standing
and great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Timothy
3:9-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ultimate leadership must exist in any organization. Local
church leadership is vested in the pastor. Nearly all trouble in a local church
comes from the violation of 1 Peter 5:5. Troublemakers are those who undermine
the authority of a pastor by criticism or other methods. This has to be nipped
in the bud by a strong pastor-teacher who runs a tight ship as unto the Lord.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Authority Orientation to the Pastor-Teacher</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers submit to the pastor-teacher’s authority in
listening to the communication of Bible doctrine. The pastor-teacher’s authority
is established on the basis of the teaching of Bible doctrine. Hence, the issue
is not the man, but the message he provides through his spiritual gift. Since
the pastor's authority is Bible teaching, his ministry does not violate the
privacy of the individual believer. The pastor-teacher is also protected by God
in his faithful performance of his spiritual gift. Isaiah 54:17. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;No weapon that is formed against you will prosper;
And every tongue that accuses you in judgment you will condemn. This is the
heritage of the servants of the LORD, And their vindication is from Me,&quot;
declares the LORD.&quot;  (Isaiah 54:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The spiritual gift of pastor-teacher is God’s method for
teaching the mystery doctrines of the Church Age to every believer. The gift of
pastor-teacher is a spiritual gift sovereignly bestowed by the Holy Spirit at
salvation totally apart from any human merit or ability - as are all spiritual
gifts. The gift provides the right for the pastor to go directly to the Canon
of Scripture and determine what is and is not divine policy. He then grows
spiritually based on his personal study of the Word of God, and communicates
Bible doctrine in public after having prepared. Therefore, he is to study and
teach. 1 Tim. 4:10; 2 Tim. 4:2; 1 Peter 5:2-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For it is for this we labor and strive, because we have
fixed our hope on the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of
believers.&quot;  (1 Timothy 4:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;preach the word; be ready in season and out of season;
reprove, rebuke, exhort, with great patience and instruction.&quot;  (2 Timothy
4:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;shepherd the flock of God among you, exercising oversight
not under compulsion, but voluntarily, according to the will of God; and not
for sordid gain, but with eagerness; nor yet as lording it over those allotted
to your charge, but proving to be examples to the flock. And when the Chief
Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory.&quot;  (1 Peter
5:2-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The congregation is to respond to the pastor’s authority.
Remember those (present active imperative) who keep on having the rule over you
(present middle participle, masculine) who spoke (aorist active indicative) the
Word of God to you, consider (present active participle) imitating or
duplicating [<span lang=EL>μιμε</span>́<span lang=EL>ομαι</span> (mimeomai)]
their manner of life and their faith. Heb. 13:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Remember those who led you, who spoke the word of God to
you; and considering the result of their conduct, imitate their faith.&quot; 
(Hebrews 13:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 13:17, Obey (present middle imperative of <span
lang=EL>πει</span>́<span lang=EL>θω</span> [peithō]) your leaders who rule
over you (present middle participle) and submit (present active imperative of <span
lang=EL>υ</span>̔<span lang=EL>πει</span>́<span lang=EL>κω</span> [hupeikō] -
yield) yourselves for they keep on watching (to be sleepless, wakeful) for your
souls as the ones that shall give account (future active participle of <span
lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>ποδι</span>́<span lang=EL>δωμι</span>
[apodidōmi] - render account) that they may do it (present active subjunctive
of <span lang=EL>ποιε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> [poieō]) with joy, and not
with grief (present active participle of <span lang=EL>στενα</span>́<span
lang=EL>ζω</span> [stenazō]) for that is unprofitable for you (grief -
groaning, unuttered, unexpressed). </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch
over your souls as those who will give an account. Let them do this with joy
and not with grief, for this would be unprofitable for you.&quot;  (Hebrews
13:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is no room for disagreement with the content of a
communicated message. There is no room for mental reservations. There is no
room for fear that false doctrine will go into my soul. Time must be given to
understand what is taught. What is not understood can be put on the backburner
briefly. It is not your job to straighten the pastor out behind his back or to
his face. There is double cursing when the pastor is out of fellowship. The
Lord takes care of him. In cases of reversionism of a communicator, again the
Lord takes care of it. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Biblical authority never coerces volition. Whatever is
commanded in God’s Word never coerces volition. Man has volition and he
chooses. Divine viewpoint never coerces volition because God lets you decide -
positive or negative. You must agree to put yourself under the authority of a
pastor-teacher for better or for worse. At any time you can remove yourself.
You must decide if this church is teaching Bible doctrine or not. If so, you
voluntarily put yourself under the institution (like marriage). </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Complete relaxation under authority comes from
understanding the essence of God, the plan of God, and the chain of command
from God. God’s sovereignty means it’s God’s plan for you to be under a
pastor-teacher. God's perfect righteousness means His plan for you is a perfect
plan with no mistakes. God’s justice means it is fair that you are placed under
the authority of the pastor-teacher. God’s love means that He provides a
doctrinal pastor-teacher for you. God's eternal life means the benefits and
information learned under the pastor-teacher will last forever. Bible doctrine
and divine good last forever and are rewarded. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s omnipotence means He is powerful enough to cause
His plan, including a pastor-teacher, to work together for good. God’s
omnipresence means that He is always with you. Your questions and backburner
issues never cause you to go it alone. God’s omniscience means He knows what is
best for you. God's immutability means He has always been faithful to make sure
Bible doctrine was effectively communicated in every generation. God's veracity
means He has promised to give people pastors after His own heart and He does.
Jer. 3:15. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Then I will give you shepherds after My own heart,
who will feed you on knowledge and understanding.&quot;  (Jeremiah 3:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All it involves on your part is a divinely directed
identification of God, the pastor-teacher, etc. The harshness of authority is
tempered by grace, love, fulfillment, and reward. Authority is the only way to
move from spiritual babyhood to spiritual maturity. Matt. 8:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;For I also am a man under authority, with soldiers
under me; and I say to this one, 'Go!' and he goes, and to another, 'Come!' and
he comes, and to my slave, 'Do this!' and he does it.&quot;&quot;  (Matthew
8:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Lack of Authority Orientation to the Pastor-Teacher </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Constant criticism of the pastor destroys his authority.
Loss of authority neutralizes any effect of the communication of Bible doctrine
and divine viewpoint. The Corinthians wavered so much that Paul really had to
get tough with them and throw his authority around. The Corinthians were
reacting to Paul’s authority and so were doing many things detrimental to their
spiritual life. In 2 Corinthians 10:8, the phrase “our authority” refers to
those with the communication gifts of pastor-teacher as well as Apostleship,
e.g., Apollos and Timothy. The pastor establishes his authority through the
communication of Bible doctrine. Paul makes it very clear that the construction
of the edification complex depends upon accepting the authority of some
pastor-teacher who communicates doctrinal information. People never grow up
without acceptance of authority.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For even if I boast somewhat further about our authority,
which the Lord gave for building you up and not for destroying you, I will not
be put to shame,&quot;  (2 Corinthians 10:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>No communication of Bible doctrine means no intake of
Bible doctrine. No intake of Bible doctrine means scar tissue buildup on the
soul. Scar tissue on the soul means no function under the plan of God and results
in human viewpoint thinking. Human viewpoint means disorientation to the plan
of God and the grace of God. 2 Cor. 10:9-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“for I do not wish to seem as if I would terrify you by my
letters. For they say, “His letters are weighty and strong, but his personal
presence is unimpressive and his speech contemptible.” Let such a person
consider this, that what we are in word by letters when absent, such persons we
are also in deed when present.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Corinthians 10:9-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Human viewpoint attacks or distorts doctrine. Human
viewpoint attacks the Word and the reception and communication of it. Divine
viewpoint of 2 Corinthians 10, although hard on them, is an expression of God’s
love and Paul’s love and concern. To have sins and carnality exposed is
beneficial and, therefore, results in confession of sin and the removal of scar
tissue. Divine viewpoint results in a desire for doctrine, which removes scar
tissue, if it exists. Paul uses his authority to lead carnal believers to
confession of sin and gave an understanding of the grace of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All of this necessary in a local church, if it is to be a
relaxed church. Many relaxed churches makes a relaxed nation. The chain of
command is as follows – Bible doctrine is the only hope and is the ultimate
authority!</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason I am writing these things while absent, so
that when present I need not use severity, in accordance with the authority
which the Lord gave me for building up and not for tearing down.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2
Corinthians 13:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>No one can learn any subject without accepting the
authority of the one who teaches it. Therefore, the importance of understanding
that spiritual edification only comes through the teaching of the pastor in
communicating the mystery doctrine of the Church Age. Edification does not come
in any other way. It is impossible for anyone with the gift of pastor-teacher
to communicate Bible doctrine unless his authority is recognized. Therefore,
the enforcement of good manners and thoughtfulness of others is a part of the
exercise of his authority. Notice that Paul thought it better to talk about
authority in a non-face-to-face situation so that he would not have to chew
them out face-to-face when he arrived.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There must be the right pastor communicating Bible
doctrine to the positive believers in a geographical location. Heb. 13. There
must be a right kind of man for a right kind of woman. The man is the
established authority in the marriage. Eph. 5:22-23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord. For
the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church,
He Himself being the Savior of the body.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 5:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Then there are parents in authority for their children.
Then you have leaders for the nation. The authority is the governmental leader,
“ministers of God.” Rom. 13:1-7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Every person is to be in subjection to the governing
authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist
are established by God. Therefore whoever resists authority has opposed the
ordinance of God; and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon
themselves. For rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior, but for evil.
Do you want to have no fear of authority? Do what is good and you will have
praise from the same; for it is a minister of God to you for good. But if you
do what is evil, be afraid; for it does not bear the sword for nothing; for it
is a minister of God, an avenger who brings wrath on the one who practices
evil. Therefore it is necessary to be in subjection, not only because of wrath,
but also for conscience’ sake. For because of this you also pay taxes, for
rulers are servants of God, devoting themselves to this very thing. Render to
all what is due them: tax to whom tax is due; custom to whom custom; fear to
whom fear; honor to whom honor.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 13:1-7, NASB)</p>
