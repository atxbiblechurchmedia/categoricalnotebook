<h2>Paul, Utilization of Pastor-Teachers Serving Under Him</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul established the church at Corinth. There were many
believers already at Corinth. Acts 18:1; Acts 18:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“After these things he left Athens and went to Corinth.” (Acts
18:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“for I am with you, and no man will attack you in order to harm
you, for I have many people in this city.&quot;” (Acts 18:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Apollos began to minister while Paul was still there. Paul
left Corinth after 18 months, leaving Apollos there to minister. Acts 18:24;
Acts 19:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now a Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, an eloquent
man, came to Ephesus; and he was mighty in the Scriptures.” (Acts 18:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“It happened that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed
through the upper country and came to Ephesus, and found some disciples.” (Acts
19:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Problems developed in the church at Corinth with
divisions and factions over Apollos and Paul. Apollos left Corinth because of
the conflict and went to Paul at Ephesus. Paul tried to get him to return but
he refused. 1 Cor. 1 tyhrough 1 Cor. 3; 1 Cor. 16:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But concerning Apollos our brother, I encouraged him greatly
to come to you with the brethren; and it was not at all his desire to come now,
but he will come when he has opportunity.” (1 Corinthians 16:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul got letters from the house of Chloe from Corinth for
help. 1 Cor. 1:10-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now I exhort you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ, that you all agree and that there be no divisions among you, but that
you be made complete in the same mind and in the same judgment. For I have been
informed concerning you, my brethren, by Chloe's people, that there are
quarrels among you. Now I mean this, that each one of you is saying, &quot;I am
of Paul,&quot; and &quot;I of Apollos,&quot; and &quot;I of Cephas,&quot; and
&quot;I of Christ.&quot;” (1 Corinthians 1:10-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul sent Timothy who was not able to straighten out the
problems. Apparently he was accompanied by Silvanus. 1 Cor. 4:17; 1 Cor. 16:10;
2 Cor. 1:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason I have sent to you Timothy, who is my beloved
and faithful child in the Lord, and he will remind you of my ways which are in
Christ, just as I teach everywhere in every church.” (1 Corinthians 4:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without cause to
be afraid, for he is doing the Lord's work, as I also am.” (1 Corinthians
16:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the Son of God, Christ Jesus, who was preached among you
by us—by me and Silvanus and Timothy—was not yes and no, but is yes in Him.” (2
Corinthians 1:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul assigned Timothy to Ephesus at the beginning the
third journey into Macedonia and to Corinth. 1 Tim. 1:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“To Timothy, my true child in the faith: Grace, mercy and peace
from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.” (1 Timothy 1:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul sent Titus on ahead to Corinth to straighten out the
problems, apparently to meet at Troas. Titus didn’t show there soon enough, so
Paul went on into Macedonia. 2 Cor. 2:12-13; 2 Cor. 7:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ and when a
door was opened for me in the Lord, I had no rest for my spirit, not finding
Titus my brother; but taking my leave of them, I went on to Macedonia.” (2
Corinthians 2:12-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For even when we came into Macedonia our flesh had no rest,
but we were afflicted on every side: conflicts without, fears within.” (2
Corinthians 7:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul and Titus united in Macedonia with Titus and conveyed
the success of his mission. Titus had taken care of the problems. 2 Cor. 7:6-7;
2 Cor. 7:13-15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But God, who comforts the depressed, comforted us by the
coming of Titus; and not only by his coming, but also by the comfort with which
he was comforted in you, as he reported to us your longing, your mourning, your
zeal for me; so that I rejoiced even more.” (2 Corinthians 7:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason we have been comforted. And besides our
comfort, we rejoiced even much more for the joy of Titus, because his spirit
has been refreshed by you all. For if in anything I have boasted to him about
you, I was not put to shame; but as we spoke all things to you in truth, so
also our boasting before Titus proved to be the truth. His affection abounds
all the more toward you, as he remembers the obedience of you all, how you
received him with fear and trembling.” (2 Corinthians 7:13-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul wrote 2 Corinthians explaining that he wanted to
send Titus to them again to finish the good job that he had begun there.  2
Cor. 8:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So we urged Titus that as he had previously made a beginning,
so he would also complete in you this gracious work as well.” (2 Corinthians
8:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul returned to Jerusalem and stopped off near Ephesus
to send Timothy and Erastus into Macedonia for a brief ministry while he remained
a brief time in Asia on his way to Jerusalem and his sure fate. Acts 19:21-22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now after these things were finished, Paul purposed in the
Spirit to go to Jerusalem after he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia,
saying, &quot;After I have been there, I must also see Rome.&quot; And having
sent into Macedonia two of those who ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, he
himself stayed in Asia for a while.” (Acts 19:21-22, NASB)</p>
