<h2><a name="_Pentecost"></a><a name="_D-The_Day_of"></a>Day of Pentecost</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Day of Pentecost in approximately 32 AD, was the day that
the dispensation of the Church Age began. The Day of Pentecost was the
fulfillment of two prophecies. The first prophecy to be fulfilled was the prophecy
of tongues where the Jews would be evangelized in Gentile languages as a sign
that the fifth cycle of discipline would soon begin. The second to be fulfilled
was the prophecy of the Baptism of the Holy Spirit. Isaiah 28:11; 1 Cor.
14:21-22; Acts 1:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Indeed, He will speak to this people Through stammering lips
and a foreign tongue,” (Isaiah 28:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“In the Law it is written, &quot;BY MEN OF STRANGE TONGUES AND
BY THE LIPS OF STRANGERS I WILL SPEAK TO THIS PEOPLE, AND EVEN SO THEY WILL NOT
LISTEN TO ME,&quot; says the Lord. So then tongues are for a sign, not to those
who believe but to unbelievers; but prophecy is for a sign, not to unbelievers
but to those who believe.” (1 Corinthians 14:21-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with
the Holy Spirit not many days from now.&quot;” (Acts 1:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Baptism of the Holy Spirit signaled the beginning of
the Church Age. John 14:20; 1 Cor. 12:13. See category on the dispensation of <a
href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/C/The%20Church%20Age.html">The Church Age</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and
you in Me, and I in you.” (John 14:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether
Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one
Spirit.” (1 Corinthians 12:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Church began in one local spot - Jerusalem.
Consequently, on the Day of Pentecost and after, there were Jewish Age
believers in other locations that had not yet had the Baptism of the Holy
Spirit. Even though believers, the Holy Spirit had not yet entered them into union
with Christ making them Church Age believers. Jewish believers received the
filling of the Holy Spirit in Acts 2:1-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“When the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in
one place. And suddenly there came from heaven a noise like a violent rushing
wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. And there appeared
to them tongues as of fire distributing themselves, and they rested on each one
of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with
other tongues, as the Spirit was giving them utterance.” (Acts 2:1-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Gentile believers received the filling of the Holy Spirit
in Caesarea in Acts 10:44-48 and Acts 11:15-16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit
fell upon all those who were listening to the message. All the circumcised
believers who came with Peter were amazed, because the gift of the Holy Spirit
had been poured out on the Gentiles also. For they were hearing them speaking
with tongues and exalting God. Then Peter answered, &quot;Surely no one can
refuse the water for these to be baptized who have received the Holy Spirit
just as we did, can he?&quot; And he ordered them to be baptized in the name of
Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay on for a few days.” (Acts 10:44-48,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them
just as He did upon us at the beginning. &quot;And I remembered the word of the
Lord, how He used to say, 'John baptized with water, but you will be baptized
with the Holy Spirit.'” (Acts 11:15-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Other believers of the Age of Israel in various locations
and at different times received the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, entering them
into union with Christ, making them Church Age believers. Acts 19:1-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“It happened that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed
through the upper country and came to Ephesus, and found some disciples. He
said to them, &quot;Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?&quot;
And they said to him, &quot;No, we have not even heard whether there is a Holy
Spirit.&quot; And he said, &quot;Into what then were you baptized?&quot; And
they said, &quot;Into John's baptism.&quot; Paul said, &quot;John baptized with
the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in Him who was coming
after him, that is, in Jesus.&quot; When they heard this, they were baptized in
the name of the Lord Jesus. And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the
Holy Spirit came on them, and they began speaking with tongues and
prophesying.” (Acts 19:1-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Church started local and then became universal. In 30
years, the Church covered the world. The Book of Acts is simply a history of
the Pre-Canon Church. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Holy Spirit could not come (Baptism of the Holy
Spirit) in the Age of Israel because Christ had not yet come in the flesh.
Jesus Christ had not yet died, risen, and ascended, nor was He yet seated at
the right hand of the Father. John 7:37-39. See category on the <a
href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/B/Baptism%20of%20the%20Holy%20Spirit.html">Baptism of the Holy Spirit</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood
and cried out, saying, &quot;If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and
drink. &quot;He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, 'From his innermost
being will flow rivers of living water.'&quot; But this He spoke of the Spirit,
whom those who believed in Him were to receive; for the Spirit was not yet
given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.” (John 7:37-39, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There had to be the substitutionary spiritual death of
Jesus Christ on the Cross followed by His physical death, burial, resurrection,
and ascension before Positional Truth could occur. See category on <a
href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/P/Positional%20Truth.html">Positional Truth</a>.</p>
