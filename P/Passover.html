<h2>Passover</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To God, in Eternity Past, the death of Jesus Christ was
an accomplished fact long before it became a reality. Therefore, the Father
recognized as sufficient the symbolic offering of the sacrificial lamb
throughout the Old Testament. In Old Testament times, they gave testimony by
ceremony. The ceremonies gave testimony to the death of Christ and the work of
Christ on the cross that was to come. 1 Peter 1:19-20; Eph. 3:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and
spotless, the blood of Christ. For He was foreknown before the foundation of
the world, but has appeared in these last times for the sake of you” (1 Peter
1:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“This was in accordance with the eternal purpose which He
carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord,” (Ephesians 3:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Thus, the shed blood of the animal became an atonement or
covering for the guilty Old Testament sinner. God passed over the sins of the
people until the coming of the Lamb of God, who would take away the sins of the
world. Exodus 12:13; John 1:29.</p>

<p class=Verses>“'The blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you
live; and when I see the blood I will pass over you, and no plague will befall
you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.” (Exodus 12:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said,
&quot;Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!” (John 1:29,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God Himself provided His own Lamb, who gave Himself
willingly, to become the Passover Sacrifice. In 1 Corinthians 5:7, “For Christ
our Passover also has been sacrificed.” Acts 2:23; Rev. 13:8; John 10:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Clean out the old leaven so that you may be a new lump, just
as you are in fact unleavened. For Christ our Passover also has been
sacrificed.” (1 Corinthians 5:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“this Man, delivered over by the predetermined plan and
foreknowledge of God, you nailed to a cross by the hands of godless men and put
Him to death.” (Acts 2:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“All who dwell on the earth will worship him, everyone whose
name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life
of the Lamb who has been slain.” (Revelation 13:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;No one has taken it away from Me, but I lay it down on
My own initiative. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to
take it up again. This commandment I received from My Father.&quot;” (John
10:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord’s substitutionary spiritual death on the Cross
provided the means to reconcile the world (unlimited atonement) to God that
through appropriation of His saving grace, eternal life might be bestowed upon
all who believe. Eph. 2:8-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not
of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one
may boast.” (Ephesians 2:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the last Passover, Jesus showed His disciples that there
would be no more Passover Feasts after this one - no more killing of lambs. The
Passover Feast was just a shadow (picture) of Christ Himself who would bring a
greater deliverance to the people - salvation. Jesus also showed that the
shadow was soon to become the reality and that they would soon look back to the
Cross instead of looking forward to it. Col. 2:17; Heb. 10:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“things which are a mere shadow of what is to come; but the
substance belongs to Christ.” (Colossians 2:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the Law, since it has only a shadow of the good things to
come and not the very form of things, can never, by the same sacrifices which
they offer continually year by year, make perfect those who draw near.”
(Hebrews 10:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Passover of the Age of Israel became the Communion
table in the Church Age. The purpose of the Communion table is harmony, remembrance
of the Lord Jesus Christ, restoration to fellowship with God via confession of
sin biblically, and fellowship. 1 Cor. 11:20-34.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, &quot;This
is My body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of Me.&quot; In the same
way He took the cup also after supper, saying, &quot;This cup is the new
covenant in My blood; do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of
Me.&quot;” (1 Corinthians 11:24-25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord
in an unworthy manner, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.
But a man must examine himself, and in so doing he is to eat of the bread and
drink of the cup.” (1 Corinthians 11:27-28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The First Passover</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Children of Israel had been slaves in Egypt for 400
years. The time of their deliverance had come. In spite of the plagues, Pharaoh
had refused to let them go. Exodus 11:1-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now the LORD said to Moses, &quot;One more plague I will bring
on Pharaoh and on Egypt; after that he will let you go from here. When he lets
you go, he will surely drive you out from here completely.” (Exodus 11:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Exodus 11:2, “hearing of the people” means they were
not listening to Pharaoh. In Exodus 11:4, “I am” refers to the Lord Jesus
Christ. Exodus 12:12. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Speak now in the hearing of the people that each man ask
from his neighbor and each woman from her neighbor for articles of silver and
articles of gold.&quot;” (Exodus 11:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Moses said, &quot;Thus says the LORD, 'About midnight I am
going out into the midst of Egypt,” (Exodus 11:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“'For I will go through the land of Egypt on that night, and
will strike down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast;
and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments—I am the LORD.”
(Exodus 12:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Exodus 11:7, “distinction between the Egyptians and
Israel” refers to the difference between the unbeliever and the believer. God
protects His own. Rom. 8:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“'But against any of the sons of Israel a dog will not even
bark, whether against man or beast, that you may understand how the LORD makes
a distinction between Egypt and Israel.'” (Exodus 11:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in
Christ Jesus.” (Romans 8:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Exodus 12:2, the principle was that as of the 14th of
April (Passover), the Jews would begin a new life that would go from bondage to
freedom in one night. All time would be measured in terms of regeneration
rather than in terms of natural birth - from the point of liberation from
bondage. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;This month shall be the beginning of months for you; it
is to be the first month of the year to you.” (Exodus 12:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Exodus 12:3, “all the congregation of Israel” means
that everyone had to get this information. “Each one” means that each person
has to accept Jesus Christ as their Messiah for themselves.  “A lamb for each
household” means that each had to eat of that lamb, which is a picture of faith
 belief in Jesus Christ, their Messiah. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Speak to all the congregation of Israel, saying, 'On the
tenth of this month they are each one to take a lamb for themselves, according
to their fathers' households, a lamb for each household.” (Exodus 12:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Exodus 12:5, “unblemished” refers to the impeccability
of the Lord Jesus Christ as our Savior.</p>

<p class=Verses>“'Your lamb shall be an unblemished male a year old; you may
take it from the sheep or from the goats.” (Exodus 12:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Exodus 12:6, “until the fourteenth day” refers to when
the lamb was slain, which speaks of the day Jesus Christ would die spiritually
as our substitute on the Cross. The tenth day in Exodus 12:3 speaks of our
Lord’s virgin birth (incarnation). The eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth days
speak of public ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ who was without blemish,
without sin. The Jews watched the Passover lamb for three days to make sure it
was entirely perfect. “At twilight” means between the evenings. Passover was
unique among the feasts. It was a memorial that looked forward anticipating the
future atoning work of our Lord on the Cross.</p>

<p class=Verses>“'You shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month,
then the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel is to kill it at
twilight.” (Exodus 12:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Exodus 12:7, the blood of the lamb was to be painted
on the two door posts and on the door lintel of the houses the Jews occupied.
The blood only on the door wherein they were eating. </p>

<p class=Verses>“'Moreover, they shall take some of the blood and put it on the
two doorposts and on the lintel of the houses in which they eat it.” (Exodus
12:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Exodus 12:8, “that same night” refers to the Passover
night. “Roasted with fire” refers to the work of the Lord Jesus Christ being
judged for our sins. “Shall eat” is a picture of non-meritorious faith.
“Unleavened bread” represents the sinless humanity of the Lord Jesus Christ in
hypostatic union. “Bitter herbs” was a reminder of the principle of grace. No
one ever earns or deserves grace. This is a picture of salvation by grace. 2
Cor. 5:12; 1 Peter 2:24; Rom. 5:8; Isaiah 53:5-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“'They shall eat the flesh that same night, roasted with fire,
and they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.” (Exodus 12:8,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“We are not again commending ourselves to you but are giving
you an occasion to be proud of us, so that you will have an answer for those
who take pride in appearance and not in heart.” (2 Corinthians 5:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, so that
we might die to sin and live to righteousness; for by His wounds you were
healed.” (1 Peter 2:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we
were yet sinners, Christ died for us.” (Romans 5:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But He was pierced through for our transgressions, He was
crushed for our iniquities; The chastening for our well-being fell upon Him,
And by His scourging we are healed. All of us like sheep have gone astray, Each
of us has turned to his own way; But the LORD has caused the iniquity of us all
To fall on Him.” (Isaiah 53:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Exodus 12:9, we have the description of how to properly
prepare the lamb. “Do not eat any of it raw” is an admonition to cook the lamb
by roasting only. Roasting the lamb by fire recognizes that the Lord Jesus
Christ would be judged for all sins of mankind on the Cross. “Or boiled at all
with water” means that there will be only one way to prepare the lamb and is a
reference to no substitute for the blood of Jesus Christ such as ceremonialism
or ritualism. “Its head” is a reference to the believer’s mental attitude and
decision making. “And its legs” refers to service or being in a position to
serve. “Along with its entrails” refers to the power inside the believer to
serve.</p>

<p class=Verses>“'Do not eat any of it raw or boiled at all with water, but
rather roasted with fire, both its head and its legs along with its entrails.”
(Exodus 12:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Exodus 12:10, if you don’t eat (believe), the
alternative is fire (judgment). John 3:18. </p>

<p class=Verses>“'And you shall not leave any of it over until morning, but
whatever is left of it until morning, you shall burn with fire.” (Exodus 12:10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;He who believes in Him is not judged; he who does not
believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the
only begotten Son of God.” (John 3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Exodus 12:11 was given a four-fold standard operating
procedure for eating. “With your loins girded” refers to clothes that you can
walk or move quickly. Once you eat, be ready to move. How? By knowing God’s
Word in the mind, convert it to <i>epignosis</i> knowledge by faith, thus
functioning daily under the grace apparatus for perception while staying in fellowship.
2 Peter 1:1; 1 John 1:9; Phil. 3:13; Heb. 12:13-15. </p>

<p class=Verses>“'Now you shall eat it in this manner: with your loins girded,
your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it in
haste—it is the LORD'S Passover.” (Exodus 12:11, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“Simon Peter, a bond-servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, To
those who have received a faith of the same kind as ours, by the righteousness
of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ:” (2 Peter 1:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it
yet; but one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to
what lies ahead,” (Philippians 3:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and make straight paths for your feet, so that the limb which
is lame may not be put out of joint, but rather be healed. Pursue peace with
all men, and the sanctification without which no one will see the Lord. See to
it that no one comes short of the grace of God; that no root of bitterness
springing up causes trouble, and by it many be defiled;” (Hebrews 12:13-15,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Exodus 12:11, “sandals on your feet” refers to
production as the result of being in fellowship. “Your staff in your hand”
refers to the Word of God that contain His promises on which to lean using faith-rest.
“You shall eat it in haste” refers to the believer learning a maximum amount of
the Word of God in minimum time. This is quick transfer of <i>gnosis</i> to <i>epignosis</i>
in the right lobe of the soul. In Exodus 12:12, the alternative is “judgment”
(fire) which comes from God. John 3:36.</p>

<p class=Verses>“'For I will go through the land of Egypt on that night, and
will strike down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast;
and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments—I am the LORD.”
(Exodus 12:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who
does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on
him.&quot;” (John 3:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Exodus 12:13, Passover connotes eternal security as
well as salvation. Everyone in Christ is secure forever. Everyone in the house
is secure. Being in the house refers to belief in the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior,
which is a picture of Christ in the believer and the believer in Christ. John
14:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“'The blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you
live; and when I see the blood I will pass over you, and no plague will befall
you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.” (Exodus 12:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and
you in Me, and I in you.” (John 14:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Exodus 12:14, “memorial” means anticipating and
remembering. Jews in the Old Testament looked forward to the Cross. We look
back to the Cross. They had the lamb and the unleavened bread. They only had
the blood on the door-posts on the first Passover in 1441 BC. From then on, the
Jews didn’t live in houses and there were no posts in the tents. They used the
cup representing the fruit of the vine, not wine - no leaven. </p>

<p class=Verses>“'Now this day will be a memorial to you, and you shall
celebrate it as a feast to the LORD; throughout your generations you are to
celebrate it as a permanent ordinance.” (Exodus 12:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Exodus 12:26-27 was a command to the Israelites. The
verbal and pictured Word, the plan of salvation was passed down from parent to
child in each believing family as follows: 1) man was born a sinner; 2) sin has
come between man and God, so man cannot come into the presence of God until
something is done about his sinful state; 3) God’s promise was that someday, at
the right time, God would send His perfect Son into the world to take away sin;
4) until then, the sin must be covered in God’s sight; 5) a lamb, perfect and
innocent, must be offered, its blood to be shed and sprinkled as an atonement
for sin; 6) when the Son of God (Lamb of God) came, He would not merely cover,
but would remove sin and its penalty.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;And when your children say to you, 'What does this rite
mean to you?' you shall say, 'It is a Passover sacrifice to the LORD who passed
over the houses of the sons of Israel in Egypt when He smote the Egyptians, but
spared our homes.'&quot; And the people bowed low and worshiped.” (Exodus
12:26-27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The application of Exodus 12:26-27 is that today,
salvation is the same at it was in Old Testament times - believe on the Lord
Jesus Christ. Also, in Old Testament times in God’s sight, this was already an
accomplished fact. Jesus Christ gave His life freely. Jews brought their
sacrifices to the Levitical priest by their free will. We also accept the work
of Jesus Christ through our free will. The Feast of the Passover should have
been a continual reminder of the One who was to come and would die spiritually in
their place. Instead, it became merely a ritual or a ceremony which they went
through, with little realization of the Person it represented. 1 Peter 1:19-20;
John 10:18; Lev. 1:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and
spotless, the blood of Christ. For He was foreknown before the foundation of
the world, but has appeared in these last times for the sake of you” (1 Peter
1:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;No one has taken it away from Me, but I lay it down on
My own initiative. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to
take it up again. This commandment I received from My Father.&quot;” (John
10:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“'If his offering is a burnt offering from the herd, he shall
offer it, a male without defect; he shall offer it at the doorway of the tent
of meeting, that he may be accepted before the LORD.” (Leviticus 1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Last Passover</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Old Testament times, they gave testimony by ceremony.
The ceremony of slaying the lamb was a testimony to the future death of Christ
on the Cross. The ceremony of the Day of Atonement (sprinkling of the blood)
was a ceremony that spoke of the future substitutionary spiritual death of Jesus
Christ on the Cross.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the Last Passover, Jesus Christ wanted to show His
disciples that there would be no more Passover Feasts after this one. No more
killing of lambs. The Passover Feast was just a shadow or picture of Christ
Himself who would bring a greater deliverance to the people through salvation.
The shadow would soon become the reality. They would soon look back to the Cross
instead of forward to it. Col. 2:17; Heb. 10:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“things which are a mere shadow of what is to come; but the
substance belongs to Christ.” (Colossians 2:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the Law, since it has only a shadow of the good things to
come and not the very form of things, can never, by the same sacrifices which
they offer continually year by year, make perfect those who draw near.”
(Hebrews 10:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the Last Passover, a love feast was eaten before
communion. Judas left between Matthew 26:25 and Matthew 26:26 according to John
13:30-32. Judas was present at the Love Feast, but he departed before
communion. All the time Jesus was giving out the communion elements to His
eleven disciples, Judas was betraying Him.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And Judas, who was betraying Him, said, &quot;Surely it is not
I, Rabbi?&quot; Jesus said to him, &quot;You have said it yourself.&quot;”
(Matthew 26:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“While they were eating, Jesus took some bread, and after a
blessing, He broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, &quot;Take, eat;
this is My body.&quot;” (Matthew 26:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So after receiving the morsel he went out immediately; and it
was night. Therefore when he had gone out, Jesus said, &quot;Now is the Son of
Man glorified, and God is glorified in Him; if God is glorified in Him, God
will also glorify Him in Himself, and will glorify Him immediately.” (John
13:30-32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 26:28, “the covenant” refers to the New
Covenant of salvation by grace. The Passover was then changed into the Lord’s
table, our communion table, looking back to the Cross. God has a perfect plan
and a perfect timetable. God’s Lamb was to die at the very time when the Jewish
Passover took place, which, for all these years, looked forward to the death of
the Lamb. John 18:28, John 18:39. See category on the <a
href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/NO/New%20Covenant%20to%20Israel.html">New Covenant to Israel</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“for this is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for
many for forgiveness of sins.” (Matthew 26:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas into the Praetorium, and it
was early; and they themselves did not enter into the Praetorium so that they
would not be defiled, but might eat the Passover.” (John 18:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But you have a custom that I release someone for you at
the Passover; do you wish then that I release for you the King of the
Jews?&quot;” (John 18:39, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Even while the Roman officials were pronouncing judgment
on the Lord Jesus Christ, the preparation for the Passover began. John 19:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now it was the day of preparation for the Passover; it was
about the sixth hour. And he said to the Jews, &quot;Behold, your King!&quot;”
(John 19:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Little did they realize that prophecy was being fulfilled
by rejecting the One who came to save them. John 1:11. </p>

<p class=Verses>“He came to His own, and those who were His own did not receive
Him.” (John 1:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>So the Lamb, without spot and blemish, Jesus Christ, our
Passover, was sacrificed for us. 1 Cor. 5:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Clean out the old leaven so that you may be a new lump, just
as you are in fact unleavened. For Christ our Passover also has been
sacrificed.” (1 Corinthians 5:7, NASB)</p>
