<h2>Pre-Canon Revelation</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Old Testament times, revelation from God was given by
shadows that anticipated the Messiah, Jesus Christ in the future going to the Cross
to atone for the sins of all mankind. In the shadow system, they used repeating
rituals to teach God’s Word. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Old Testament revelation included dreams given to persons
other than prophets such as Joseph (a believer), Nebuchadnezzar (an unbeliever
when he had the dreams), and Pharaoh (an unbeliever always). Old Testament
revelation included visions given to prophets such as Daniel in Daniel 10:7-8, John
the Apostle in Revelation, and John the Baptist in Revelation 3. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now I, Daniel, alone saw the vision, while the men who
were with me did not see the vision; nevertheless, a great dread fell on them,
and they ran away to hide themselves. So I was left alone and saw this great
vision; yet no strength was left in me, for my natural color turned to a
deathly pallor, and I retained no strength.&quot;  (Daniel 10:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Old Testament revelation included trances primarily to
prophets such as Balaam in Numbers 24:4 and Numbers 24:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The oracle of him who hears the words of God, Who sees
the vision of the Almighty, Falling down, yet having his eyes uncovered,&quot; 
(Numbers 24:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The oracle of him who hears the words of God, And knows
the knowledge of the Most High, Who sees the vision of the Almighty, Falling
down, yet having his eyes uncovered.&quot;  (Numbers 24:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Old Testament revelation included direct spoken
conversation as was spoken to Moses in the giving of the Law and in Christophanies
such as in the appearance of the Lord Jesus Christ to Abraham. Prophets
received direct revelation. Priests interpreted and taught written revelation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Pre-Canon, Post-Ascension period, revelation from
God included direct revelation of Scripture given to apostles and through the temporary
spiritual gift of knowledge. Revelation in this period also included trances primarily
to apostles. Examples are Peter in Acts 10:10 and Paul in Acts 22:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But he became hungry and was desiring to eat; but while
they were making preparations, he fell into a trance;&quot;  (Acts 10:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;It happened when I returned to Jerusalem and was
praying in the temple, that I fell into a trance,&quot;  (Acts 22:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Revelation from God after the completed written Canon of
Scripture changed to reality and is now from the written Canon of Scripture only.
With reality present, the shadows are no longer valid. Once you are looking back
at the Cross, we have the inerrant inspired Word of God in print. The spiritual
life becomes a matter of perception instead of ritual.</p>
