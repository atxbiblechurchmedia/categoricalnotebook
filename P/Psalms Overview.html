<h2><a name="_Psalm_51,_David’s"></a><a name="_D-Psalm_51,_David’s"></a><a
name="_Psalm_55"></a><a name="_Principles_of_Doctrine_1"></a>Psalms Overview </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Within the prayers or songs of the Psalms is a definite recognition
of the person of God and honest descriptions of the soul condition of the one
praying. The prayers and songs pictured believers under pressure and their
thinking when dealing with those pressures. There are patterns in the Psalms of
the life practice of believers who were either under divine discipline or the self-induced
misery of reversionism.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Psalms show some of the greatest men at their lowest.
One keynote factor in most of the Psalms is the suffering caused by personal
enemies. The biblical solution to dealing with personal enemies is always to put
it in the Lord’s hands. The content of the prayers and desperation of the
people revealed definitely and clearly the relationship of Bible doctrine to
sustainment and survival of the believer.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The content of the prayers also reveals the absolute
objective for each believer to be satisfied with instruction from the true
Water of Life, the Word of God. The Psalms indicate the route and outcome of
not getting the true water for the soul with the emotions taking over. This is
feeding on tears. They show the absolute impossibility for the emotions to
satisfy. The Psalms make it very plain that a man’s friend may become his
greatest personal foe. Examples include Saul, Absalom, Ahithophel (David’s
close acquaintance), and David’s friends.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Psalms demonstrate that the men of the Word were just
like we are today with no special ability to avoid unpleasantries or to handle
them. They were subject to the same type of viciousness as we and often had the
same difficulties in handling it. The Psalms also make perfectly clear the need
and basis for divine discipline (justice and mercy). </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Psalms show the attitude of those involved in the
experience of divine discipline and the rebuilding after divine discipline. The
Psalms describe clearly the wretched state of the mature believer under divine
discipline and the advantage of happiness in fellowship with God. It is far better
to stay in fellowship than to go the negative volition route.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Psalms state the difference between the sinful act
and the rebellion under the surface or sin and transgression. The Psalms illustrate
that God holds the believer personally accountable for their sins and their
personal responsibility to get back into fellowship. The Psalms make clear the
only vehicle of confession of sin biblically to God resulting in God's restoration
of the believer to fellowship.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Psalms show the content of the confession, the
thought, the act, the words spoken, and their foundation in rebellion to God.
The Psalms make clear the results of confession, that of forgiveness. The
Psalms make clear that every believer must intercede for their own sins. The
Psalms illustrate the purpose of divine discipline is to bring the sinning
believer back to the reality of their need for cleansing and restoration to
fellowship with God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Psalms reveal that confession, forgiveness, and
restoration to fellowship is a matter of cursing turned to blessing. The cry of
distress is turned to the cry of joy. The Psalms identify the way of
deliverance or escape, that of confession. The Psalms indicate the chronology
of a believer’s life - confession, restoration, then divine good production.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Psalms depict the experiences of others and are used
as instruction for the prevention of sins. The Psalms show that the correction
and direction for the believer out of fellowship is divine discipline, the
bridle and bit example; and that the correction and direction for the believer
in fellowship is from instruction contained in the Word.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Just as you have happiness before you get out of
fellowship and after you get back in fellowship, so you have guidance before you
get out of fellowship and then differently until you get back in. The Psalms demonstrate
the principle of application of Bible doctrine in prayer. Unless prayers are
made in accordance to the desired will of God, they can hardly be answered.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Psalms affirm that all sin is against God. David said
in Psalms 51:4, “Against You, You only, I have sinned.” The Psalms make clear,
therefore, that since sin is against God, and only God has a right to judge it.
The Psalms state that the internal source of temptation to commit personal sins
and transgression is the inherited old sin nature.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Against You, You only, I have sinned And done what is evil in
Your sight, So that You are justified when You speak And blameless when You
judge.” (Psalms 51:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Psalms recognize that God’s cleansing is the only
source for a restoration to full capacity in service to God in the spiritual
life. The Psalms make clear the responsibility of the believer once back in
fellowship. This responsibility for the mature believer is divine good production.
The Psalms show clearly the damage incurred to others when a believer is out of
fellowship and in reversionism.</p>
