<h2><a name="_Priority"></a>Priority</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The definition of priority from Webster is superiority in
rank, position, or privilege. The order of preference based on urgency,
importance or merit. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The book of Acts begins with the doctrine of proof. The
doctrine of visible proof is then vitally connected to doctrinal content, that
being the doctrine of promise as given in the Old Testament with special
emphasis on the promise of the indwelling and filling of the Holy Spirit. By
referring to the doctrine of promise and a reference to John’s baptism, the
natural result was the disciples connecting this with the kingdom concept. This
is what came to their minds immediately. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Therefore, in Acts 1:7, Jesus had to turn their attention
to the immediate priority established by the doctrine of promise, the coming of
the Church Age and away from the kingdom. This introduces us to the doctrine of
priority. This does not mean that we should not care or know about the time and
seasons that exist. 1 Thess. 5:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He said to them, &quot;It is not for you to know times or
epochs which the Father has fixed by His own authority; &quot;  (Acts 1:7,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now as to the times and the epochs, brethren, you have no
need of anything to be written to you.&quot;  (1 Thessalonians 5:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Therefore, Acts 1:8 brings them to what they should be
concerned for, that is, their priority at the outset of Christianity,
evangelism. This is priority #1 at both the beginning of the Church Age and the
beginning of a local church in a new area.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come
upon you; and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and
Samaria, and even to the remotest part of the earth.&quot; &quot;  (Acts 1:8,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Classifications of Priorities in the Scriptures</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Various
classifications of priorities in the scriptures include: The priorities of the
local church as a unit. The priorities of the pastor of a local church. The
priorities of the board of a local church. The priorities of a husband in the
home. The priorities of a wife in the home. The priorities of a man in training
for the ministry. The changing priorities of a local church. The priorities of
children as determined by parents. The priorities of life within the framework
of the divine institutions.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Classifications of Priorities</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Priorities of a local church at its beginning.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 2:42 and Acts 1:14, “continually devoting
themselves” is <span lang=EL>προσκαρτερε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(proskartereō) and means they continued steadfast in doctrine, in the verbal
teaching. They did this before the church was formed.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;They were continually devoting themselves to the
apostles' teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to
prayer.&quot;  (Acts 2:42, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;These all with one mind were continually devoting
themselves to prayer, along with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and
with His brothers.&quot;  (Acts 1:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 6:4, “devote ourselves” is also <span lang=EL>προσκαρτερε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (proskartereō) and here means to give constant attention to
prayer and the ministry of the Word by the communicators. In Acts 2:46, “continuing”
is <span lang=EL>προσκαρτερε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (proskartereō) and
means to continue all the time in a certain place.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the
ministry of the word.&quot;&quot;  (Acts 6:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Day by day continuing with one mind in the temple, and
breaking bread from house to house, they were taking their meals together with
gladness and sincerity of heart,&quot;  (Acts 2:46, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Galatians 2:9, they continued with one mind in
“fellowship” or <span lang=EL>κοινωνι</span>́<span lang=EL>α</span> (koinōnia)
in the Greek. Fellowship here involved participation and sharing - sharing of
labors, good, etc. Fellowship also involved friendship which is the right hand
of fellowship and a sign and pledge of fellowship. It also involved joint
material contributions with collections as an exhibit of the proof of
fellowship. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and recognizing the grace that had been given to me,
James and Cephas and John, who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and
Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, so that we might go to the Gentiles and
they to the circumcised.&quot;  (Galatians 2:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 2:46, they continued with one mind in breaking
bread began with a normal human significance and ended with a spiritual one - the
feeding of the multitudes as an aftermath of their taking in spiritual food. Matt.
14:19; Matt. 15:36.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Ordering the people to sit down on the grass, He took the
five loaves and the two fish, and looking up toward heaven, He blessed the
food, and breaking the loaves He gave them to the disciples, and the disciples
gave them to the crowds,&quot;  (Matthew 14:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and He took the seven loaves and the fish; and giving
thanks, He broke them and started giving them to the disciples, and the
disciples gave them to the people.&quot;  (Matthew 15:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At this point, Jesus combined the natural factor of
eating with the Old Testament unleavened bread concept with the memorial
concept of His death. The feast of unleavened bread had the significance of
fellowship with Christ in the spiritual life. Matt. 26:26.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;While they were eating, Jesus took some bread, and after
a blessing, He broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, &quot;Take,
eat; this is My body.&quot; &quot;  (Matthew 26:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Breaking of bread would bear the significance of the
fulfillment of the feast of unleavened bread from the Old Testament standpoint
and the memorial to the death of Christ and the fellowship with Christ for the
believer in the Church Age. Acts 2:46.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Day by day continuing with one mind in the temple, and
breaking bread from house to house, they were taking their meals together with
gladness and sincerity of heart,&quot;  (Acts 2:46, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 20:7, the breaking of bread as the Church Age
progressed became a definite part of organized worship as stated on the first
day of the week. The breaking of bread in Acts 27:34-36 has within the context
the thought of nourishment based on security.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;On the first day of the week, when we were gathered
together to break bread, Paul began talking to them, intending to leave the
next day, and he prolonged his message until midnight.&quot;  (Acts 20:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Therefore I encourage you to take some food, for
this is for your preservation, for not a hair from the head of any of you will
perish.&quot; Having said this, he took bread and gave thanks to God in the
presence of all, and he broke it and began to eat. All of them were encouraged
and they themselves also took food.&quot;  (Acts 27:34-36, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 10:16, the breaking of bread now has
adopted the spiritual meaning as we know it today in communion. In 1
Corinthians 11:20-21, the normal sharing of a meal together is set distinctly
different from the breaking of bread in communion.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Is not the cup of blessing which we bless a sharing in
the blood of Christ? Is not the bread which we break a sharing in the body of
Christ?&quot;  (1 Corinthians 10:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore when you meet together, it is not to eat the
Lord's Supper, for in your eating each one takes his own supper first; and one
is hungry and another is drunk.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 11:20-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 6:4, they continued devoted to prayer. “Prayer”
is <span lang=EL>προσευχη</span>́ (proseuchē) and is a word of sacred
character being limited to prayer to God. It gives prominence to devotion.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the
ministry of the word.&quot;&quot;  (Acts 6:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Philippians 1:19, “prayers” is <span lang=EL>δε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ησις</span> (deēsis) and has the significance of need or indigence - a
condition of poverty. Prayer is a seeking, asking, entreating. It is also used
of requests addressed to man. It gives prominence to the expression of personal
need. It is used of imploring God in regard to a particular matter. Luke 1:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;for I know that this will turn out for my deliverance
through your prayers and the provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,&quot; 
(Philippians 1:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But the angel said to him, &quot;Do not be afraid,
Zacharias, for your petition has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear
you a son, and you will give him the name John.&quot;  (Luke 1:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They were together and shared their common conditions. In
Acts 2:44, ἐπί τό αὐτός (epi to autos) is an idiom also occurring in Acts
1:15 and meaning “all together.” This would be an emphasis on the assembling of
believers together.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And all those who had believed were together and had all
things in common;&quot;  (Acts 2:44, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;At this time Peter stood up in the midst of the brethren
(a gathering of about one hundred and twenty persons was there together), and
said,&quot;  (Acts 1:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They continued daily with one accord in the temple. The
participle is the same as in Acts 2:42 for “continued.” In Acts 2:46, “daily”
is the preposition of norm and standard κατά (kata) with ἡμέρα (hēmera) and
means day to day. The temple was the place of evangelizing as well as
exhortation.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;They were continually devoting themselves to the
apostles' teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to
prayer.&quot;  (Acts 2:42, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Day by day continuing with one mind in the temple, and
breaking bread from house to house, they were taking their meals together with
gladness and sincerity of heart,” (Acts 2:46, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 2:46, “breaking of bread” is same as before, the
present active participle. “From house to house” is <span lang=EL>κατ</span><span
lang=EL> </span><span lang=EL>οι</span>̓͂<span lang=EL>κος</span> (kat oikos)
and is a classic idiom. This differs from the normal perpendicular significance
of the up and down idea of <i>kata</i>. This is the horizontal usage of things
being on the same plane. This emphasizes the common platitude upon which they
measured their homes or status. There was no status rank system in their mental
attitudes toward their homes. The breaking of bread here was not that of
holding communion in various places, but the normal eating and having meals on
a common basis.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The “taking” is <span lang=EL>μεταλαμβα</span>́<span
lang=EL>νω</span> (metalambanō) and means to partake of food or nourishment.
“Gladness” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>γαλλι</span>́<span lang=EL>ασις</span>
(agalliasis) and means in extreme joy, gladness, exultation. “Sincerity of
heart” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>φελο</span>́<span lang=EL>της</span>
(aphelotēs) and means with simplicity, singleness. This is the proper mental
attitude.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The priorities of a local church as it moved into
adolescence and maturity.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The priority of a local church is utilizing all the
spiritual gifts for smooth function. In Acts 6:3, the word “select” is <span
lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>πισκε</span>́<span lang=EL>πτομαι</span>
(episkeptomai) and is the first aorist middle imperative and means to look for
one to employ, to look for, to inspect, to examine.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Therefore, brethren, select from among you seven
men of good reputation, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may put in
charge of this task.&quot;  (Acts 6:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The phrase “whom we may put in charge” is <span lang=EL>ο</span>̔́<span
lang=EL>ς</span><span lang=EL> </span><span lang=EL>καθι</span>́<span lang=EL>στημι</span>
(hos kathistēmi) and means to set one over, to place one in charge. The
ministry of the apostles was such that they could not function as the leaders
of the local church and therefore the local church needed its own leadership.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Function of the Seven Leadership Spiritual Gifts in
the Local Church</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is very interesting that we have arrived at seven
leadership spiritual gifts for the Church Age as to permanent functioning ones.
They are pastor-teacher, evangelism, teacher, administration, exhortation, service,
and giving. This would be parallel to the 1 Timothy 3 passage where the office
of deacon is inclusive of more than just the administration gift.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Acts 6:1-3 is usually ascribed to the singular function
of deacons in the administrative capacity in freeing the pastor for his work,
but a close look will show the context of leadership established in a local
church to free the apostles to do their work.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now at this time while the disciples were increasing in
number, a complaint arose on the part of the Hellenistic Jews against the
native Hebrews, because their widows were being overlooked in the daily serving
of food. So the twelve summoned the congregation of the disciples and said,
&quot;It is not desirable for us to neglect the word of God in order to serve
tables. &quot;Therefore, brethren, select from among you seven men of good
reputation, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may put in charge of this
task.&quot;  (Acts 6:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The phrase “of this task” plus “serve tables” yields the
following truths when viewed together. In Acts 6:2, “serve tables” is the
present active infinitive (purpose) of <span lang=EL>διακονε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span><span lang=EL> </span><span lang=EL>τρα</span>́<span lang=EL>πεζα</span>
(diakoneō trapeza) and means to minister to one, to minister supply food and
the necessities of life, to relieve one’s necessities by collecting alms, to
provide, take care of, distribute, the things necessary to sustain life. It
means to serve or wait at a table and offer food and drink to the guests. It is
not the purpose of the apostles to leave the Word of God and serve tables. Matt.
25:44; Rom. 15:25; Acts 6:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;Then they themselves also will answer, 'Lord, when
did we see You hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in
prison, and did not take care of You?' &quot;  (Matthew 25:44, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;but now, I am going to Jerusalem serving the
saints.&quot;  (Romans 15:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So the twelve summoned the congregation of the disciples
and said, &quot;It is not desirable for us to neglect the word of God in order
to serve tables.&quot;  (Acts 6:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 10:40, “serve” is <span lang=EL>διακονε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span><span lang=EL> </span>(diakoneō) and means to put food on
tables, satisfying of human needs. The ministry of the apostles was a spiritual
one, not one of mechanics, satisfying human needs, etc.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But Martha was distracted with all her preparations; and
she came up to Him and said, &quot;Lord, do You not care that my sister has
left me to do all the serving alone? Then tell her to help me.&quot;&quot; 
(Luke 10:40, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is an analogy here between the apostles to the
multitudes compared to the pastor-teacher to the local church. The apostles did
many things, then came to their priority. It is the same with the
pastor-teacher where he does many things, then comes to his major priority. The
phrase “of this task” in Acts 6:3 is <span lang=EL>ου</span>̔͂<span lang=EL>τος</span><span
lang=EL> </span><span lang=EL>χρει</span>́<span lang=EL>α</span> (houtos
chreia) and is translated “duties” or business, which broadens their
responsibilities beyond the singular need in context to include all the duties
and functions of a local church. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Therefore, brethren, select from among you seven
men of good reputation, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may put in
charge of this task.&quot;  (Acts 6:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If you take the narrow context of the “need of dispersing
money” then you would relate this to a narrow function of the administrative
gift, for example, on a deacon board. But taking this in the broad sense of
duties and business, this includes all the functioning spiritual gifts within a
local church, not just the seven leadership spiritual gifts.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In order for the apostles to follow through on their
immediate priorities, the local church had to assume all its immediate
priorities. Likewise, in order for a pastor in a local church to fulfill his
immediate priorities, the deacon board must by the same token assume their
immediate priorities.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Therefore, when a local church moves into a spiritually
maturing period, the role of the pastor-teacher becomes such that the board
must assume much more responsibility for spiritual gift function than it had previously.
At the outset, the pastor-teacher did many things, but now the board assumes
more and more of the details to allow the pastor-teacher to function in his
newly acquired responsibilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 6:4, the priority of the apostles is analogous to
the priorities of the pastor-teacher. This passage does not say “the teaching
of the Word,” but rather “the ministry of the Word” which means here in context
to minister a thing unto one, to serve someone with or by supplying anything
that would benefit that person. This would include all factors necessary to the
teaching of God’s Word, such as study, preparation, etc. This is a much broader
term than simply the act of teaching. This is much broader than just the
communication of the Word.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the
ministry of the word.&quot;&quot;  (Acts 6:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The second major priority of a growing local church is
stabilization in the spiritual growth process with Bible doctrine. The first
priority frees the pastor-teacher to pursue his second priority. Acts 15:30-36;
Acts 16:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So when they were sent away, they went down to Antioch;
and having gathered the congregation together, they delivered the letter. When
they had read it, they rejoiced because of its encouragement. Judas and Silas,
also being prophets themselves, encouraged and strengthened the brethren with a
lengthy message. After they had spent time there, they were sent away from the
brethren in peace to those who had sent them out. [But it seemed good to Silas
to remain there.] But Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch, teaching and
preaching with many others also, the word of the Lord. After some days Paul
said to Barnabas, &quot;Let us return and visit the brethren in every city in
which we proclaimed the word of the Lord, and see how they are.&quot;&quot; 
(Acts 15:30-36, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So the churches were being strengthened in the faith, and
were increasing in number daily.&quot;  (Acts 16:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 11:22-23, Barnabas encouraged the church at
Antioch. The word “encourage” is <span lang=EL>παρακαλε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(parakaleō) and means to encourage, challenge, motivate, warn, etc. The phrase
“remain true” is <span lang=EL>προσμε</span>́<span lang=EL>νω</span>
(prosmenō) and means to be steadfastly devoted to the Lord, to keep your eyes
on the Lord, foremost before you.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The news about them reached the ears of the church at
Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas off to Antioch. Then when he arrived and
witnessed the grace of God, he rejoiced and began to encourage them all with
resolute heart to remain true to the Lord;&quot;  (Acts 11:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 14:21-22, “strengthening” is <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span
lang=EL>πιστηρι</span>́<span lang=EL>ζω</span> (epistērizō) and means
confirming, exhorting, preparing for increasing pressures, to strengthen more,
to render more firm in their Christian faith. The phrase “to continue” is <span
lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>μμε</span>́<span lang=EL>νω</span> (emmenō) and
means to continue in doctrine, the body of faith.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;After they had preached the gospel to that city and had
made many disciples, they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch,
strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the
faith, and saying, &quot;Through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of
God.&quot;&quot;  (Acts 14:21-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This word is also used in Acts 18:23, Acts 15:32, and
Acts 15:41 in the present active participle. This is a continual principle in a
growing congregation. In Acts 15:32, “encouraged” is <span lang=EL>παρακαλε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (parakaleō) and means to exhort, challenge, and encourage. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And having spent some time there, he left and passed
successively through the Galatian region and Phrygia, strengthening all the
disciples.&quot;  (Acts 18:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Judas and Silas, also being prophets themselves,
encouraged and strengthened the brethren with a lengthy message.&quot;  (Acts
15:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And he was traveling through Syria and Cilicia,
strengthening the churches.&quot;  (Acts 15:41, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>A Closer Look at Barnabas</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Barnabas was the son of consolation, exhortation, and
encouragement. When other disciples were afraid of Paul, Barnabas encouraged
them and brought them to Paul to allay their fears. Acts 4:36; Acts 9:26-27.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now Joseph, a Levite of Cyprian birth, who was also
called Barnabas by the apostles (which translated means Son of
Encouragement),&quot;  (Acts 4:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When he came to Jerusalem, he was trying to associate
with the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was
a disciple. But Barnabas took hold of him and brought him to the apostles and
described to them how he had seen the Lord on the road, and that He had talked
to him, and how at Damascus he had spoken out boldly in the name of
Jesus.&quot;  (Acts 9:26-27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When the Antioch church had grown and multiplied greatly,
the Jerusalem church decided to send someone to minister to them. They sent
Barnabas with the gift of exhortation to fulfill this function. Acts 11:21-22.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a large
number who believed turned to the Lord. The news about them reached the ears of
the church at Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas off to Antioch.&quot;  (Acts
11:21-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When the timing was right to get Paul and bring him to
Antioch for a ministry, it was Barnabas who came through again. When the church
at Antioch was led into their missions ministry, it was Barnabas that was sent
with the Apostle Paul. This gift of exhortation works well with a
pastor-teacher and with individuals as well as groups. Acts 11:25; Acts 13:1-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And he left for Tarsus to look for Saul;&quot;  (Acts
11:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now there were at Antioch, in the church that was there,
prophets and teachers: Barnabas, and Simeon who was called Niger, and Lucius of
Cyrene, and Manaen who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
While they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said,
&quot;Set apart for Me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called
them.&quot; Then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them,
they sent them away. So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to
Seleucia and from there they sailed to Cyprus.&quot;  (Acts 13:1-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When the legalism issue came up in the Jerusalem council,
it was Barnabas that was picked to accompany Paul. The gift of exhortation in
Barnabas exhibited a blind spot of being influenced by others. When the issue
of extending grace to a fallen brother occurred, Barnabas, not Paul, was the
one to stand behind John Mark. Barnabas had a great deal of patience and was
positive in outlook. Acts 15:1-2; Acts 15:39.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Some men came down from Judea and began teaching the
brethren, &quot;Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses,
you cannot be saved.&quot; And when Paul and Barnabas had great dissension and
debate with them, the brethren determined that Paul and Barnabas and some
others of them should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders concerning
this issue.&quot;  (Acts 15:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And there occurred such a sharp disagreement that they
separated from one another, and Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to
Cyprus.&quot;  (Acts 15:39, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Barnabas got caught up in a legalism problem with Peter
at Antioch before the Jerusalem council, but had responded to the admonition of
Paul and was straightened out when the circumcision issue arose. The Antioch
church benefitted from the encouragement ministry of Judas and Silas. Gal. 2:1;
Acts 15:32.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then after an interval of fourteen years I went up again
to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along also.&quot;  (Galatians 2:1,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Judas and Silas, also being prophets themselves,
encouraged and strengthened the brethren with a lengthy message.&quot;  (Acts
15:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul and Silas went through Syria and Cilicia encouraging
and strengthening the churches. In Acts 15:41, “strengthening” is <span
lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>πιστηρι</span>́<span lang=EL>ζω</span>
(epistērizō) and means to make solid, strong, make firm, strengthen. In Acts
16:5 and Acts 18:23, “being strengthened” and “strengthening” are <span
lang=EL>στερεο</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (stereoō) and <span lang=EL>στηρι</span>́<span
lang=EL>ζω</span> (stērizō) and both mean to strengthen, make firm, to render
constant and to confirm one’s mind.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And he was traveling through Syria and Cilicia,
strengthening the churches.&quot;  (Acts 15:41, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So the churches were being strengthened in the faith, and
were increasing in number daily.&quot;  (Acts 16:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And having spent some time there, he left and passed
successively through the Galatian region and Phrygia, strengthening all the
disciples.&quot;  (Acts 18:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Principles of Application</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Local churches are often misunderstood by members or
attendees who do not understand the priorities of the local church at that time
or for a certain point in time. Nothing remains static for a local church. The
leadership of the local church needs to understand the trends and stages that
the church is going through.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The leadership of the local church needs to communicate
to the congregation what are the immediate priorities and the future priorities
of the local church. The leadership will communicate this first from the text
and secondly from the policy adopted.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For a local church to carry out its priorities, the
function of all the leadership spiritual gifts must be exercised. When
individuals fail in their priorities, then the local church is curtailed in
realizing their priorities.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A realization of priorities does not eliminate the
possibility and need for flexibility. For example, it is understood that the
priorities of the pastor include studying, teaching, troubleshooting, and leadership
in the family. But that does not exclude socializing, fellowship, recreation,
etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We must learn to respect the priorities of others, but at
the same time be free to exercise ourselves to them. The priorities of
individual believers go through spiritual growth stages just like the local
church does. The new believer has certain priorities, as does the growing
believer and the mature believer.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer must recognize the growth distinctions
within other believers and not judge them because they don’t seem to have the
same priorities that they have. Priorities are designed to guide you not
destroy you. They cannot become a legalism system of regimentation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Priorities fall into two categories: the spiritual
priorities and the divine institution priorities. Due to the above principle,
the believer is responsible for the harmonizing of these priorities to keep a
balance in life. At certain stages, one category of priorities may be more
predominant than the other. There are times that the spiritual priorities
almost seem to wipe out the divine institution priorities. Other times, the
divine institution priorities seem to be greatly curtailing your spiritual priorities.
But, as you stay with it, time will balance out the two categories.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are times when certain spiritual gifts are
prominent to accomplish certain priorities of a local church. To accomplish the
priority of spiritual growth and stabilization, the gift of pastor-teacher is
vital. To accomplish the priority of training men for the ministry, the local
church needs the gift of pastor-teacher. To teach the children, the gift of
teacher is needed. To accomplish the priority of evangelism, the local church
needs the gift of evangelism. To accomplish the priority of an expanded ministry,
the gift of administration is vital.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When the congregation increases, the potential for
problems, misunderstandings, and questions increases. The church gets away from
the people. They say, “This isn’t the church we used to know, love or enjoy.”
“It’s moving too fast and I’m not sure if I can keep up or get used to it.”
This calls for the gift of exhortation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The gift of exhortation is able to convey the proper
encouragement and the proper exhortation to solve and avoid problems before
they occur and while they are still building. The gift of exhortation has the
following characteristics. It is not afraid or intimidated by the countenance
or status of the person or group to which it ministers. It is a much needed
gift in a local church to balance instruction with encouragement. Acts 9:26-27;
Acts 11:21-22.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When he came to Jerusalem, he was trying to associate
with the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was
a disciple. But Barnabas took hold of him and brought him to the apostles and
described to them how he had seen the Lord on the road, and that He had talked
to him, and how at Damascus he had spoken out boldly in the name of
Jesus.&quot;  (Acts 9:26-27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a large
number who believed turned to the Lord. The news about them reached the ears of
the church at Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas off to Antioch.&quot;  (Acts
11:21-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It has vital sensitivity to the timing factor. There was
a right time for Paul to return to Antioch. Barnabas knew this and brought him
back. It works well with other communication leadership gifts. Acts 11:25; Acts
13:1-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And he left for Tarsus to look for Saul;&quot;  (Acts
11:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now there were at Antioch, in the church that was there,
prophets and teachers: Barnabas, and Simeon who was called Niger, and Lucius of
Cyrene, and Manaen who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
While they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said,
&quot;Set apart for Me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called
them.&quot; Then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them,
they sent them away. So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to
Seleucia and from there they sailed to Cyprus.&quot;  (Acts 13:1-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It works well with individuals as well as with groups. It
has blind spots to certain influences of others. Barnabas was influenced by the
legalism antic of Peter and fell into it. Acts 11:25; Gal. 2:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then after an interval of fourteen years I went up again
to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along also.&quot;  (Galatians 2:1,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It has a particular characteristic of patient optimism.
It not only goes the second mile in help, but the third and the fourth as well.
An example is Barnabas and John Mark in Acts 15:36-39. Its function of
exhorting and encouraging is directly related to stability in the local church.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;After some days Paul said to Barnabas, &quot;Let us
return and visit the brethren in every city in which we proclaimed the word of
the Lord, and see how they are.&quot; Barnabas wanted to take John, called
Mark, along with them also. But Paul kept insisting that they should not take
him along who had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not gone with them to the
work. And there occurred such a sharp disagreement that they separated from one
another, and Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus.&quot;
