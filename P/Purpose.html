<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Bible doctrine is designed to not only give knowledge,
but also purpose and discretion. In Proverbs 2:11, “discretion” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>מזמּה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> (mezimmâh) and means a reasoned wisdom and deliberation, a
final result of deliberation, a resolve, the power of devising, the mechanics
of purpose, a project, a plan. <i>Mezimmâh</i> means not just an inclination,
but strongly an inclination by decided thought, a real calculated decision, a
purpose. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Discretion will guard you, Understanding will watch over
you,&quot;  (Proverbs 2:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The power of purpose gives preservation to the believer
from the evil man and the strange woman. Functioning under the decided purpose
of God brings happiness, a working together for good. Prov. 1:4; Rom. 8:28. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;To give prudence to the naive, To the youth knowledge and
discretion,&quot;  (Proverbs 1:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And we know that God causes all things to work together
for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His
purpose.&quot;  (Romans 8:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer is challenged to guard jealously their
purposes. The believer’s knowledge of doctrine is to correlate with their
purposes. Prov. 3:21; Prov. 5:2; Prov. 8:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;My son, let them not vanish from your sight; Keep sound
wisdom and discretion,&quot;  (Proverbs 3:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;That you may observe discretion And your lips may reserve
knowledge.&quot;  (Proverbs 5:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;I, wisdom, dwell with prudence, And I find
knowledge and discretion.&quot;  (Proverbs 8:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Human purposes and desires do not compare in value to
wisdom. “Desire” in Proverbs 3:15 is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>חפץ</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (chêphets)
and means desire, pleasure. Human purposes and desires do not compare in value
to wisdom. “Desirable” in Proverbs 8:11 is also <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>חפץ</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span>
(chêphets).</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;She is more precious than jewels; And nothing you desire
compares with her.&quot;  (Proverbs 3:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;For wisdom is better than jewels; And all desirable
things cannot compare with her.&quot;  (Proverbs 8:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Purposes have within them an enjoyment, a pleasure. The
purposes of God are solid, stable, permanent. Our purposes, as imitators of
God, are to be also solid, stable, permanent. What are our purposes? Are they
weak and flimsy, easily changed? Isaiah 44:28; Isaiah 46:1-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot; It is I who says of Cyrus, ' He is My shepherd!
And he will perform all My desire.' And he declares of Jerusalem, 'She will be
built,' And of the temple, 'Your foundation will be laid.'&quot;&quot;  (Isaiah
44:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Listen to Me, O house of Jacob, And all the remnant
of the house of Israel, You who have been borne by Me from birth And have been
carried from the womb; Even to your old age I will be the same, And even to
your graying years I will bear you! I have done it, and I will carry you; And I
will bear you and I will deliver you. &quot;  (Isaiah 46:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Remember the former things long past, For I am God,
and there is no other; I am God, and there is no one like Me, Declaring the end
from the beginning, And from ancient times things which have not been done,
Saying, 'My purpose will be established, And I will accomplish all My good
pleasure';&quot;  (Isaiah 46:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Performance in purposes is important. It is one thing to
make plans, but another thing to carry them out. In Isaiah 48:14, purposes are
made while shutting out interfering things. In Proverbs 16:30, we have it used
of the evil man, but the principle is there. To see doctrine clearly in the
making of purpose, one must shut out all else. “Perverse” is in the qal stem in
Hebrew of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>תּהפּכה</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (tahpûkâh).</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Assemble, all of you, and listen! Who among them
has declared these things? The LORD loves him; he will carry out His good
pleasure on Babylon, And His arm will be against the Chaldeans.&quot;  (Isaiah
48:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He who winks his eyes does so to devise perverse things;
He who compresses his lips brings evil to pass.&quot;  (Proverbs 16:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 16:9, the piel stem is used in Hebrew and
means that purposes must be firmly established in the heart, but the Lord has
to direct the believer in bringing them to fruition and that He does one step
at a time. Just as there are correct purposes, there are evil purposes. In
Proverbs 24:8, is the purpose to do evil. This is the old sin nature distortion
of a biblical concept.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The mind of man plans his way, But the LORD directs his
steps.&quot;  (Proverbs 16:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;One who plans to do evil, Men will call a schemer.&quot; 
(Proverbs 24:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s plan overrides the purposes or intentions of man.
”Intention” in Acts 27:43 is <span lang=EL>βου</span>́<span lang=EL>λημα</span>
(boulēma) in the Greek and also means will, counsel, or purpose. God’s
purposes are not to be challenged. This is the same Greek term as in Acts
27:43. Rom. 9:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;but the centurion, wanting to bring Paul safely through,
kept them from their intention, and commanded that those who could swim should
jump overboard first and get to land,&quot;  (Acts 27:43, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;You will say to me then, &quot;Why does He still find
fault? For who resists His will?&quot;&quot;  (Romans 9:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The plan of God is based on God’s purpose. Paul had made
known his purpose to Timothy. 2 Tim. 1:9; 2 Tim. 3:10-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not
according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace which was
granted us in Christ Jesus from all eternity,&quot;  (2 Timothy 1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now you followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith,
patience, love, perseverance, persecutions, and sufferings, such as happened to
me at Antioch, at Iconium and at Lystra; what persecutions I endured, and out
of them all the Lord rescued me!&quot;  (2 Timothy 3:10-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 1:13, “planned” is <span lang=EL>προτι</span>́<span
lang=EL>θεμαι</span> (protithemai) and means to purpose or determine. Purposes
determined do not always come to completion or realization.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I do not want you to be unaware, brethren, that often I
have planned to come to you (and have been prevented so far) so that I may
obtain some fruit among you also, even as among the rest of the
Gentiles.&quot;  (Romans 1:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 31:16, “considers” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>זמם</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span>
(zâmam) and means to fix thoughts upon, to purpose, devise. It is used of a
woman fixing thoughts upon a product with the result that she buys it.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;She considers a field and buys it; From her earnings she
plants a vineyard.&quot;  (Proverbs 31:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 19:21, “plans” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>מחשׁבה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> (machăshâbâh) and means devices, purposes. Although man has
many human viewpoint and sinful purposes, God’s purposes shall stand firm. The
plans and purposes of the diligent result in plenty, but the lack of the same
results in want.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Many plans are in a man's heart, But the counsel of the
LORD will stand.&quot;  (Proverbs 19:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The plans of the diligent lead surely to advantage, But
everyone who is hasty comes surely to poverty.&quot;  (Proverbs 21:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Daniel 11:17, “set” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שׂוּם</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> (śûm) and means determination of purpose and is used in the
evil sense, but accurately describing the intensity of the purpose. 1 Kings
2:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;He will set his face to come with the power of his
whole kingdom, bringing with him a proposal of peace which he will put into
effect; he will also give him the daughter of women to ruin it. But she will
not take a stand for him or be on his side.&quot;  (Daniel 11:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So he said, &quot;You know that the kingdom was mine and
that all Israel expected me to be king; however, the kingdom has turned about
and become my brother's, for it was his from the LORD.&quot;  (1 Kings 2:15,
NASB)</p>
