<h2><a name="_Special_Pastor-Teachers’_Class"></a><a name="_The_Spiritual_Gift"></a><a
name="_Extreme_Hazards_For"></a>Pastor-Teacher, Ministry Hazards</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The ministry hazard of negative volition is found in Acts
20:30, where “speaking perverse things” is the present active participle of <span
lang=EL>λαλε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (laleō) and plus the perfect
passive participle of <span lang=EL>διαστρε</span>́<span lang=EL>φω</span>
(diastrephō) which mean to speak of things that are distorted, perverted,
corrupt, or twisted.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and from among your own selves men will arise, speaking
perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them.&quot;  (Acts 20:30,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The ministry hazard of immaturity is found in 1 Timothy
3:6, where “not a new convert” is <span lang=EL>νεοφυτος</span> from <span
lang=EL>νεος</span> (new) and <span lang=EL>φυω</span> (to bring forth,
produce) and means newly-planted, a new convert, neophyte, a novice. These are
words for immaturity, green behind the ears, not dry there. “Conceited” is <span
lang=EL>τυφο</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (tuphoō) and means slain by pride, blind
with pride or conceit, to render foolish or stupid. This can be carnal success
or stupid failure. It can go either way.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and not a new convert, so that he will not become
conceited and fall into the condemnation incurred by the devil.&quot;  (1
Timothy 3:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The ministry hazard of not knowing the original languages
is found in 2 Timothy 3:16-17. It is impossible to be accurate without them. It
is impossible to be dogmatic without them. It is impossible to be authoritative
without them. 2 Tim. 2:15; 2 Tim. 4:2; 2 Tim. 4:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for
teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; so that
the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.&quot;  (2 Timothy
3:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a
workman who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of
truth.&quot;  (2 Timothy 2:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;preach the word; be ready in season and out of season;
reprove, rebuke, exhort, with great patience and instruction.&quot;  (2 Timothy
4:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course,
I have kept the faith;&quot;  (2 Timothy 4:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The ministry hazard of no self-discipline means you have
no mastery of the details of life. The laziest men in the world are included in
the clergy. The most disciplined men in the world are included in the
pastor-teacher ranks. Since there are no time clocks to punch and no one is
standing over you, you must have the ability to provide your own discipline.
Your time should have four priorities: study, teach, troubleshoot, and family.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Priority 1 – To Study. To “study” is the aorist active
imperative of <span lang=EL>σπουδα</span>́<span lang=EL>ζω</span> (spoudazō)
and means to exert one’s self, endeavor, give diligence. Pastor-teacher Timothy
was commanded to study in 2 Timothy 2:15. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a
workman who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of
truth.&quot;  (2 Timothy 2:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Priority 2 – To Teach. In 2 Timothy 4:2, to “teach” is
the aorist active imperative of <span lang=EL>κηρυ</span>́<span lang=EL>σσω</span>
(kērussō) and means to preach, to be a herald always with the suggestion of
formality, gravity and an authority who must be listened to and obeyed. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;preach the word; be ready in season and out of season;
reprove, rebuke, exhort, with great patience and instruction.&quot;  (2 Timothy
4:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Priority 3 – To Troubleshoot. In 2 Timothy 4:2, to “troubleshoot”
includes “to reprove” and is the aorist active imperative of <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span
lang=EL>λε</span>́<span lang=EL>γχω</span> (elegchō) and means to find fault
with, to correct, to reprehend severely, chide, admonish, reprove.
Troubleshooting also includes “to rebuke” and is the aorist active imperative
of <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>πιτιμα</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(epitimaō). Troubleshooting also includes “to exhort” and is the aorist active
imperative of <span lang=EL>παρακαλε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (parakaleō)
and emphasizes using authority to get across a point. Christ rebuked the evil
spirits, wind, fever, and His disciples. Mark 8:33; Luke 9:55.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;preach the word; be ready in season and out of season;
reprove, rebuke, exhort, with great patience and instruction.&quot;  (2 Timothy
4:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But turning around and seeing His disciples, He rebuked
Peter and said, &quot;Get behind Me, Satan; for you are not setting your mind
on God's interests, but man's.&quot;&quot;  (Mark 8:33, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But He turned and rebuked them, [and said, &quot;You do
not know what kind of spirit you are of;&quot;  (Luke 9:55, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Priority 4 – Family. The priority of family involves all
aspects of managing your household. In 1 Timothy 3:4-5, “manages” is the
present middle imperative of <span lang=EL>προι</span>̈́́<span lang=EL>στημι</span>
(proistēmi) and means to rule, to stand before, to lead, to attend to with
care and diligence. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He must be one who manages his own household well,
keeping his children under control with all dignity (but if a man does not know
how to manage his own household, how will he take care of the church of
God?),&quot;  (1 Timothy 3:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The ministry hazard of not being prepared is found in 2
Timothy 2:15 as “Be diligent” and is the aorist active imperative of <span
lang=EL>σπουδα</span>́<span lang=EL>ζω</span> (spoudazō) and is the principle
of daily study and daily teaching. In 2 Corinthians 4:1 and 2 Corinthians 4:16,
we have the principle of “we do not lose heart” <span lang=EL>διο</span><span
lang=EL> </span><span lang=EL>ουκ</span><span lang=EL> </span><span lang=EL>εγκαλουμεν</span>
and is the present active indicative of <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>γκακε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (egkakeō) and means to lack courage, to grow weary, to lose
heart (volition). Eph. 3:13; 2 Thess. 3:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a
workman who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of
truth.&quot;  (2 Timothy 2:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore, since we have this ministry, as we received
mercy, we do not lose heart,&quot;  (2 Corinthians 4:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore we do not lose heart, but though our outer man
is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day.&quot;  (2
Corinthians 4:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore I ask you not to lose heart at my tribulations
on your behalf, for they are your glory.&quot;  (Ephesians 3:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But as for you, brethren, do not grow weary of doing
good.&quot;  (2 Thessalonians 3:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 4:16, we see the principle of the “outer
man is decaying.” “Decaying” is the present passive indicative of <span
lang=EL>διαφθει</span>́<span lang=EL>ρω</span> (diaphtheirō) and means to
corrupt, to decay, to deteriorate, day by day deterioration. The principle of
the “inner man is being renewed” is the present passive indicative of <span
lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>νακαινο</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(anakainoō) and means daily renewal, to make new-upon, again. It is the
antonym of <i>diaphtheirō</i>. This is the key meaning to the passage.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The principle of daily speaking is found in 2 Corinthians
4:13. “I believed, therefore I spoke” is the aorist active indicative of <span
lang=EL>πιστευ</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (pisteuō) and <span lang=EL>λαλε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (laleō) and “we also believe, therefore we also speak” is the
present active indicative of <span lang=EL>πιστευ</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(pisteuō) and <span lang=EL>λαλε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (laleō).</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But having the same spirit of faith, according to what is
written, &quot;I BELIEVED, THEREFORE I SPOKE,&quot; we also believe, therefore
we also speak,&quot;  (2 Corinthians 4:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 10:25, “no forsaking” is the present active
participle of <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>γκαταλει</span>́<span
lang=EL>πω</span> (egkataleipō) and means to forsake, to abandon, to leave.
“Assembling” is <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>πισυναγωγη</span>́
(episunagōgē) and refers to believers gathering for public teaching of Bible
doctrine. “Encouraging” is the present active participle of <span lang=EL>παρακαλε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (parakaleō).</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the
habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more as you see the day
drawing near.&quot;  (Hebrews 10:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The principle of daily speaking is also found in Matthew
6:11 as “daily bread.” In Matthew 4:4, “proceeds” is the present active
participle of <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>κπορευ</span>́<span lang=EL>ομαι</span>
(ekporeuomai) and means to come or go forth. Daily speaking is also found in
Acts 2:47 as “added to the church daily.” In Acts 16:5, we also have daily
teaching. In Acts 17:11, “daily” is the present active participle of <span
lang=EL>η</span>̔<span lang=EL>με</span>́<span lang=EL>ρα</span> (hēmera) and
refers to daily study.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;'Give us this day our daily bread.&quot;  (Matthew 6:11,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But He answered and said, &quot;It is written, 'MAN SHALL
NOT LIVE ON BREAD ALONE, BUT ON EVERY WORD THAT PROCEEDS OUT OF THE MOUTH OF
GOD.'&quot;&quot;  (Matthew 4:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;praising God and having favor with all the people. And
the Lord was adding to their number day by day those who were being
saved.&quot;  (Acts 2:47, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So the churches were being strengthened in the faith, and
were increasing in number daily.&quot;  (Acts 16:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now these were more noble-minded than those in
Thessalonica, for they received the word with great eagerness, examining the
Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so.&quot;  (Acts 17:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The ministry hazard of<b> </b>not having a completed
edification complex of the soul is a serious hazard. Also, not being grace
oriented is a definite hazard. You cannot have any illusions about yourself or
about others. You must learn to master of the details of life. 1 Cor. 15:10; 2
Cor. 4:8-13; 2 Cor. 11:23 through 1 Cor. 12:21; Phil. 4:10-19.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace
toward me did not prove vain; but I labored even more than all of them, yet not
I, but the grace of God with me.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 15:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“we are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but
not despairing; persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed;
always carrying about in the body the dying of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus
also may be manifested in our body. For we who live are constantly being
delivered over to death for Jesus' sake, so that the life of Jesus also may be
manifested in our mortal flesh. So death works in us, but life in you. But
having the same spirit of faith, according to what is written, &quot;I
BELIEVED, THEREFORE I SPOKE,&quot; we also believe, therefore we also speak,”
(2 Corinthians 4:8-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You must maintain your priorities of study, teach,
troubleshoot, and family. You must learn to balance activities and not be lazy,
but not to be over-active either. You need to know when to vacation and when
not to vacation. You have to maintain a relaxed mental attitude. You should
know you are in trouble when you have no sense of humor, you are uptight,
impatient, irritable, pushy, critical, full of self-pity, unsettled,
pessimistic, and have a guilt-complex about something you should have done or
failed to do. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>How do you treat your wife? What is your attitude around
the home in general? Do you malign your deacons or your congregation around
your home? Are you always looking for greener pastures? Do you feel that
nothing is happening or that you are a failure? The answer is always
unconditional <i>agapao</i> love from the filling of the Holy Spirit based on <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine in the right lobe of your soul. Study further the use of <i>agapao</i>
love in Scripture passages. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Another ministry hazard is not having rapport love toward
God, toward your wife, and towards friends. Study the use of <i>phileo</i> love
in Scripture passages.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Another ministry hazard is not being carried by sharing
the perfect happiness of God (+H). Study the book of Philippians. The principle
is that a pastor-teacher must carry his environment around within him. You can
have the attitude as though you are living in the Millennium inside and hell on
earth outside, but you should still be perfectly grace oriented. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The ministry hazard of depression and discouragement is
found in 2 Corinthians 7:5. This is depression and discouragement during a time
of extreme testing. Paul was cast down or pushed down and bent out of shape.
Paul was encouraged by the coming of Titus. This is the value of doctrinal
fellowship. 2 Cor. 7:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For even when we came into Macedonia our flesh had no
rest, but we were afflicted on every side: conflicts without, fears within. But
God, who comforts the depressed, comforted us by the coming of Titus;&quot;  (2
Corinthians 7:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 12:7-10, Paul was encouraged by the Word
of God. Watch your mental attitude closely. James 1:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and not only by his coming, but also by the comfort with
which he was comforted in you, as he reported to us your longing, your
mourning, your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced even more. For though I caused
you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it; though I did regret it—for I see
that that letter caused you sorrow, though only for a while— I now rejoice, not
that you were made sorrowful, but that you were made sorrowful to the point of
repentance; for you were made sorrowful according to the will of God, so that
you might not suffer loss in anything through us. For the sorrow that is
according to the will of God produces a repentance without regret, leading to
salvation, but the sorrow of the world produces death.&quot;  (2 Corinthians
7:7-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter
various trials,&quot;  (James 1:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is also the ministry hazard of marital (family)
problems. The pastor-teacher should have married the one woman God meant for
him. The pastor-teacher must be the spiritual head of his home. The
pastor-teacher must be grace oriented toward his wife. 1 Tim. 3:2; 1 Tim. 3:4-5;
Eph. 5:23; 1 Peter 3:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;An overseer, then, must be above reproach, the husband of
one wife, temperate, prudent, respectable, hospitable, able to teach,&quot;  (1
Timothy 3:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He must be one who manages his own household well,
keeping his children under control with all dignity (but if a man does not know
how to manage his own household, how will he take care of the church of
God?),&quot;  (1 Timothy 3:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also
is the head of the church, He Himself being the Savior of the body.&quot; 
(Ephesians 5:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;You husbands in the same way, live with your wives in an
understanding way, as with someone weaker, since she is a woman; and show her
honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life, so that your prayers will not be
hindered.&quot;  (1 Peter 3:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ephesians 6:4, “provoke not” is the present active
imperative of <span lang=EL>παροργι</span>́<span lang=EL>ζω</span> (parorgizō)
and means to arouse to anger, to embitter. “Bring them up” is the present
active imperative of <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>κτρε</span>́<span
lang=EL>φω</span> (ektrephō). “Discipline” is <span lang=EL>παιδει</span>́<span
lang=EL>α</span> (paideia) and denotes the training of a child including
instruction, hence discipline, correction, chastening. The word suggests the
Christian discipline that regulates character. Heb. 12:5; Heb. 12:7; Heb. 12:8;
2 Tim. 3:16. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring
them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.&quot;  (Ephesians 6:4,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and you have forgotten the exhortation which is addressed
to you as sons, &quot;MY SON, DO NOT REGARD LIGHTLY THE DISCIPLINE OF THE LORD,
NOR FAINT WHEN YOU ARE REPROVED BY HIM;&quot;  (Hebrews 12:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;It is for discipline that you endure; God deals with you
as with sons; for what son is there whom his father does not discipline?&quot; 
(Hebrews 12:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But if you are without discipline, of which all have
become partakers, then you are illegitimate children and not sons.&quot; 
(Hebrews 12:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for
teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness;&quot;  (2
Timothy 3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Another Greek word that is very similar in meaning is <span
lang=EL>νουθεσι</span>́<span lang=EL>α</span> (nouthesia) and is translated
“instruction.” <i>Nouthesia</i> is from <span lang=EL>νους</span> (mind) and <span
lang=EL>τιθημι</span> (to put, i.e., to put in mind). <i>Nouthesia</i> is used
three places in Scripture. In 1 Corinthians 10:11, “instruction” speaks of the
purpose of the Scriptures. In Ephesians 6:4, “instruction” is used for the
parent training the child by the Word of God (Bible doctrine) whether
encouragement or reproof or remonstrance. In Titus 3:10, it is translated
“warning” and refers to the correction of one who creates trouble in the
