<h2>Pastor-Teacher, Relationships</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher’s relationships with other people
including his wife and family should be exemplary and above reproach. In 1
Timothy 3:1, “aspires” is <span lang=EL>ο</span>̓<span lang=EL>ρε</span>́<span
lang=EL>γομαι</span> (oregomai) and means to extend, to stretch out, to stretch
one’s self out, to reach forward, to desire earnestly. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;It is a trustworthy statement: if any man aspires to the
office of overseer, it is a fine work he desires to do.&quot;  (1 Timothy 3:1,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Timothy 3:2, “above reproach” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span
lang=EL>νεπι</span>́<span lang=EL>ληπτος</span> (anepilēptos) and means one
who cannot be seized upon, cannot be reprehended, not open to censure,
irreproachable, one who can’t be carted off to jail. This specifically knocks
out the civil rights ministers. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;An overseer, then, must be above reproach, the husband of
one wife, temperate, prudent, respectable, hospitable, able to teach,&quot;  (1
Timothy 3:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Husband of one wife” means he must have his right woman.
Here we should interject the doctrine of marriage. This is a necessity. The
pastor-teacher must have a doctrinal marriage with the wife that God intended
for him. A marriage to an unbeliever or a wife negative to Bible doctrine will
short-circuit his ministry. This does not mean that a minister must be married!
This verse was written to combat polygamy. With heathenism being rampant at
that time, it was okay to have as many wives as you could afford. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is also not a verse intended to penalize a minister
who has been divorced previous to salvation or after salvation, if the divorce
was biblically legitimate (i.e., adultery - Matt. 5:32 and Matt. 19:9 or
desertion - 1 Cor. 7:15). </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;but I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife,
except for the reason of unchastity, makes her commit adultery; and whoever
marries a divorced woman commits adultery.&quot;  (Matthew 5:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;And I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except
for immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery.&quot;&quot; 
(Matthew 19:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Yet if the unbelieving one leaves, let him leave; the brother
or the sister is not under bondage in such cases, but God has called us to
peace.” (1 Corinthians 7:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Timothy 3:2, “temperate” is <span lang=EL>νηφα</span>́<span
lang=EL>λιος</span> (nēphalios) and means temperate in the use of wine, sober,
not drunken. To sublimate with wine or liquor is not the answer! The
pastor-teacher should never allow himself to get drunk. In some cases, liquor
can be used as in 1 Timothy 5:23. “Prudent” is <span lang=EL>σω</span>́<span
lang=EL>φρων</span> (sōphrōn) and means prudent, thoughtful, self-controlled.
It means soul stability applied. The verb “to be sensible” in Titus 2:6 is <span
lang=EL>σωφρονε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (sōphroneō) and means to be
sound mentally and sound in the right lobe of the soul.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;An overseer, then, must be above reproach, the husband of
one wife, temperate, prudent, respectable, hospitable, able to teach,&quot;  (1
Timothy 3:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;No longer drink water exclusively, but use a little wine
for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments.&quot;  (1 Timothy
5:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Likewise urge the young men to be sensible;&quot;  (Titus
2:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher must be filled with the Holy Spirit
and function under the grace apparatus for perception. He must apply Bible
doctrine for spiritual maturity and stability. In 1 Timothy 3:2, “respectable”
is <span lang=EL>κο</span>́<span lang=EL>σμιος</span> (kosmios) and means well
arranged, seemly, modest. It is translated “proper” in 1 Timothy 2:9 and means
orderly, well-arranged, organized. Punctuality is the mark of a disciplined
person who is master of the details of life. “Hospitable” in 1 Timothy 3:2, is <span
lang=EL>φιλο</span>́<span lang=EL>ξενος</span> (philoxenos) from <span lang=EL>φίλη</span>
(rapport) with <span lang=EL>ξένος</span> (stranger). Titus 1:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Likewise, I want women to adorn themselves with proper
clothing, modestly and discreetly, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or
costly garments,&quot;  (1 Timothy 2:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;but hospitable, loving what is good, sensible, just,
devout, self-controlled,&quot;  (Titus 1:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Peter 4:9, “without complaint” is <span lang=EL>γογγυσμο</span>́<span
lang=EL>ς</span> (goggusmos) and means a private whispering, muttering,
murmuring, an undercurrent, an expression of dissatisfaction. This is a
doctrine that balances out the doctrine of privacy. John 7:12; Phil. 2:14; Acts
6:1. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Be hospitable to one another without complaint.&quot;  (1
Peter 4:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;There was much grumbling among the crowds concerning Him;
some were saying, &quot;He is a good man&quot;; others were saying, &quot;No,
on the contrary, He leads the people astray.&quot;&quot;  (John 7:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Do all things without grumbling or disputing;&quot; 
(Philippians 2:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now at this time while the disciples were increasing in
number, a complaint arose on the part of the Hellenistic Jews against the
native Hebrews, because their widows were being overlooked in the daily serving
of food.&quot;  (Acts 6:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is the attitude Ananias should have had toward the
stranger, Paul in Acts 9:13. This is also the attitude that the Jews in
Jerusalem should have had toward Paul in Acts 9:26. Barnabas had the proper
grace attitude of hospitality <span lang=EL>φιλο</span>́<span lang=EL>ξενος</span>
(philoxenos) toward Paul in Acts 9:27. The pastor-teacher does not approach
another pastor in suspicion, but on the merits of grace. He should discern from
a position of grace thinking.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But Ananias answered, &quot;Lord, I have heard from many
about this man, how much harm he did to Your saints at Jerusalem;&quot;  (Acts
9:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When he came to Jerusalem, he was trying to associate
with the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was
a disciple.&quot;  (Acts 9:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But Barnabas took hold of him and brought him to the
apostles and described to them how he had seen the Lord on the road, and that
He had talked to him, and how at Damascus he had spoken out boldly in the name
of Jesus.&quot;  (Acts 9:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Timothy 3:2, is “able to teach” is <span lang=EL>διδακτικο</span>́<span
lang=EL>ς</span> (didaktikos) and means skillful in teaching, an expert skilled
in public instruction. The spiritual gift carries a high skill in
communication. <i>Didaktikos</i> is also used in 2 Timothy 2:24.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The Lord's bond-servant must not be quarrelsome, but be
kind to all, able to teach, patient when wronged,&quot;  (2 Timothy 2:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is the ability to teach truth systematically,
categorically, and in accordance with the comprehensive ability of the
audience. For the pastor-teacher, this includes all Bible classes, teaching
your own children, and extends to the pastor’s personal relationships with
others.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Titus 1:7, “not addicted to wine” is the negative of <span
lang=EL>πα</span>́<span lang=EL>ροινος</span> (paroinos) and is a compound noun
which says, “Do not sit alongside someone occupied with wine” and means not
addicted to wine, not drunken. Wine was the recognized beverage of that day. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For the overseer must be above reproach as God's steward,
not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not addicted to wine, not pugnacious, not
fond of sordid gain,&quot;  (Titus 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Also in Titus 1:7, “not pugnacious” is <span lang=EL>μη</span><span
lang=EL> </span><span lang=EL>πλη</span>́<span lang=EL>κτης</span> (me
plēktēs) meaning not to strike, to smite, quarrelsome. This is one who goes
around hitting people, actually punching people in the nose. This can be used
in a figurative sense of a pastor bullying his congregation. “Not fond of
sordid gain” is <span lang=EL>αι</span>̓<span lang=EL>σχροκερδη</span>́<span
lang=EL>ς</span> (aischrokerdēs) and means greedy for money. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Timothy 3:3, “but gentle” is <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span
lang=EL>πιεικη</span>́<span lang=EL>ς</span> (epieikēs) meaning gentle,
gracious, forbearing to others. This applies even to the problematic ones in
the pastor’s congregation. “Peaceable” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓́<span
lang=EL>μαχος</span> (amachos) means not a fighter literally and came to mean
not contentious, not a troublemaker. He troubleshoots, but is not a
troublemaker. The troublemaker is someone who is against everything just to
keep things exciting. They always have an issue going, a mess to be sorted,
always rallying people around an issue. They are always fighting issues and
promoting reformation.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;not addicted to wine or pugnacious, but gentle,
peaceable, free from the love of money.&quot;  (1 Timothy 3:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Free from the love of money” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span
lang=EL>φιλα</span>́<span lang=EL>ργυρος</span> (aphilarguros) and is the
negative of <span lang=EL>φίλος</span> (philos) (rapport, fond, affinity) + <span
lang=EL>άργυρος</span> (money). There must be a balance between 1 Timothy 5:8
and 1 Timothy 3:3. The question arises, should someone with the gift of
pastor-teacher take a church where he must work at a secular job to support
himself? For the evangelist, yes. For the pastor-teacher, never. A vindication
of his pastor-teacher gift is being paid by those who he feeds. If the church
cannot pay him, then outside support may have to be raised. In preparation,
either he supports himself or the pastor-teacher who teaches him supports him.
1 Tim. 5:17-18; Acts 20:34. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But if anyone does not provide for his own, and
especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse
than an unbeliever.&quot;  (1 Timothy 5:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The elders who rule well are to be considered worthy of
double honor, especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching. For the
Scripture says, &quot;YOU SHALL NOT MUZZLE THE OX WHILE HE IS THRESHING,&quot;
and &quot;The laborer is worthy of his wages.&quot;&quot;  (1 Timothy 5:17-18,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;You yourselves know that these hands ministered to
my own needs and to the men who were with me.&quot;  (Acts 20:34, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher’s relationship to his family is stated
in 1 Timothy 3:4. “Manages” is the present middle participle of <span lang=EL>προι</span>̈́́<span
lang=EL>στημι</span> (proistēmi) and means to rule, to stand before, to lead,
to take care, to protect. “Well” means good of intrinsic value. He is managing
well his home and family. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He must be one who manages his own household well,
keeping his children under control with all dignity&quot;  (1 Timothy 3:4,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The test of managing well is “keeping his children under
control with all dignity.” The pastor-teacher should command the respect of his
children. 2 Cor. 9:13; Gal. 2:5; 1 Tim. 2:11. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Because of the proof given by this ministry, they will
glorify God for your obedience to your confession of the gospel of Christ and
for the liberality of your contribution to them and to all,&quot;  (2
Corinthians 9:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But we did not yield in subjection to them for even an
hour, so that the truth of the gospel would remain with you.&quot;  (Galatians
2:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;A woman must quietly receive instruction with entire
submissiveness.&quot;  (1 Timothy 2:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Timothy 3:5, “know” is <span lang=EL>οι</span>̓͂<span
lang=EL>δα</span> (oida) and is a perfect active indicative used as a present
tense. “To manage” is the aorist active infinitive of <span lang=EL>προι</span>̈́́<span
lang=EL>στημι</span> (proistēmi) and is an assumption. The assumption is that
if he cannot take care of his own home, he won’t be able to take care of the
church.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;(but if a man does not know how to manage his own
household, how will he take care of the church of God?),&quot;  (1 Timothy 3:5,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Timothy 3:5, “take care of” is the future active
indicative of <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>πιμελε</span>́<span lang=EL>ομαι</span>
(epimeleomai) and signifies to take care of, involving forethought, provision,
intense care, protection. It was used of the Good Samaritan’s care for the
wounded man as well in Luke 10:34-35.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and came to him and bandaged up his wounds, pouring oil
and wine on them; and he put him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn
and took care of him. &quot;On the next day he took out two denarii and gave
them to the innkeeper and said, 'Take care of him; and whatever more you spend,
when I return I will repay you.'&quot;  (Luke 10:34-35, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher’s need for spiritual maturity is found
in 1 Timothy 3:6. “Not a new convert” is <span lang=EL>νεο</span>́<span
lang=EL>φυτος</span> (neophutos) and means newly-planted, tender, immature,
incapable of production. Babes in the spiritual life are not to function as
pastor-teachers, even though they have the gift. A growing believer may have a
limited ministry. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Become conceited” is the aorist passive participle of <span
lang=EL>τυφο</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (tuphoō) and means to be puffed up,
to be conceited, to be proud. “To fall” is the aorist active subjunctive of <span
lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>μπι</span>́<span lang=EL>πτω</span> (empiptō). 
He gets out of fellowship, stays out of fellowship, builds up scar tissue in
his soul, stays in reversionism, continues to degenerate and finally checks out
under the sin unto death.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and not a new convert, so that he will not become
conceited and fall into the condemnation incurred by the devil.&quot;  (1
Timothy 3:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is a very important verse because it is for thorough
preparation on the part of the pastor-teacher. Terrible damage has been done in
Christian circles by half-cocked Christian leaders who jump into the ministry
unprepared because the Rapture was going to take place the next day. Probably
age 30 is an excellent age to get into the ministry. By that time, the one with
the gift of pastor-teacher will have had four years of college, four years of
the military, and a couple of years training in a local church learning the
Greek and Hebrew. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Growing believers in the ministry sublimate and
substitute gimmicks for the grace of God. They don’t understand what the
Christian way of life is, so they call it discipleship. They rehash the Gospel
1000 different ways. They use trite phrases like, “Christ is not Lord at all,
until He is Lord of all.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor’s relationship to unbelievers is found in 1
Timothy 3:7. “Reputation” is <span lang=EL>μαρτυρι</span>́<span lang=EL>α</span>
(marturia) and means a good testimony, a good witness to unbelievers.
“Reproach” is <span lang=EL>ο</span>̓<span lang=EL>νειδισμο</span>́<span
lang=EL>ς</span> (oneidismos) and is also used in Romans 15:3, Hebrews 10:33,
Hebrews 11:26, and Hebrews 13:13. “Snare” is <span lang=EL>παγι</span>́<span
lang=EL>ς</span> (pagis) and means a trap, the allurements to sin by which the
devil holds one bound, which can include anything from self-pity to bitterness.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And he must have a good reputation with those outside the
church, so that he will not fall into reproach and the snare of the
devil.&quot;  (1 Timothy 3:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For even Christ did not please Himself; but as it is
written, &quot;THE REPROACHES OF THOSE WHO REPROACHED YOU FELL ON
ME.&quot;&quot;  (Romans 15:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;partly by being made a public spectacle through
reproaches and tribulations, and partly by becoming sharers with those who were
so treated.&quot;  (Hebrews 10:33, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;considering the reproach of Christ greater riches than
the treasures of Egypt; for he was looking to the reward.&quot;  (Hebrews
11:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So, let us go out to Him outside the camp, bearing His
reproach.&quot;  (Hebrews 13:13, NASB)</p>
