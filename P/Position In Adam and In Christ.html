<h2><a name="_Performance"></a><a name="_Perspicacity_by_Grace"></a>Position In
Adam and In Christ</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Our Position in Adam</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When Adam sinned in the Garden, he became spiritually
dead (separated from God) and brought into existence the old sin nature. This
is inherent sin. Rom. 5:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world,
and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned—”
(Romans 5:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The entire human race was counted guilty when Adam sinned
because the human race was born of Adam’s seed. When Adam was condemned, Adam’s
progeny were also condemned. 1 Cor. 15:21-22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For since by a man came death, by a man also came the
resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be
made alive.” (1 Corinthians 15:21-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When we are physically born, we arrive with a
genetically-formed old sin nature. At birth, God the Father imputes Adam’s
Original Sin to that old sin nature. This is imputed sin. God the Father also
imputes soul life to the format soul causing our first breath. Thus, we are
born physically alive and spiritually dead. </p>

<p class=Verses>“even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive
together with Christ (by grace you have been saved), and raised us up with Him,
and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,” (Ephesians
2:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Our Position in Christ</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As an unbeliever, we had only a relationship in Adam. As
a Church Age believer, we now have a permanent relationship in Christ (Baptism
of the Spirit) and everything He is and has, we are and share positionally. This
is Positional Truth. In our permanent position in Christ, we share His eternal
life. 1 John 5:11-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the testimony is this, that God has given us eternal life,
and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has the life; he who does not
have the Son of God does not have the life.” (1 John 5:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>In our permanent position in
Christ, we share His perfect and absolute righteousness. The very righteousness
of God (+R). 2 Cor. 5:21. </p>

<p class=Verses>“He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that
we might become the righteousness of God in Him.” (2 Corinthians 5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In our permanent position in Christ, we share His sonship.
Gal. 3:26.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.”
(Galatians 3:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In our permanent position in Christ, we share His
election. We are elected with Him forever. Eph. 1:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world,
that we would be holy and blameless before Him. In love” (Ephesians 1:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In our permanent position in Christ, we share His eternal
destiny. Eph. 1:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to
Himself, according to the kind intention of His will,” (Ephesians 1:5, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In our permanent position in Christ, we share His
heirship. We are joint-heirs with Him. Rom. 8:16-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are
children of God, and if children, heirs also, heirs of God and fellow heirs
with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him so that we may also be glorified with
Him.” (Romans 8:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In our permanent position in Christ, we share His sanctification.
We are set apart unto God in Him, so we are sanctified. 1 Cor. 1:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“To the church of God which is at Corinth, to those who have
been sanctified in Christ Jesus, saints by calling, with all who in every place
call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours:” (1 Corinthians
1:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In our permanent
position in Christ, we share His priesthood. He is our high priest. Every Church
Age believer is a priest and, therefore, represents themselves directly before
God. 1 Peter 2:5-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“you also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual
house for a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
through Jesus Christ. For this is contained in Scripture: &quot;BEHOLD, I LAY
IN ZION A CHOICE STONE, A PRECIOUS CORNER stone, AND HE WHO BELIEVES IN HIM
WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.&quot; This precious value, then, is for you who
believe; but for those who disbelieve, &quot;THE STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS
REJECTED, THIS BECAME THE VERY CORNER stone,&quot; and, &quot;A STONE OF
STUMBLING AND A ROCK OF OFFENSE&quot;; for they stumble because they are
disobedient to the word, and to this doom they were also appointed. But you are
A CHOSEN RACE, A royal PRIESTHOOD, A HOLY NATION, A PEOPLE FOR God's OWN
POSSESSION, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you
out of darkness into His marvelous light;” (1 Peter 2:5-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In our permanent position in Christ, we share His kingship.
2 Peter 1:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“for in this way the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be abundantly supplied to you.” (2 Peter
1:11, NASB)</p>
