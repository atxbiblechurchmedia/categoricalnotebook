<h2>Pride</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Pride is an inordinate self-esteem or conceit. It is an
arrogance coming from the old sin nature. Pride is lofty self-respect, a
feeling of elation or exaltation because of what one is or what one has. Ego is
not pride. There is a difference between self-consciousness and pride. Pride
must not be confused with self-consciousness. Self-consciousness is simply
awareness of one’s existence, personality, or one’s being. Self-consciousness
is not a sin. Satan’s original sin was the mental attitude sin of pride. Isaiah
14:12-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;How you have fallen from heaven, O star of the
morning, son of the dawn! You have been cut down to the earth, You who have
weakened the nations! &quot;But you said in your heart, 'I will ascend to
heaven; I will raise my throne above the stars of God, And I will sit on the
mount of assembly In the recesses of the north. 'I will ascend above the
heights of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.'
&quot;Nevertheless you will be thrust down to Sheol, To the recesses of the
pit. &quot;Those who see you will gaze at you, They will ponder over you,
saying, 'Is this the man who made the earth tremble, Who shook kingdoms, Who
made the world like a wilderness And overthrew its cities, Who did not allow
his prisoners to go home?'&quot;  (Isaiah 14:12-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When self-consciousness is linked up with the lust
patterns of the old sin nature, then self-consciousness becomes a sin. Pride
equals self-consciousness plus one or more factors in the lust pattern. Pride
overtly expressed includes haughty and overbearing behavior which is always
disorientation to grace. Pride is in direct controversy and antithetical to the
concept of grace.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Pride is an undue sense of one’s own superiority and is always
a sin. Pride glorifies human good. However pride is not poise, or speaking with
authority, or standing erect. One who is properly self-conscious has a balanced
sense of personal existence, personal dignity, worth, and self-respect. Pride (haughty
eyes) is at the top of the list in Proverbs 6:16-19.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;There are six things which the LORD hates, Yes, seven
which are an abomination to Him: Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, And hands that
shed innocent blood, A heart that devises wicked plans, Feet that run rapidly
to evil, A false witness who utters lies, And one who spreads strife among
brothers.&quot;  (Proverbs 6:16-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer should learn to distinguish from boasting
which comes from the confidence generated from the daily function of the grace
apparatus for perception and the building of the edification complex in the
soul. In 2 Corinthians 12:1-10, this type of “boasting” is bona fide. In
contrast, there is a “boasting” which comes from the old sin nature. 2 Corinthians
12:5 has both types of boasting where Paul is saying I will boast from my
confidence in Bible doctrine and I will not boast from pride which is a mental
attitude sin.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;On behalf of such a man I will boast; but on my own
behalf I will not boast, except in regard to my weaknesses.&quot;  (2
Corinthians 12:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Pride as a Hindrance  </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When the right lobe of the soul is conquered by pride from
emotional revolt, it destroys the freedom of human volition. Pride becomes a
conqueror and causes soul slavery. That is why mental attitude sins are the
worst. Pride destroys objectivity and replaces it with subjectivity. When pride
gains complete control of the soul, free will does not operate on a bona fide
basis. Instead of making decisions based on facts, free will decisions are made
on the basis of who and what you are. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When pride gets into the soul, the believer no longer
asks “what are the facts?” or “what is the doctrine?” Instead, they ask “who
and what am I?” It is who God is that counts! When people are operating on ego
lust, then Bible doctrine does not stimulate their thinking. No one can
understand the issue of the Gospel or be interested in doctrine when they are
operating on ego lust. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Pride of Nebuchadnezzar </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Daniel 4, Nebuchadnezzar was not yet ready for Gospel
hearing. He had to go through seven years of living like an animal before he
considered the facts rather than himself. The principle of punishment for
Nebuchadnezzar is that because of his emotional revolt and mental illness, he tried
to exalt himself above man and became so mentally ill that he went below man to
live like an animal for seven years. The purpose of this illness was so that
God could keep His Word. God promises that when anyone reaches God-consciousness
and goes on positive signals, God will provide Gospel information whereby they
can be saved. John 7:17. </p>

<p class=Verses>““If anyone is willing to do His will, he will know of the
teaching, whether it is of God or whether I speak from Myself.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John
7:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God did “leave the stump” so that when Nebuchadnezzar’s
ego got out of the way, he could evaluate the facts and make a decision. Daniel
4:23-26.</p>

<p class=Verses>“‘In that the king saw an angelic watcher, a holy one,
descending from heaven and saying, “Chop down the tree and destroy it; yet
leave the stump with its roots in the ground, but with a band of iron and
bronze around it in the new grass of the field, and let him be drenched with
the dew of heaven, and let him share with the beasts of the field until seven
periods of time pass over him,” this is the interpretation, O king, and this is
the decree of the Most High, which has come upon my lord the king: that you be
driven away from mankind and your dwelling place be with the beasts of the
field, and you be given grass to eat like cattle and be drenched with the dew
of heaven; and seven periods of time will pass over you, until you recognize
that the Most High is ruler over the realm of mankind and bestows it on
whomever He wishes. ‘And in that it was commanded to leave the stump with the
roots of the tree, your kingdom will be assured to you after you recognize that
it is Heaven that rules.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Daniel 4:23-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This terrible illness had to take place in order for the
issue to be clear, in order for Nebuchadnezzar to be objective toward the Gospel.
Nebuchadnezzar could not make a decision until he could see the true issue.
Pride blinded him to the issue. Through this judgment, God removed the pride so
his volition could decide concerning the Gospel. God keeps His promises to show
the Gospel to anyone with positive volition at God-consciousness. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Pride Rejects Grace</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Pride in the carnal believer results in the rejection of
eternal security. They think their sins are greater than what the plan of God
can handle. Pride causes the believer to succumb or knuckle under to pressures
and adversity in life. The proud believer thinks their sufferings are greater
than God's grace provision can cover.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is the pride of the pseudo-spiritual believer. The
negative proud believer thinks their human system is greater than the power of
the Holy Spirit in him. The pride of the believer results when under emotional
revolt of the soul. The negative proud believer thinks their emotions, their
feelings, and their experiences are more important than Bible doctrine.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 8:9, “that though He was rich” is <span
lang=EL>πλου</span>́<span lang=EL>σιος</span><span lang=EL> </span><span
lang=EL>ω</span>̓́<span lang=EL>ν</span> (plousios ōn), the present active
participle of <i>eimi</i>, an absolute status quo verb. This was the status quo
of God in eternity past. This is the maximum concept of wealth. The phrase means
abounding in riches. “Yet for your sake” is <span lang=EL>διά</span> plus
accusative plural of <span lang=EL>συ</span> and means “because of you all” and
refers to the substitutionary plan of salvation on the Cross.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though
He was rich, yet for your sake He became poor, so that you through His poverty
might become rich.” (2 Corinthians 8:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“He became poor” is the aorist active indicative of <span
lang=EL>πτωχευ</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (ptōcheuō) and means abject
poverty. Jesus Christ had something to give, His humanity in sinless innocence.
This refers to the three hours on the Cross when He bore our sins. He did this
voluntarily resulting in the reality of Christ Himself being judged for our
sins.</p>
