<h2><a name="_Pastor-Teacher’s_Objective:_Daily"></a>Pastor-Teacher, Objectives</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Daily Study and Teaching</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A basic command for the pastor-teacher and all believers is
“daily shall you eat.” The believer’s drink of faith is the water of life - salvation.
The believer’s food of faith is the bread of life - spiritual growth. The Word
of God was in the beginning. The Word is Jesus Christ. The Word of God was
daily the delight of the Trinity. The Word of God was daily the delight of the
blessed man. John 4:14; John 6:31-32; John 1:1; Prov. 8:30; Prov. 8:34. </p>

<p class=Verses>“but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall
never thirst; but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of
water springing up to eternal life.&quot;” (John 4:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is
written, 'HE GAVE THEM BREAD OUT OF HEAVEN TO EAT.'&quot; Jesus then said to
them, &quot;Truly, truly, I say to you, it is not Moses who has given you the
bread out of heaven, but it is My Father who gives you the true bread out of
heaven.” (John 6:31-32, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,
and the Word was God.&quot;  (John 1:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then I was beside Him, as a master workman; And I was
daily His delight, Rejoicing always before Him,&quot;  (Proverbs 8:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Blessed is the man who listens to me, Watching
daily at my gates, Waiting at my doorposts.&quot;  (Proverbs 8:34, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Word of God was daily taught in the restoration of
the earth. Each day began with the words from God, “God said.” Day 1, Gen. 1:3.
Day 2, Gen. 1:6. Day 3, Gen. 1:9. Day 4, Gen. 1:14. Day 5, Gen 1:20. Day 6,
Gen.1:24, Gen 1:26, Gen.1:28, Gen.1:29. That is daily teaching of Bible
doctrine. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then God said, &quot;Let there be light&quot;; and there
was light.&quot;  (Genesis 1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then God said, &quot;Let there be an expanse in the midst
of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.&quot;&quot; 
(Genesis 1:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then God said, &quot;Let the waters below the heavens be
gathered into one place, and let the dry land appear&quot;; and it was
so.&quot;  (Genesis 1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then God said, &quot;Let there be lights in the expanse
of the heavens to separate the day from the night, and let them be for signs
and for seasons and for days and years;&quot;  (Genesis 1:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then God said, &quot;Let the earth bring forth living
creatures after their kind: cattle and creeping things and beasts of the earth
after their kind&quot;; and it was so.&quot;  (Genesis 1:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i><span style='color:blue'>&quot;Then God said,
&quot;Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them
rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle
and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.&quot;&quot; 
(Genesis 1:26, NASB)</span></i></p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;God blessed them; and God said to them, &quot;Be fruitful
and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and rule over the fish of the
sea and over the birds of the sky and over every living thing that moves on the
earth.&quot;&quot;  (Genesis 1:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then God said, &quot;Behold, I have given you every plant
yielding seed that is on the surface of all the earth, and every tree which has
fruit yielding seed; it shall be food for you;&quot;  (Genesis 1:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Word of God was daily taught in the daytime with
trees and animals and plants as scenery and illustration. It is not until the
woman was created that Adam “said” anything. Up to that time, Adam “called.” Gen.
2:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The LORD God commanded the man, saying, &quot;From any
tree of the garden you may eat freely;&quot;  (Genesis 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Word of God was daily taught in the garden of Eden.
Any thinking of Jesus Christ is Scripture. Any speaking of God is doctrine. The
Word of God was daily taught by Job to his family. Gen. 3:8; Job 1:4-5; Job
23:12. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;They heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the
garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the
presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden.&quot;  (Genesis 3:8,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;His sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each
one on his day, and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and
drink with them. When the days of feasting had completed their cycle, Job would
send and consecrate them, rising up early in the morning and offering burnt
offerings according to the number of them all; for Job said, &quot;Perhaps my
sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.&quot; Thus Job did
continually.&quot;  (Job 1:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;I have not departed from the command of His lips; I
have treasured the words of His mouth more than my necessary food.&quot;  (Job
23:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The daily intake of the Word of God is more important
than the daily intake of food. Matt. 4:4; John 6:31; Deut. 8:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But He answered and said, &quot;It is written, 'MAN SHALL
NOT LIVE ON BREAD ALONE, BUT ON EVERY WORD THAT PROCEEDS OUT OF THE MOUTH OF
GOD.'&quot;&quot;  (Matthew 4:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it
is written, 'HE GAVE THEM BREAD OUT OF HEAVEN TO EAT.'&quot;&quot;  (John 6:31,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;He humbled you and let you be hungry, and fed you
with manna which you did not know, nor did your fathers know, that He might
make you understand that man does not live by bread alone, but man lives by
everything that proceeds out of the mouth of the LORD.&quot;  (Deuteronomy 8:3,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The priests in the Old Testament ministered daily. Heb.
10:11. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Every priest stands daily ministering and offering time
after time the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins;&quot;  (Hebrews
10:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Lord Jesus Christ ministered daily while on earth. He
taught daily in the temple. Matt. 26:55; Luke 19:47-48.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;At that time Jesus said to the crowds, &quot;Have you
come out with swords and clubs to arrest Me as you would against a robber?
Every day I used to sit in the temple teaching and you did not seize Me.&quot; 
(Matthew 26:55, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He was teaching daily in the temple; but the chief
priests and the scribes and the leading men among the people were trying to
destroy Him, and they could not find anything that they might do, for all the
people were hanging on to every word He said.&quot;  (Luke 19:47-48, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the temple and from house to house there was daily
evangelism and teaching of Bible doctrine to build up believers in the faith.
Acts 2:46-47; Acts 5:42.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Day by day continuing with one mind in the temple, and
breaking bread from house to house, they were taking their meals together with
gladness and sincerity of heart, praising God and having favor with all the
people. And the Lord was adding to their number day by day those who were being
saved.&quot;  (Acts 2:46-47, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And every day, in the temple and from house to house,
they kept right on teaching and preaching Jesus as the Christ.&quot;  (Acts
5:42, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They had daily <i>diakonia</i> so they could give
themselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the Word. It was a good
move. Acts 6:2-3; Acts 6:7; Acts 16:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So the twelve summoned the congregation of the disciples
and said, &quot;It is not desirable for us to neglect the word of God in order
to serve tables. &quot;Therefore, brethren, select from among you seven men of
good reputation, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may put in charge of
this task.&quot;  (Acts 6:2-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The word of God kept on spreading; and the number of the
disciples continued to increase greatly in Jerusalem, and a great many of the
priests were becoming obedient to the faith.&quot;  (Acts 6:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So the churches were being strengthened in the faith, and
were increasing in number daily.&quot;  (Acts 16:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They had daily teaching, daily searching, and daily
believing in Christ. Acts 17:10-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The brethren immediately sent Paul and Silas away by
night to Berea, and when they arrived, they went into the synagogue of the
Jews. Now these were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica, for they
received the word with great eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see
whether these things were so. Therefore many of them believed, along with a
number of prominent Greek women and men.&quot;  (Acts 17:10-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul in Ephesus was very effective in his teaching of the
Word even in the face of opposition. Paul’s ministry was daily in regard with
the local church. Acts 19:8-9, 2 Cor. 11:28.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And he entered the synagogue and continued speaking out
boldly for three months, reasoning and persuading them about the kingdom of
God. But when some were becoming hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the
Way before the people, he withdrew from them and took away the disciples,
reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.&quot;  (Acts 19:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Apart from such external things, there is the daily
pressure on me of concern for all the churches.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 11:28,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They encouraged one another daily in public assembly. To
“encourage” is the present active imperative of <span lang=EL>παρακαλε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (parakaleō). Heb. 3:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But encourage one another day after day, as long as it is
still called &quot;Today,&quot; so that none of you will be hardened by the
deceitfulness of sin.&quot;  (Hebrews 3:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 10:25, “not forsaking our own assembling
together” refers to public assembly and is <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span
lang=EL>πισυναγωγη</span>́ (episunagōgē) in the Greek which means a gathering
together in one place. Public assembly is for the teaching of Bible doctrine
with the congregation filled with the Holy Spirit with the grace apparatus for
perception functioning. What is very often not accepted is the biblical precept
and command to assemble daily under a pastor-teacher. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the
habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more as you see the day
drawing near.&quot;  (Hebrews 10:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What is often accepted are things like reading the Bible
at the breakfast table along with Daily Bread. Having daily prayers or Streams
in the desert. Witnessing once or twice a month. Being in church at 11:00 AM
once a week and at the most, morning, evening and midweek. Is the issue of
daily assembly from the Bible or is it some idea of my pastor-teacher? Does the
Word of God actually teach daily assembly under a pastor-teacher to fulfill the
plan of God during the Church Age? Idioms for daily teaching can be found in 2
Timothy 4:2 and 1 Timothy 5:17-18. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;preach the word; be ready in season and out of season;
reprove, rebuke, exhort, with great patience and instruction.&quot;  (2 Timothy
4:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The elders who rule well are to be considered worthy of
double honor, especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching. For the
Scripture says, &quot;YOU SHALL NOT MUZZLE THE OX WHILE HE IS THRESHING,&quot;
and &quot;The laborer is worthy of his wages.&quot;&quot;  (1 Timothy 5:17-18,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Prophets were daily ministers of the Word of God.
Jeremiah spoke daily. When he decided to not speak daily, it really caused
internal problems. Jer. 7:25-34; Jer. 7:29; Jer. 20:7-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Since the day that your fathers came out of the
land of Egypt until this day, I have sent you all My servants the prophets,
daily rising early and sending them.&quot;  (Jeremiah 7:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;You shall say to them, 'This is the nation that did
not obey the voice of the LORD their God or accept correction; truth has
perished and has been cut off from their mouth.&quot;  (Jeremiah 7:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;O LORD, You have deceived me and I was deceived; You have
overcome me and prevailed. I have become a laughingstock all day long; Everyone
mocks me. For each time I speak, I cry aloud; I proclaim violence and
destruction, Because for me the word of the LORD has resulted In reproach and
derision all day long. But if I say, &quot;I will not remember Him Or speak
anymore in His name,&quot; Then in my heart it becomes like a burning fire Shut
up in my bones; And I am weary of holding it in, And I cannot endure it.&quot; 
(Jeremiah 20:7-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The daily sacrifice in Daniel spoke of the daily
dissemination of Bible doctrine. Dan. 8:11-13; Dan. 11:31; Dan. 12:11. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;It even magnified itself to be equal with the Commander
of the host; and it removed the regular sacrifice from Him, and the place of
His sanctuary was thrown down. And on account of transgression the host will be
given over to the horn along with the regular sacrifice; and it will fling
truth to the ground and perform its will and prosper. Then I heard a holy one
speaking, and another holy one said to that particular one who was speaking,
&quot;How long will the vision about the regular sacrifice apply, while the
transgression causes horror, so as to allow both the holy place and the host to
be trampled?&quot;&quot;  (Daniel 8:11-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Forces from him will arise, desecrate the sanctuary
fortress, and do away with the regular sacrifice. And they will set up the
abomination of desolation.&quot;  (Daniel 11:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;From the time that the regular sacrifice is
abolished and the abomination of desolation is set up, there will be 1,290
days.&quot;  (Daniel 12:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The phrase our Lord spoke “take up his cross daily and
follow Me” refers to daily intake of Bible doctrine under duly constituted
authority. The inward man must be renewed daily by teaching of Bible doctrine. Luke
9:23-26; 2 Cor. 4:16-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He was saying to them all, &quot;If anyone wishes to
come after Me, he must deny himself, and take up his cross daily and follow Me.
&quot;For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his
life for My sake, he is the one who will save it. &quot;For what is a man
profited if he gains the whole world, and loses or forfeits himself? &quot;For
whoever is ashamed of Me and My words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him
when He comes in His glory, and the glory of the Father and of the holy
angels.&quot;  (Luke 9:23-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words, the Son
of Man will be ashamed of him when He comes in His glory, and the glory of the
Father and of the holy angels.&quot;  (Luke 9:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore we do not lose heart, but though our outer man
is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day. For momentary,
light affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all
comparison, while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things
which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things
which are not seen are eternal.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 4:16-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Our Lord’s Three Mandates</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 21:15, “when they had finished breakfast” refers
to, by analogy, the most important thing to get on a daily basis is the intake
and application of Bible doctrine. “Do you love Me more than these?” is the present
active indicative of <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>γαπα</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (agapaō) and means “Have you got the mental attitude sin
problem solved?” Matt. 4:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So when they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon
Peter, &quot;Simon, son of John, do you love Me more than these?&quot; He said
to Him, &quot;Yes, Lord; You know that I love You.&quot; He said to him,
&quot;Tend My lambs.&quot;” (John 21:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But He answered and said, &quot;It is written, 'MAN SHALL NOT
LIVE ON BREAD ALONE, BUT ON EVERY WORD THAT PROCEEDS OUT OF THE MOUTH OF
GOD.'&quot;” (Matthew 4:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Peter had not advanced in his <i>agapao</i> love
relationship with the Lord, or had he? Peter saw the issue, but had Peter’s
love advanced? Yes, it had. His edification complex of the soul had been
partially erected, but he was still not at spiritual maturity. The adolescent
disciples scattered at the crucifixion, but they were regrouping then. Peter made
it clear that he had a maximum or total love <span lang=EL>φιλε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (phileō) for the Lord. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In <i>agapao</i> love you first have a relaxed mental
attitude toward God. You relax around Him. The essence of God is understood,
the Trinity is understood, and the Barrier is understood. You have grace
orientation toward Him. You understand who and what God is. You go after Bible
doctrine on a daily basis. You must have mastery of your life’s details to do
this.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In <i>phileo</i> love, you graduate to rapport love for
the Lord with more of the edification complex of the soul erected. Passing the <i>phileo</i>
love test means have you made the Word of God your highest priority on a daily
basis when compared to your other priorities. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 21:15, our Lord asked Peter, “do you love Me more
than these?” What do you have rapport with? What do you like to do? What makes
the hours pass swiftly for you? Cleaning house, reading books, travelling,
sewing, community service organizations, politics? Jesus Christ gives Peter His
first of three commands. “Tend My lambs” referring to new believers. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 21:16, our Lord said a second time, “do you love
Me?” meaning do you keep on loving Me with <i>agapao</i> love. Peter’s three
denials of Christ indicated a weak type of mental attitude love and no rapport
love. By repeating this, the Lord was indicating that just a relaxed mental
attitude toward Christ is not sufficient. The love must be advanced to <i>phileo</i>
love, a total soul love which accompanies the erection of the edification
complex of the soul. Peter replied with some exasperation, “Yes, Lord; You know
that I love You” where Peter wanted to convey that he did have a <i>phileo</i>
rapport love for our Lord. Peter felt that he had advanced spiritually from the

<p class=Verses>“He said to him again a second time, &quot;Simon, son of John,
do you love Me?&quot; He said to Him, &quot;Yes, Lord; You know that I love
You.&quot; He said to him, &quot;Shepherd My sheep.&quot;” (John 21:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Peter is given the second of three commands, which are the
same as used in 1 Peter 5:2. This is “Shepherd My sheep.” This second command
refers to the adolescent sheep who can be hard headed. They need a tougher
approach and sometimes need to be clobbered with Bible doctrine. These are
believers who have learned just enough doctrine to think themselves spiritually
self-sufficient, and can be independent of any pastor, any shepherd.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 21:17, our Lord asked Peter a third time, “do you
love Me?” but changed the type of love to <i>phileo</i> love. Our Lord realized
the true spiritual status of Peter so He changed to <i>phileo</i>. The spiritual
advance of Peter was realized. “Peter was grieved” is the aorist active
indicative of <span lang=EL>λυπε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (lupeō) and means
to be mentally reactive, mental pain, to be on the verge of antagonism.  Peter was
about to blow it all right here. “You know” is <span lang=EL>οι</span>̓͂<span
lang=EL>δα</span> (oida) in the perfect used as a present and means “from Your
omniscience, You know all things.” “Know” is <span lang=EL>γινω</span>́<span
lang=EL>σκω</span> (ginōskō) and means that Peter was saying that Our Lord
knew from experience that Peter had a <i>phileo</i> or rapport love for Him.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He said to him the third time, &quot;Simon, son of John, do
you love Me?&quot; Peter was grieved because He said to him the third time,
&quot;Do you love Me?&quot; And he said to Him, &quot;Lord, You know all
things; You know that I love You.&quot; Jesus said to him, &quot;Tend My
sheep.” (John 21:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Peter was given the third of three commands, “Tend My
sheep.” “Tend” is <span lang=EL>βο</span>́<span lang=EL>σκω</span> (boskō) and
means to nourish, to feed. <i>Boskō</i> means you can feed your mature
believers (at least some mature believers) without ever having to get rough
with them.  Some sheep learn easily.</p>
