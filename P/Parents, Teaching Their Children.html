<h2>Parents, Teaching Their Children</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Teach your own children, when you travel, before going to
bed at night, and the first thing when they get up. Start with God’s essence.
Show them how to walk in fellowship and to love the Lord. Have them memorize
the Word. Divine viewpoint should always to be the topic of conversation around
the home. Prov. 22:6; Deut. 6:4-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Train up a child in the way he should go, Even when he is old
he will not depart from it.”  (Proverbs 22:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““Hear, O Israel! The LORD is our God, the LORD is one! “You
shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and
with all your might. “These words, which I am commanding you today, shall be on
your heart. “You shall teach them diligently to your sons and shall talk of
them when you sit in your house and when you walk by the way and when you lie
down and when you rise up. “You shall bind them as a sign on your hand and they
shall be as frontals on your forehead. “You shall write them on the doorposts
of your house and on your gates.”  (Deuteronomy 6:4-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Principles of Teaching</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In teaching Bible doctrine to children, it should not
only be learned so well that they know it, but so well that they can never
forget it. When you can teach doctrine to others you are well on your way to
understanding it. Teaching doctrine helps you function under the grace
apparatus for perception.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Parents are responsible unto the Lord for every decision
that their children make. Therefore, until they can make their own decisions,
parents are to make all of them for the children. They must, through studying
the Word, teach their children to make divine viewpoint decisions.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Parents stand in the place of God to their children,
therefore God has given them the responsibility and privilege of being
objective in the disciplining and rewarding of their children according to
Bible doctrine. Motivation for parents in dealing with their children is best
illustrated in the way that God deals with us, His children.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If children are not taught Bible doctrine in the home
when they are young, then they will have to learn it the hard way, through
divine discipline. Therefore, a parent expresses true love to their children by
teaching them Bible doctrine. The definition of love is that it always does
what is best for the other person.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Children are the overt expression of their parents, a
result of teaching or a lack of it, whichever the case may be. Teaching of
their children is the responsibility of the parents, not that of the local
church or the pastor-teacher. It is important that every member of the family
participate, including the mother.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A true test of your teaching ability is to let the
children teach the class ever so often to see what they have learned. Because
of his role as initiator, the father will promote maximum blessing for his
family if he does the teaching.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Mechanics of Teaching</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Talk about the teaching to come among the family members
prior to the teaching time to create interest and anticipation. Have a relaxed
mental attitude. The father’s personal life and study time should be considered
foremost. 1 Tim. 4:15-16; 2 Tim. 2:15; 2 Tim. 3:16-17. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Take pains with these things; be absorbed in them, so that
your progress will be evident to all. Pay close attention to yourself and to
your teaching; persevere in these things, for as you do this you will ensure
salvation both for yourself and for those who hear you.”  (1 Timothy 4:15-16,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman
who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth.”  (2
Timothy 2:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching,
for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; so that the man of
God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.”  (2 Timothy 3:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Remember that the Holy Spirit is your teacher and the
necessity of being Spirit-filled through the provision of 1 John 1:9. Eph.
5:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”  (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but
be filled with the Spirit,”  (Ephesians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>First things first. To start off the family study time,
be sure to set aside a few minutes for silent self-examination and confession
before getting started. After this is done, the father closes in prayer. Have
Bibles and notebooks for every member of the family. Have available pens and
pencils, whiteboard or chalkboard to write on. Consider a bulletin board with
various type of visual aids.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Review the subjects to be taught based on the lessons and
doctrines communicated by the pastor-teacher. Dealing with the personal needs
of the family are of primary importance. For example, if a child is having a
problem because he is habitually out of fellowship, the teaching of confession
of sin biblically would be in order. Be practical. This categorical notebook is
a good frame of reference.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For more advanced teaching methods, utilize a series
dealing with Bible characters, books of the Bible, printed books, eBooks,
podcasts, and audio and video recordings of Bible doctrine lessons available on
the internet from known doctrinal sources.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To best communicate with your children, this teaching
time must be informative, fun and exciting depending on the various age levels
involved. Remember advanced preparation is the key to good organization so make
sure all materials related to the subject being taught are available before the
class begins. Wives can be a real asset to the husband in handling these
details for him.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Because the primary objective of the parents is to have
the children understand and learn, Bible doctrine it is therefore necessary for
you to have assignments given out at the end of each class. An occasional test
or quiz helps you to keep tabs on their progress. Learn Bible promises and
principles. Learn how to apply these promises and principles. Learn points of
doctrine. Learn the books of the Bible. Learn Greek. Learn basic and advanced
doctrines.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Time and length of the class. This is up to the
individual family depending upon the attention span of the children involved. A
side benefit of teaching is that you will find that the attention span and
concentration of children will increase with the increased teaching of Bible
doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The father should teach at least once a week with the
mother reviewing and following up on a daily basis. Conclusion. Develop the
lesson to its climax unhurriedly. Never break it off abruptly.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In summary, leave them something to think about.
Challenge your family. Anticipate the next lesson. Show in your own life the
application of the doctrine you have taught. Know that your efforts are not in
vain. 1 Cor. 15:58.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable,
always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your toil is not in vain
in the Lord.”  (1 Corinthians 15:58, NASB)</p>
