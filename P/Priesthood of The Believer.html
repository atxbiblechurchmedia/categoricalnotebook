<h2><a name="_Priesthood_of_The"></a>Priesthood of The Believer</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A priest is a member of the human race who represents
human beings before God, male or female. A priest must have the same nature as
those they represent or act on behalf of. Heb. 5:1-3; Heb. 5:4-6; Heb. 10:5; Heb.
7:28.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For every high priest taken from among men is appointed on
behalf of men in things pertaining to God, in order to offer both gifts and
sacrifices for sins; he can deal gently with the ignorant and misguided, since
he himself also is beset with weakness; and because of it he is obligated to
offer sacrifices for sins, as for the people, so also for himself.” (Hebrews
5:1-3, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“And no one takes the honor to himself, but receives it when he
is called by God, even as Aaron was. So also Christ did not glorify Himself so
as to become a high priest, but He who said to Him, &quot;YOU ARE MY SON, TODAY
I HAVE BEGOTTEN YOU&quot;; just as He says also in another passage, &quot;YOU
ARE A PRIEST FOREVER ACCORDING TO THE ORDER OF MELCHIZEDEK.&quot;” (Hebrews
5:4-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, when He comes into the world, He says,
&quot;SACRIFICE AND OFFERING YOU HAVE NOT DESIRED, BUT A BODY YOU HAVE PREPARED
FOR ME;” (Hebrews 10:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the Law appoints men as high priests who are weak, but the
word of the oath, which came after the Law, appoints a Son, made perfect
forever.” (Hebrews 7:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Old Testament, the priest represented people before
God in more of a legal function. In the Church Age, every believer is a royal priest
and therefore each has the right to represent themselves before God. 1 Peter
2:9. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But you are A CHOSEN RACE, A royal PRIESTHOOD, A HOLY NATION,
A PEOPLE FOR God's OWN POSSESSION, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of
Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;” (1 Peter 2:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Categories of Priesthood      </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Old Testament there were three categories of
priesthood - the Patriarchal or Family priesthood, the King-Priest, and the
Levitical priesthood of Israel. In the Church Age, there is only one priesthood
- the universal priesthood of all believers.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Old Testament Patriarchal or Family Priesthood</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the patriarchal or family priesthood, the patriarch of
the family functioned as the priest for the family. This priesthood functioned from
the time of Adam to the time of Moses. Examples of this priesthood are Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob. The patriarch of each family built altars and offered
sacrifices, and in so doing purified and consecrated themselves and their
households before God. Gen. 12:7; Gen. 13:18; Gen. 22:9; Gen. 26:25; Gen. 33:20;
Gen. 35:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD appeared to Abram and said, &quot;To your descendants
I will give this land.&quot; So he built an altar there to the LORD who had
appeared to him.” (Genesis 12:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Abram moved his tent and came and dwelt by the oaks of
Mamre, which are in Hebron, and there he built an altar to the LORD.” (Genesis
13:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So he built an altar there and called upon the name of the
LORD, and pitched his tent there; and there Isaac's servants dug a well.”
(Genesis 26:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then God said to Jacob, &quot;Arise, go up to Bethel and live
there, and make an altar there to God, who appeared to you when you fled from
your brother Esau.&quot; So Jacob said to his household and to all who were
with him, &quot;Put away the foreign gods which are among you, and purify
yourselves and change your garments;” (Genesis 35:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Old Testament King-Priest</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Old Testament king-priest is represented by
Melchizedek who was a king, the head of his family, and a priest. He was a
Gentile believer-priest living in the time of Abraham. He was the king of
Salem, which later became the city of Jerusalem. He was both a king and a
priest. His genealogy was not relevant to his priesthood. Heb. 7:1-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High
God, who met Abraham as he was returning from the slaughter of the kings and
blessed him, to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth part of all the spoils,
was first of all, by the translation of his name, king of righteousness, and
then also king of Salem, which is king of peace. Without father, without
mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life,
but made like the Son of God, he remains a priest perpetually.” (Hebrews 7:1-3,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Melchizedek was a “type” or “shadow” in the Old Testament
of Jesus Christ who would become the reality as the Messiah, our Savior. Each
was a human being, a king, and a priest. The humanity of each were superior to
Abraham as the father of the Jewish race and both Jesus Christ and Melchizedek
had no priestly genealogies related to Israel. Their priesthood was not based
on their physical birth. Melchizedek was a priest perpetually because he was a
believer with eternal life. Heb. 7:3; Heb. 7:12-16; Heb. 7:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having
neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, he
remains a priest perpetually.” (Hebrews 7:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For when the priesthood is changed, of necessity there takes
place a change of law also. For the one concerning whom these things are spoken
belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar. For it
is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, a tribe with reference to
which Moses spoke nothing concerning priests. And this is clearer still, if
another priest arises according to the likeness of Melchizedek, who has become
such not on the basis of a law of physical requirement, but according to the
power of an indestructible life.” (Hebrews 7:12-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For it is attested of Him, &quot;YOU ARE A PRIEST FOREVER
ACCORDING TO THE ORDER OF MELCHIZEDEK.&quot;” (Hebrews 7:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Melchizedek’s priesthood was superior to Abraham because
Melchizedek ministered to him and blessed him because he was a king-priest. Abraham
also gave tithes to Melchizedek. Abraham was only a priest, but not a king. Heb.
7:9-11.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“And, so to speak, through Abraham even Levi, who received
tithes, paid tithes, for he was still in the loins of his father when
Melchizedek met him. Now if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood
(for on the basis of it the people received the Law), what further need was
there for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek, and
not be designated according to the order of Aaron?” (Hebrews 7:9-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This means that the universal priesthood of the Church
Age believer is far greater than the Levitical priesthood. The Levitical
priesthood of the Old Testament was based on genealogy while the royal
priesthood of the Church Age is based solely on faith belief in the work of
Jesus Christ. Rev. 1:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and He has made us to be a kingdom, priests to His God and
Father—to Him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen.”
(Revelation 1:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Old Testament Levitical Priesthood of Israel </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Old Testament Levitical priesthood of Israel is limited
to the Jewish Age and will be functional again in the Millennium. The Levitical
priesthood was based their genealogy. In Numbers 16:5, Aaron was chosen by God
along with the tribe of Levi. </p>

<p class=Verses>“and he spoke to Korah and all his company, saying,
&quot;Tomorrow morning the LORD will show who is His, and who is holy, and will
bring him near to Himself; even the one whom He will choose, He will bring near
to Himself.” (Numbers 16:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The spiritual function of this priesthood was related to
ritual and to the teaching the Word of God. Heb. 10:1-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the Law, since it has only a shadow of the good things to
come and not the very form of things, can never, by the same sacrifices which
they offer continually year by year, make perfect those who draw near.
Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, because the worshipers,
having once been cleansed, would no longer have had consciousness of sins? But
in those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year by year. For it is
impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.” (Hebrews
10:1-4, NASB)                       </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Church Age Universal Priesthood of All Believers</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the dispensation of the Church Age, there is only one
priesthood, which is the universal royal priesthood of all believers. Our
priesthood is patterned after Melchizedek. Jesus Christ is our high priest. Old
Testament priesthoods were specialized priesthoods. In the Church Age, all
believers in Jesus Christ are priests and represent themselves directly to God
without any intermediary. Heb. 5:9-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And having been made perfect, He became to all those who obey
Him the source of eternal salvation, being designated by God as a high priest
according to the order of Melchizedek.” (Hebrews 5:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord was appointed a royal high priest by divine
decree in eternity past and at His resurrection, ascension, and session.
Therefore, Jesus Christ is a king-priest after the order of Melchizedek. All
believers are in eternal union with Him and therefore share His kingship and
His priesthood forever.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Functions of the Priesthood </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Confession of Sin</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first function of the Church Age believer’s
priesthood is confession of sin directly to God the Father. Confession of sin
is not part of the spiritual life, but is required to enter your spiritual life
and engage the enabling power of the Holy Spirit. Church Age believers
represent themselves before God the Father while living on earth. As
believer-priests, they are responsible for initiating confession of sin. They
represents themselves in carnality and are responsible for their own actions in
life. They are to name or cite their known sins directly to God the Father in
prayer to recover fellowship with God and to be filled with the Holy Spirit. 1
John 1:9; 1 Cor. 11:31; Rom. 14:4; Rom. 14:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But if we judged ourselves rightly, we would not be judged.”
(1 Corinthians 11:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Who are you to judge the servant of another? To his own master
he stands or falls; and he will stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand.”
(Romans 14:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But you, why do you judge your brother? Or you again, why do
you regard your brother with contempt? For we will all stand before the
judgment seat of God.” (Romans 14:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Old Testament, the confession of sin offerings
were public and everything was public knowledge. They went to the priest and he
represented them. In the Church Age, every believer is a priest and represent
themselves directly to God the Father without an intermediary like the
Levitical priesthood of the Old Testament. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>On earth, each believer must represent themselves. In
heaven, we are represented by our high priest, the Lord Jesus Christ, He is our
defense attorney. This is part of your privacy of your priesthood. 1 John
2:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“My little children, I am writing these things to you so that
you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus
Christ the righteous; and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins; and not
for ours only, but also for those of the whole world.” (1 John 2:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Spiritual Growth</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A second major function as a believer-priest is to learn
Bible doctrine on a daily basis. Making the daily intake and application of
Bible doctrine your number one priority in life is critical to spiritual
growth. God the Holy Spirit empowers your spiritual life and allows you to
understand and then believe the Bible doctrine taught by your pastor-teacher.
Only through spiritual growth and the enabling power of the Holy Spirit can
your royal priesthood function as God intended and therefore glorify Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Emotion and enthusiasm just won’t carry you in the
spiritual life. It is temporary and does not cause spiritual growth.
Emotionalism short-circuits objective thinking which is required to function
and grow in the spiritual life. Emotions are to be the appreciators of the
grace blessings bestowed on us by God. Luke 8:13-14. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Those on the rocky soil are those who, when they hear,
receive the word with joy; and these have no firm root; they believe for a
while, and in time of temptation fall away. &quot;The seed which fell among the
thorns, these are the ones who have heard, and as they go on their way they are
choked with worries and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit
to maturity.” (Luke 8:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The most consistent believers in the world are those who
attend Bible class regardless of what else is going on in their lives. Like
everybody else, they have problems. But unlike everybody else, they work out
their problems using God's divine solutions. Without consistent Bible doctrine
intake, you will try your human solutions and end up back in your old problems.
People can be consistent even though they have pressures.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The priesthood is tailor-made to handle trouble that
comes your way. All believers have problems, but using your priesthood takes
care of the old problems and anticipates that new problems will be solved.
Believers not functioning under Bible doctrine keep revisiting their old
problems.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every believer has a responsibility to test themselves to
see if they understand Bible doctrine and to evaluate whether they are in a
state of sin or not. Every believer determines their own status spiritually.
The spiritual life is a private matter between the believer and God. Each of us
must take the responsibility to evaluate and correct ourselves when found to be
wrong. 2 Cor. 13:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Test yourselves to see if you are in the faith; examine
yourselves! Or do you not recognize this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is
in you—unless indeed you fail the test?” (2 Corinthians 13:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Prayer and Intercession</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The third major function of the priesthood is prayer and
intercession. Being a priest, however, does not make you a good prayer warrior.
Who has the right to pray and go directly to the throne of grace? Any believer
because every Church Age believer is a priest. Don’t read a prayer unless you
wrote it yourself and are in fellowship. We are to pray with a consistent
frequency following confession of sin to ensure your prayers are heard by God
the Father. Heb. 4:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore let us draw near with confidence to the throne of
grace, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.”
(Hebrews 4:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every believer-priest is to perform certain spiritual
functions. This is taken from the functions of the Levitical priesthood, but
very different for the Church Age believer. Heb. 13:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Pray for us, for we are sure that we have a good conscience,
desiring to conduct ourselves honorably in all things.” (Hebrews 13:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Spiritual Sacrifices</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The priesthood is universal to all Church Age believers
and is localized. In 1 Peter 2:5, “to offer up spiritual sacrifices” is the
aorist active infinitive of <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>ναφε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ρω</span><span lang=EL> </span>(anapherō) and means to offer again and
again. It is the purpose of the believer-priest to offer up sacrifices again
and again. “Spiritual” is <span lang=EL>πνευματικο</span>́<span lang=EL>ς</span>
(pneumatikos) and stresses that these are spiritual sacrifices, not animal
sacrifices for the dispensation of the Church Age. Spiritual sacrifices can
only be accomplished through the filling of the Holy Spirit. “Acceptable to God”
is <span lang=EL>ευ</span>̓<span lang=EL>προ</span>́<span lang=EL>σδεκτος</span>
(euprosdektos) and is a compound triple adjective and means acceptable, well
pleasing, to be well pleased, receiving face to face gladly. Spiritual
sacrifices are well pleasing to God the Father. This is the spiritual service which
is the living and holy sacrifice of the believer-priest of Romans 12:1. Guilt
complex, breast beating and emotional revolt of the soul cause a false
priesthood to function in the carnal believer.</p>

<p class=Verses>“you also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual
house for a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
through Jesus Christ.” (1 Peter 2:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to
present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is
your spiritual service of worship.” (Romans 12:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>These spiritual sacrifices involve the believer-priest listening
to that which praises God, which is the Word. The Word is designed to honor
God. This results in the production of divine good and function of your
spiritual gifts. All spiritual sacrifices require the filling of the Holy
Spirit. In Hebrews 13:15, “sacrifice of praise” refers to the believer’s
identification with Jesus Christ in His person.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Through Him then, let us continually offer up a sacrifice of
praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips that give thanks to His name.”
(Hebrews 13:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers should have a giving mental attitude with overt
giving resulting from that grace mental attitude. In Hebrews 13:16, “doing
good” refers to the activity of the spiritual life where the believer
identifies with Jesus Christ in His walk. This is wise speech and wise activity
that produces divine good through the filling of the Spirit. “Doing good and
sharing” is the believer’s identification with Jesus Christ in His giving.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not neglect doing good and sharing, for with such
sacrifices God is pleased.” (Hebrews 13:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual sacrifices also involve authority orientation
to those placed in authority over you and prayer. This is the greatest function
of the priesthood. The believer priest is to be in obedience to the teaching of
the pastor-teacher in the local church. This is authority orientation to
divinely-delegated authority. The pastor-teacher carries authority. This
authority orientation extends to all divinely delegated authority within the
society you live in based on  the written laws of that society and nation.
Authority orientation is not designed to shame you or exploit you, but for your
protection. Heb. 13:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch over
your souls as those who will give an account. Let them do this with joy and not
with grief, for this would be unprofitable for you.” (Hebrews 13:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The priesthood on earth is organized on the basis of
spiritual gifts. Spiritual gifts are supernatural enablement given to believers
in Jesus Christ to grow and equip the Body of Christ “for the work of service”
in the Church Age. Spiritual gifts are grace gifts from God and are part of
God’s grace resources provided to enable the believer grow spiritually. In
growing spiritually, the unbelieving world is evangelized resulting in the
expansion of the Body of Christ. Believers are to function as members the Body
of Christ and to produce divine good thus glorifying God and fulfilling the
plan of God for their lives. Eph. 4:12-13; Eph. 4:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;for the equipping of the saints for the work of service,
to the building up of the body of Christ; until we all attain to the unity of
the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the
measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ.&quot; 
(Ephesians 4:12-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together
by what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each
individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in
love.&quot;  (Ephesians 4:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual sacrifices also involve witnessing to the
unbeliever. Church Age believers are ambassadors for Jesus Christ on earth and
we are to represent and reflect the very thinking of Jesus Christ in our
spiritual life on earth. 1 Cor. 2:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT
HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.” (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The objective is not to lead the unbeliever to Christ,
but to accurately give them the Gospel information so they can make a decision.
You should understand the doctrines of reconciliation, propitiation,
redemption, imputation, justification, regeneration, and expiation. You must
have this <i>epignosis</i> doctrine information in your soul. Witnessing for
Jesus Christ is the responsibility of every believer. Acts 1:8; 2 Tim. 4:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon
you; and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and
Samaria, and even to the remotest part of the earth.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 1:8,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But you, be sober in all things, endure hardship, do the work
of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Timothy 4:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Ministry of the Believer-Priest</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Angelic Conflict must be understood from the
standpoint of ascension. Hebrews 1-2. The humanity of Jesus Christ in
resurrection body was qualified to be seated in heaven. Jesus Christ was the
only one qualified to be seated. The Angelic Conflict tries to keep unbelievers
unsaved and to keep believers from maturing spiritually.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The priesthood of Jesus Christ is the most stabilizing
fellowship doctrine in all of Scripture. In Hebrews 3:1-2, “holy brethren”
means set apart. “A heavenly calling” means objective righteousness and doing
what is right in God’s eyes. “Consider” means to reflect, analyze, meditate,
getting rank in hand, to recognize authority. “He was faithful” refers to Jesus
Christ who is greater than Moses. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling,
consider Jesus, the Apostle and High Priest of our confession; He was faithful
to Him who appointed Him, as Moses also was in all His house.” (Hebrews 3:1-2,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 3:3-4, “the builder of the house” refers to
the believer who builds according to the Word of God.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For He has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by
just so much as the builder of the house has more honor than the house. For
every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.”
(Hebrews 3:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 3:5, “servant” is <span lang=EL>θερα</span>́<span
lang=EL>πων</span> (therapōn) and means an attendant, a servant of God, spoken
of Moses discharging the duties committed to him by God.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now Moses was faithful in all His house as a servant, for a
testimony of those things which were to be spoken later;” (Hebrews 3:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One of the greatest hazards of becoming an active,
mature, believer-priest is listening to Bible doctrine but not concentrating on
what you are hearing. In Hebrews 3:7-8, “do not harden your hearts” refers to
the buildup of soul scar tissue. “When they provoked Me” means they were griping,
murmuring, and complaining. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, just as the Holy Spirit says, &quot;TODAY IF YOU
HEAR HIS VOICE, DO NOT HARDEN YOUR HEARTS AS WHEN THEY PROVOKED ME, AS IN THE
DAY OF TRIAL IN THE WILDERNESS,” (Hebrews 3:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Another hazard in the spiritual life is rejection of
daily intake and application of Bible doctrine. This is making something else a
higher priority in your life. In doing so, you take that something more
seriously than the Word of God. This will cause the believer to fall short of spiritual
maturity and consistent divine good production. Faith is simply believing God’s
Word which is more real to you than the world in which you live. Heb. 3:12-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Take care, brethren, that there not be in any one of you an
evil, unbelieving heart that falls away from the living God. But encourage one
another day after day, as long as it is still called &quot;Today,&quot; so that
none of you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.” (Hebrews 3:12-13,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Believer’s Sacrifices</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A sacrifice is defined as an offering made to God to
procure favor, show dependence upon, to express thanks, or to avoid disaster. The
dearest thing to any human being is their own personal viewpoint. The greatest
sacrifice a believer can make is that of their own personal viewpoint in order
to agree with God’s divine viewpoint. The priesthood of the believer functions
volitionally within the Divine Institutions - Volition, Marriage, Family, and
Nationalism.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is much better to obey God's mandates immediately
(prevention) and apply <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine to life’s situations than
to sacrifice that will require confession of sin later. Examples are Samuel and
Saul in 1 Samuel 15:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Samuel said, &quot;Has the LORD as much delight in burnt
offerings and sacrifices As in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey
is better than sacrifice, And to heed than the fat of rams.” (1 Samuel 15:22,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are sacrifices of righteousness. Psalms 51:19; Psalms
4:5; Deut. 33:19; Mal. 3:3; Heb. 11:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then You will delight in righteous sacrifices, In burnt
offering and whole burnt offering; Then young bulls will be offered on Your
altar.” (Psalms 51:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;They will call peoples to the mountain; There they will
offer righteous sacrifices; For they will draw out the abundance of the seas,
And the hidden treasures of the sand.&quot;” (Deuteronomy 33:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, And trust in the LORD.”
(Psalms 4:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain,
through which he obtained the testimony that he was righteous, God testifying
about his gifts, and through faith, though he is dead, he still speaks.”
(Hebrews 11:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are sacrifices of thanksgiving. Psalms 116:17; Amos
4:5; Psalms 50:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“To You I shall offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving, And call
upon the name of the LORD.” (Psalms 116:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Offer a thank offering also from that which is leavened,
And proclaim freewill offerings, make them known. For so you love to do, you
sons of Israel,&quot; Declares the Lord GOD.” (Amos 4:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving And pay your
vows to the Most High;” (Psalms 50:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are sacrifices of prayer. Rev. 8:3; Heb. 5:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Another angel came and stood at the altar, holding a golden
censer; and much incense was given to him, so that he might add it to the
prayers of all the saints on the golden altar which was before the throne.”
(Revelation 8:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“In the days of His flesh, He offered up both prayers and
supplications with loud crying and tears to the One able to save Him from
death, and He was heard because of His piety.” (Hebrews 5:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are sacrifices of praise and joy. Jer. 33:11; Jer.
13:15-16; Psalms 50:23; Psalms 27:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the
bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of those who say, &quot;Give
thanks to the LORD of hosts, For the LORD is good, For His lovingkindness is
everlasting&quot;; and of those who bring a thank offering into the house of
the LORD. For I will restore the fortunes of the land as they were at first,'
says the LORD.” (Jeremiah 33:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Listen and give heed, do not be haughty, For the LORD has
spoken. Give glory to the LORD your God, Before He brings darkness And before
your feet stumble On the dusky mountains, And while you are hoping for light He
makes it into deep darkness, And turns it into gloom.” (Jeremiah 13:15-16,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;He who offers a sacrifice of thanksgiving honors Me; And
to him who orders his way aright I shall show the salvation of God.&quot;”
(Psalms 50:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And now my head will be lifted up above my enemies around me,
And I will offer in His tent sacrifices with shouts of joy; I will sing, yes, I
will sing praises to the LORD.” (Psalms 27:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer’s life or body is a living and holy sacrifice.
Rom. 12:1; Phil. 2:17; Psalms 51:17; 2 Tim. 4:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to
present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is
your spiritual service of worship.” (Romans 12:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the
sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and share my joy with you all.”
(Philippians 2:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the
time of my departure has come.” (2 Timothy 4:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are better sacrifices in Hebrews 9:23 and continual
sacrifices in Hebrews 10:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore it was necessary for the copies of the things in the
heavens to be cleansed with these, but the heavenly things themselves with
better sacrifices than these.” (Hebrews 9:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the Law, since it has only a shadow of the good things to
come and not the very form of things, can never, by the same sacrifices which
they offer continually year by year, make perfect those who draw near.”
(Hebrews 10:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are spiritual sacrifices of the holy priesthood. 1
Peter 2:5; Heb. 8:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“you also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual
house for a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
through Jesus Christ.” (1 Peter 2:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and
sacrifices; so it is necessary that this high priest also have something to
offer.” (Hebrews 8:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Priesthood and Spiritual Maturity </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The priesthood of the believer operates on the basis of the
intake and application of Bible doctrine functioning under the grace apparatus
for perception. The priesthood of the believer operates on the freedom to
exercise positive volition toward use of God's grace resources in the spiritual
life. This freedom comes from the capacity given by <i>epignosis</i> Bible
doctrine in the right lobe of the soul. As the believer matures, the edification
complex of the soul is erected from the accumulation of <i>epignosis</i> Bible
doctrine. Heb. 3:1 through Heb. 4:16; Heb. 6:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And so, having patiently waited, he obtained the promise.”
(Hebrews 6:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 23:5, “My cup overflows” refers to the mature
believer. Also, communion is said to identify with a “cup of blessing” in 1 Corinthians
10:16. This cup overflows in refreshing the needs of others. Water out of the
rock - in 1 Corinthians 10:l-4, we have “all drank the same spiritual drink”
which refers to belief in the Rock, Jesus Christ for salvation. </p>

<p class=Verses>“You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies;
You have anointed my head with oil; My cup overflows.” (Psalms 23:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Is not the cup of blessing which we bless a sharing in the
blood of Christ? Is not the bread which we break a sharing in the body of
Christ?” (1 Corinthians 10:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For I do not want you to be unaware, brethren, that our
fathers were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea; and all were
baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea; and all ate the same spiritual
food; and all drank the same spiritual drink, for they were drinking from a
spiritual rock which followed them; and the rock was Christ.” (1 Corinthians
10:1-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The spiritually maturing believer has maximum freedom to
express their priesthood in wise planning and redeeming the little time we have
on this earth by consistently learning Bible doctrine that reveals God's plan
for our lives. James 4:14-15; Gal. 4:8-9; Gal. 4:13-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow. You
are just a vapor that appears for a little while and then vanishes away.
Instead, you ought to say, &quot;If the Lord wills, we will live and also do
this or that.&quot;” (James 4:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“However at that time, when you did not know God, you were
slaves to those which by nature are no gods. But now that you have come to know
God, or rather to be known by God, how is it that you turn back again to the
weak and worthless elemental things, to which you desire to be enslaved all
over again?” (Galatians 4:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“but you know that it was because of a bodily illness that I
preached the gospel to you the first time; and that which was a trial to you in
my bodily condition you did not despise or loathe, but you received me as an
angel of God, as Christ Jesus Himself.” (Galatians 4:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The spiritually maturing believer must gain a practical
understanding of leadership authority. The believer must become authority
oriented to understand the functions of their priesthood. Heb. 12:25; Heb. 13:7;
Heb. 13:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“See to it that you do not refuse Him who is speaking. For if
those did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, much less
will we escape who turn away from Him who warns from heaven.” (Hebrews 12:25,
NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“Remember those who led you, who spoke the word of God to you;
and considering the result of their conduct, imitate their faith.” (Hebrews
13:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch over
your souls as those who will give an account. Let them do this with joy and not
with grief, for this would be unprofitable for you.” (Hebrews 13:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Church Age believer-priest must learn grace and gain
a gratitude for God’s grace blessings  and to depend on God's grace resources
to live the spiritual life. Heb. 12:28.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, since we receive a kingdom which cannot be shaken,
let us show gratitude, by which we may offer to God an acceptable service with
reverence and awe;” (Hebrews 12:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The spiritually maturing believer must make their top
priority the daily assembly to hear face to face teaching if Bible doctrine. The
mature believer-priest gains a true understanding of academic intake and a true
understanding of belief followed by application. Heb. 10:25.</p>

<p class=Verses>“not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of
some, but encouraging one another; and all the more as you see the day drawing
near.” (Hebrews 10:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is a bias in the old sin nature which wants to
spurn God's grace and go back to the ways of the unbeliever in carnality and
even reversionism. Gal. 3:1-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“You foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, before whose
eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified? This is the only thing I
want to find out from you: did you receive the Spirit by the works of the Law,
or by hearing with faith? Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are
you now being perfected by the flesh?” (Galatians 3:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer’s priesthood is based on faith in the
revealed Word of God as taught in the local church by their pastor-teacher.
Heb. 11:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who
comes to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who
seek Him.” (Hebrews 11:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The priesthood of the believer includes a true
understanding of suffering - deserved and undeserved. Heb. 12:1-2; Heb. 12:3; Heb.
12:7-8; Heb. 12:10-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses
surrounding us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so
easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before
us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the
joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at
the right hand of the throne of God.” (Hebrews 12:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For consider Him who has endured such hostility by sinners
against Himself, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.” (Hebrews
12:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“It is for discipline that you endure; God deals with you as
with sons; for what son is there whom his father does not discipline? But if
you are without discipline, of which all have become partakers, then you are
illegitimate children and not sons.” (Hebrews 12:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to
them, but He disciplines us for our good, so that we may share His holiness.
All discipline for the moment seems not to be joyful, but sorrowful; yet to
those who have been trained by it, afterwards it yields the peaceful fruit of
righteousness.” (Hebrews 12:10-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual maturity results in the function of your spiritual
gift(s) whether you realize it or not.  Heb. 10:23-24. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering,
for He who promised is faithful; and let us consider how to stimulate one
another to love and good deeds,” (Hebrews 10:23-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Old Testament, a priest was always very involved
in overt activity. He was always in contact with people, ministering to others.
Heb. 5:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For every high priest taken from among men is appointed on
behalf of men in things pertaining to God, in order to offer both gifts and
sacrifices for sins; he can deal gently with the ignorant and misguided, since
he himself also is beset with weakness;” (Hebrews 5:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Old Testament priests always functioned on a daily basis.
They always knew what to do and were mature spiritually. A priest functioned
volitionally although under commandments. Every priestly function in the Old
Testament has its grace fulfillment today. The Church Age believer in spiritual
maturity has developed divine norms and standards so the volition has something
objective on which to operate.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The mature believer-priest will endure, retain the status
quo in rough going, and never make hasty decisions of a geographical nature. The
mature believer-priest has maximum skill in tying together the divine
institutions with basic and more advanced doctrines. The mature believer has
excellent insight in freedom in personal, family and national living. The
mature believer has excellent spiritual leadership in marriage and family. The
mature believer also has an uncanny sense of discernment in the matter of
voting, taxation, politics, and governmental decisions.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The spiritually mature believer-priest does a maximum
amount of time thinking and a minimum amount of time talking. The greatest
sacrifice a believer can make is that of their own personal viewpoint in order
to agree with God’s viewpoint. Why? The dearest thing to any human being is
their own personal viewpoint. James 1:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“This you know, my beloved brethren. But everyone must be quick
to hear, slow to speak and slow to anger;” (James 1:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every believer in the Church Age is a believer priest,
male, female, regardless of spiritual gift, regardless of growth, but only
functions properly in maturity. A believer-priest has maximum balance between
academic intake and application intent. You cannot apply what you do not know. Ignorance
has no premium with God. 1 Cor. 12:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I do not want you to
be unaware.” (1 Corinthians 12:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To know something you must find someone who knows
something. Seek a qualified and prepared pastor-teacher who will teach you Bible
doctrine. The spiritual learning process moves from the known to the unknown.
New knowledge is built on old knowledge or understood knowledge. 1 Cor. 12:2-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“You know that when you were pagans, you were led astray to the
mute idols, however you were led. Therefore I make known to you that no one
speaking by the Spirit of God says, &quot;Jesus is accursed&quot;; and no one
can say, &quot;Jesus is Lord,&quot; except by the Holy Spirit.” (1 Corinthians
12:2-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You do not learn truth Bible doctrine merely to fill up
the mind with facts, but to use and apply what is learned. When you live in the
Word or function under the grace apparatus for perception, spiritual phenomena
or facts in the human spirit are transferred by the Holy Spirit to the left
lobe of the mentality of the soul. Then, the believer must believe that
understood Bible doctrine (<i>gnosis</i>) before the Holy Spirit can then
transfer it to the right lobe of the soul or the heart as <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine now ready for erecting the edification complex of the soul and
application to life. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Otherwise, the Word of God becomes manna that is not
gathered for use. Manna given by God. Manna on the ground. Manna gathered.
Manna in the tent. Manna in the mouth. If the Word of God is treated as human
knowledge, human facts, then it puffs up becoming only an academic detail of
life. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 8:1, “makes arrogant” is the present
active indicative of <span lang=EL>φυσιο</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(phusioō) and means bellows, to inflate, to puff up, a term for false growth. It
refers to a mental attitude not compatible with the thinking of God. <i>Phusioō</i>
is always used in the bad sense in the Scriptures and refers to false religious
production that is inconsistent. <i>Phusioō</i> is used of believers who
prostitute doctrines and production which, in turn produces a false similarity
to true Christian living. This puffed-up concept expressed itself in mental
attitude, word, and deed.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now concerning things sacrificed to idols, we know that we all
have knowledge. Knowledge makes arrogant, but love edifies.” (1 Corinthians
8:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A structure built on human concepts of Scripture, ethics
and peer evaluation is a false concept of spiritual growth. It is a growth
built upon academic facts with no Holy Spirit transfer to the right lobe of the
soul. There is no <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine for application. It results
in a self-righteous believer that thinks quite highly of themselves with a
large amount of program, hustle, and nervousness. The filling of the Holy Spirit
is God’s absolute standard for true spiritual growth. Proper application of the
Word is always having its proper impact in the work-a-day world. 1 Cor. 8:3;
Rom. 8:28.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but if anyone loves God, he is known by Him.” (1 Corinthians
8:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And we know that God causes all things to work together for
good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.”
(Romans 8:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The doctrine of the priesthood of the believer is important
to understand from salvation and onward to spiritual maturity. It is the Bible doctrine
that ties us to practical Christian living. 1 Peter 2:1-2; 1 Peter 2:5. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, putting aside all malice and all deceit and
hypocrisy and envy and all slander, like newborn babies, long for the pure milk
of the word, so that by it you may grow in respect to salvation,” (1 Peter
2:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“you also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual
house for a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
through Jesus Christ.” (1 Peter 2:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God’s Plan for the Believer’s Stability</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God's truth is an absolute. Therefore, grace is an
absolute. Spiritual growth is true progress. Spiritual maturity is the highest
goal in life. People are born again equal with the same spiritual provisions.
Grace friendships are very important and are formed by grace function through
fellowship.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The majority is not always right, nor is the minority
always wrong. Divine establishment stands as an absolute toward crime. Warfare
will always exist until the Millennium. Each nation must be self-supporting,
self-propagating, and self-governing, with maximum freedom, privacy and
prosperity. The earth’s resources are to be used, but not abused.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The spiritually maturing believer learns and applies
Bible doctrine through the grace apparatus for perception resulting in
application to life using the filling of the Holy Spirit. The Word of God teaches
how the believer can relax in the promises of God. They can handle the
pressures of life that come using God's grace resources. The maturing believer
progressively measures up in the Angelic Conflict as a witness for Jesus
Christ. Such believers can remain patient and calm in the storms of life
confident of God's promises and His grace provision. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The spiritually maturing believer daily approaches God
the Father in prayer confident of the plan of God for their life. This gives
the believer objectivity in the spiritual life with maximum divine viewpoint
thinking. The spiritually maturing believer has a relaxed mental attitude under
conditions where others do not and cannot. They know that living the Christian
life does not depend upon who and what they are, but who and what God is. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritually maturing believers think divine viewpoint as
a direct result of knowing the essence of God and categorical Bible doctrine. They
are able to mix points of Bible doctrine with other doctrines in their soul’s
frame of reference. They recognize the plan of God for their life and agree
with God as to the best Christian way of life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritually maturing believers see human needs around them
and orient to those needs in their mental attitude in such a way that they can
stay objective and think as God thinks without the coloring of the thinking by
emotions, revenge, or spite. Such believers can pray for those needs by asking

faithfulness of God as seen daily. They express by prayer and mental attitude
love their personal dependence upon the grace provided to function in the

Conflict as to God’s plan and His Word, to the essence of God, to the function
of the believer priest, and to the function of their spiritual gift.                              </p>
