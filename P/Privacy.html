<h2><a name="_Privacy"></a>Privacy</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Privacy is the quality or state of being apart from
company or observation by others and is freedom from unauthorized intrusion. It
is that aspect of human freedom that allows seclusion from others when desired.
The laws of divine establishment provide for the privacy of believers and
unbelievers so that they can make decisions without coercion. For the believer,
there is additional privacy to allow every believer priest to fulfill the plan
of God for their lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The doctrine of privacy includes textual analysis of
terms relating to privacy, secrecy, and concealment and has been synthesized
into the category of privacy. In Matthew 6:4-6, the Greek word for “secrecy” is
<span lang=EL>κρυπτός</span> (kruptos) and means hidden, concealed, secret. In
Matthew 6:18, the Greek word is similar <span lang=EL>κρυφαῖος</span>
(kruphaios) and means hidden, secret.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; so that your giving will be in secret; and your Father
who sees what is done in secret will reward you. &quot;When you pray, you are
not to be like the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the
synagogues and on the street corners so that they may be seen by men. Truly I
say to you, they have their reward in full. &quot;But you, when you pray, go
into your inner room, close your door and pray to your Father who is in secret,
and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you. &quot; 
(Matthew 6:4-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; so that your fasting will not be noticed by men, but by
your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees what is done in secret
will reward you. &quot;  (Matthew 6:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Privacy Related to Giving</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Privacy is related to giving to get the recognition and
praise of man and is forbidden. Privacy is related to giving being a matter of
privacy of the individual. In the time of Christ, giving was done in the
synagogues and in the streets. The synagogue was the normal place of giving.
The streets were the spontaneous place of giving. The street provided the
opportunity to express grace and mercy in action, but this was abused.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Giving in privacy is only privacy before man. Giving is
never privacy from God. Often the privacy of the believer is used to conceal their
misapplication of the grace principle. Just as people move to a large city to
get lost in the multitudes or go to a large church to get lost in the privacy
of the masses, privacy in giving, therefore, can become a gimmick for people.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Privacy in giving is not a matter of concealment from
others, but rather the issue of motive for you. Privacy in giving is the
expression of a proper mental attitude toward giving. If you want others to
see, you are violating your own privacy.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Privacy Related to Prayer</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Privacy in prayer is not related as much to the technique
of prayer as your motivation in prayer. Praying in context of Matthew 6 was
abused. These people were attempting to impress others in their prayers. The
prayers were done in the synagogues and also on the street corners. These were
the expression in the normal place and the unusual place. In context, the ones
involved wanted not only to impress the “folks at church,” but also the
outsiders.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Privacy in prayer does not mean the negation of public
prayer. Public prayer for man’s praise and commendation is what is forbidden.
So privacy is often abused in prayer.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Privacy Related to Fasting</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Fasting was the practice of abstaining from the normal
course of eating to accomplish a spiritual objective. It was sometimes long of
duration and sometimes short. Privacy was maintained in fasting by keeping up
your normal appearance and not calling attention to the fact before men that
you were fasting. Here again, like giving and praying, fasting was distorted
and the whole privacy concept was missing.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Privacy Related to Production of the Believer</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We have seen that privacy is related to giving, praying
and fasting. These all fall into the category of spiritual production. Here we
see one of the significant factors in the doctrine of privacy. That is, it
chiefly relates to the believer’s production. Nothing is said here of privacy
from the rule of those over you or concealment of your activities under rank or
authority.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Privacy is related to the production of the believer in
giving, praying, fasting, laying up reward, etc. Privacy is rebuked in the
matter of hiding your production, or expecting it to have effects when covered
up. Matt. 6:4-18; Luke 8:17; Luke 11:33.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;For nothing is hidden that will not become
evident, nor anything secret that will not be known and come to light. &quot; 
(Luke 8:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;No one, after lighting a lamp, puts it away in a
cellar nor under a basket, but on the lampstand, so that those who enter may
see the light. &quot;  (Luke 11:33, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Privacy needs to be maintained when it is not yet time to
manifest your ministry. Privacy needs to be used correctly even when the time
is right. John 7:4; John 7:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;For no one does anything in secret when he himself
seeks to be known publicly. If You do these things, show Yourself to the
world.&quot;&quot;  (John 7:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But when His brothers had gone up to the feast, then He
Himself also went up, not publicly, but as if, in secret.&quot;  (John 7:10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Privacy and its use does not need or should not cause a
guilt complex. The privacy of mankind, unbelievers in context, will be revealed
at the judgment day. John 18:20; Rom. 2:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Jesus answered him, &quot;I have spoken openly to the
world; I always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all the Jews come
together; and I spoke nothing in secret. &quot;  (John 18:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;on the day when, according to my gospel, God will judge
the secrets of men through Christ Jesus.&quot;  (Romans 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The privacy of the heart of an individual will be
revealed by the communication of someone communicating the Word of God. God
knows the secret, private, and hidden things of the heart. 1 Cor. 14:25; Psalms
44:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;the secrets of his heart are disclosed; and so he will
fall on his face and worship God, declaring that God is certainly among
you.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 14:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Would not God find this out? For He knows the secrets of
the heart.&quot;  (Psalms 44:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are things God reserves for Himself, privately,
that He chooses to not reveal to us. Deut. 29:29; Psalms 19:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;The secret things belong to the LORD our God, but
the things revealed belong to us and to our sons forever, that we may observe
all the words of this law.&quot;  (Deuteronomy 29:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Who can discern his errors? Acquit me of hidden faults.
&quot;  (Psalms 19:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The doctrine of privacy is not to be used as a cover for
sin. In the privacy of individuals, much ill has been done to people. That
which is done in secret, or in privacy, God often decrees to reveal openly.
Mark 4:22; Deut. 27:24; 2 Sam. 12:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;For nothing is hidden, except to be revealed; nor
has anything been secret, but that it would come to light. &quot;  (Mark 4:22,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;'Cursed is he who strikes his neighbor in secret.' And
all the people shall say, 'Amen.'&quot;  (Deuteronomy 27:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;'Indeed you did it secretly, but I will do this thing
before all Israel, and under the sun.'&quot;&quot;  (2 Samuel 12:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Privacy often is wisely expressed in caution because of
the character of the surrounding people. Often you must be discreet and silent
around people who are likely to mistake your speech and pass around their false
analysis. Privacy is used to conceal sinful actions. John 19:39; 2 Kings 17:9;
1 Sam. 23:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Nicodemus, who had first come to Him by night, also came,
bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds weight. &quot; 
(John 19:39, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The sons of Israel did things secretly which were not
right against the LORD their God. Moreover, they built for themselves high
places in all their towns, from watchtower to fortified city.&quot;  (2 Kings
17:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now David knew that Saul was plotting evil against him;
so he said to Abiathar the priest, &quot;Bring the ephod here.&quot;&quot;  (1
Samuel 23:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Important matters need to be reserved for private
explanation. Matt. 24:3; Matt. 9:28; Matt. 13:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;As He was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples
came to Him privately, saying, &quot;Tell us, when will these things happen,
and what will be the sign of Your coming, and of the end of the
age?&quot;&quot;  (Matthew 24:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When He entered the house, the blind men came up to Him,
and Jesus said to them, &quot;Do you believe that I am able to do this?&quot;
They said to Him, &quot;Yes, Lord.&quot;&quot;  (Matthew 9:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He spoke many things to them in parables, saying,
&quot;Behold, the sower went out to sow; &quot;  (Matthew 13:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Privacy has been the factor in saving the life or has
brought great benefit to another person. Privacy has been used to produce the
desired effect to a deed done. Acts 23:19; 1 Sam. 24:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The commander took him by the hand and stepping aside,
began to inquire of him privately, &quot;What is it that you have to report to
me?&quot;&quot;  (Acts 23:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The men of David said to him, &quot;Behold, this is the
day of which the LORD said to you, 'Behold; I am about to give your enemy into
your hand, and you shall do to him as it seems good to you.'&quot; Then David
arose and cut off the edge of Saul's robe secretly.&quot;  (1 Samuel 24:4,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The use of your privacy to protect your slander just
won’t work. God sees and He will judge anyway. The old idea that no one will
ever see or know who said it doesn’t hold water. Privacy is used by apostates
to come into a group to despoil it and often they express great patience in
silence waiting until the time is just right to reveal themselves. Psalms 101:5;
2 Peter 2:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Whoever secretly slanders his neighbor, him I will
destroy; No one who has a haughty look and an arrogant heart will I
endure.&quot;  (Psalms 101:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But false prophets also arose among the people, just as
there will also be false teachers among you, who will secretly introduce
destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing swift
destruction upon themselves.&quot;  (2 Peter 2:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The privacy of dignitaries has often been used to add
authority to the announcements of the individual. If you say you were talking
with so and so and they said a certain thing, a person listening might give
heed or they may not. If you come from the same thing and call it a private
conference, then you have great attention. It is forbidden to fellowship with
the private evils of others. Matt. 24:26; Eph. 5:11-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;So if they say to you, 'Behold, He is in the
wilderness,' do not go out, or, 'Behold, He is in the inner rooms,' do not
believe them. &quot;  (Matthew 24:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness,
but instead even expose them; for it is disgraceful even to speak of the things
which are done by them in secret.&quot;  (Ephesians 5:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is proper to reveal or manifest the evil of others as
the light makes it manifest. Bible doctrine reveals the evils, works of
darkness done in the privacy of the individual’s lives. Eph. 5:12-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;for it is disgraceful even to speak of the things which
are done by them in secret. But all things become visible when they are exposed
by the light, for everything that becomes visible is light.&quot;  (Ephesians
5:12-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Wrong Use of Privacy by Failing to use it</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Privacy has first been related to the production of the
believer in giving, praying, and fasting. In Matthew 6:1-19, spiritual
production in privacy before the Lord brings eternal rewards. Human good
production done in the sight of man only brings man’s praise. The human wages
for production done before men are their smiles of approval, their commendation
of your person, your reputation gets a boost, and your influence is enhanced. Rev.
3:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;To the angel of the church in Sardis write: He who
has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars, says this: 'I know your
deeds, that you have a name that you are alive, but you are dead. 'Wake up, and
strengthen the things that remain, which were about to die; for I have not
found your deeds completed in the sight of My God. &quot;  (Revelation 3:1-2,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>These “clothes” of righteousness are eaten away by the
moth and corrosion. To lay up for yourselves treasures upon earth is to
accumulate all these gems of praise, commendation, approval, appreciation, etc.
and to have them swallowed up when a little adversity comes along.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor is great, the teaching is wonderful, all
people are for you, even the Lord seems to be so, then the bottom drops out. Do
you thrive on the continued support of someone’s encouragement? As long as they
keep saying you are doing fine and you can make it, you do thrive. But just as
soon as they begin to give better analysis, you fall apart. To lay up treasure
in heaven is found by a proper use of privacy in spiritual production.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Privacy and Spiritual Production</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Covering your spiritual production in false humility is
wrong. Matt. 5:14-16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;You are the light of the world. A city set on a
hill cannot be hidden; nor does anyone light a lamp and put it under a basket,
but on the lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house. &quot;Let
your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works,
and glorify your Father who is in heaven. &quot;  (Matthew 5:14-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Light has several meanings in the Greek. The word <span
lang=EL>φῶς</span> (phōs) and means light as seen by the eyes, an organ
adapted for reception. Man in salvation has received the spiritual organ of
reception. In Luke 16:8, believers are called “sons of light” and means a
light, primarily a light giver, one that produces light.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;And his master praised the unrighteous manager
because he had acted shrewdly; for the sons of this age are more shrewd in
relation to their own kind than the sons of light. &quot;  (Luke 16:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Light is used of believers in Philippians 2:15 and used
of Christ in Revelation 21:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and
innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse
generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world,&quot;  (Philippians
2:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And the city has no need of the sun or of the moon to
shine on it, for the glory of God has illumined it, and its lamp is the
Lamb.&quot;  (Revelation 21:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 4:6, light used as an illumination of
the Gospel. Here, light is <span lang=EL>φωτισμός</span> (phōtismos) and
means <span style='background:white'>the act of enlightening or illumination.</span></p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For God, who said, &quot;Light shall shine out of
darkness,&quot; is the One who has shone in our hearts to give the Light of the
knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 4:6,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 24:29, <span lang=EL>φέγγος</span> (pheggos)
is used of the light of the moon. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;But immediately after the tribulation of those
days THE SUN WILL BE DARKENED, AND THE MOON WILL NOT GIVE ITS LIGHT, AND THE
STARS WILL FALL from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
&quot;  (Matthew 24:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The use of light in Matthew 5:14 is <span lang=EL>φῶς</span>
(phōs) implies that those benefitting will have a capacity of reception,
therefore, ability to benefit from it. Therefore, production here is described
as “light” which other believers will be able to see and respond to.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;You are the light of the world. A city set on a
hill cannot be hidden; &quot;  (Matthew 5:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 5:15, “lamp” is <span lang=EL>λύχνος</span>
(luchnos) and refers to a hand-lamp. The term “to give light” is <span lang=EL>λάμπω</span>
(lampō) and means to illuminate so as to see. The basket was a clay earthen
pot used to store flour and was placed under the lampstand. The lampstand was a
protrusion from the wall upon which the lamp was put that the light might
provide light for all that enter the room. The room is the sphere around a
believer in their spiritual production. This would be a pastor and his
congregation, a teacher and their class, a manager in their business. The
lampstand is the location of your spiritual production.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; nor does anyone light a lamp and put it under a basket,
but on the lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house. &quot; 
(Matthew 5:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 5:16, the purpose for the lamp and the
lampstand is that others may see by producing “light” to all in the house. “That
they may see” is the aorist active subjunctive of <span lang=EL>ὁράω</span>
(horaō) and means to perceive, discern, notice, pay attention to. “Good” is <span
lang=EL>καλός</span> (kalos) and means excellent in that it is so constructed
to answer the purpose for which it was created. “Works” is <span lang=EL>ἔργον</span>
(ergon) and is a noble action in this context. “Glorify” is the aorist active
subjunctive of <span lang=EL>δοξάζω</span> (doxazō) and means to magnify,
praise, honor. The purpose being that they might give honor to God.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;Let your light shine before men in such a way that
they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven. &quot; 
(Matthew 5:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Therefore, to cover your production or veil it in
privacy, you keep others from the benefits of your spiritual production of
giving proper glory and honor to God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Light Reveals Evil</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Light is seen in a new way as a revealer of evil. Mark
4:21; Luke 8:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He was saying to them, &quot;A lamp is not brought to
be put under a basket, is it, or under a bed? Is it not brought to be put on
the lampstand? &quot;  (Mark 4:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;Now no one after lighting a lamp covers it over
with a container, or puts it under a bed; but he puts it on a lampstand, so
that those who come in may see the light. &quot;  (Luke 8:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The production of the believer is designed to expose the
evil, to make it manifest. Titus 1:9-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;holding fast the faithful word which is in accordance
with the teaching, so that he will be able both to exhort in sound doctrine and
to refute those who contradict. For there are many rebellious men, empty
talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision, who must be
silenced because they are upsetting whole families, teaching things they should
not teach for the sake of sordid gain.&quot;  (Titus 1:9-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Purpose of light is to make manifest that which was
hidden. Mark 4:22; Luke 8:16-17; Eph. 5:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;For nothing is hidden, except to be revealed; nor
has anything been secret, but that it would come to light. &quot;  (Mark 4:22,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;Now no one after lighting a lamp covers it over
with a container, or puts it under a bed; but he puts it on a lampstand, so
that those who come in may see the light. &quot;For nothing is hidden that will
not become evident, nor anything secret that will not be known and come to
light. &quot;  (Luke 8:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But all things become visible when they are exposed by
the light, for everything that becomes visible is light.&quot;  (Ephesians
5:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Here we see that not only are the things (secret sins) of
others manifested by the production of the believer, but they are reproved by
it. The light reproves as well as manifests. For a believer to cover, conceal,
or neutralize their spiritual production, the light fails to reprove the secret
sins of the other individual. In Ephesians 5:13, “exposed” is <span lang=EL>ἐλέγχω</span>
(elegchō) and means to show someone their sin and to summon them to
repentance. It implies educative discipline.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Privacy and Concealment of Sin </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Privacy is related to the production of the believer,
both in the positive sense and in the negative sense. There is a time not to
use it and there is a time to use it. When the believer’s production relates to
rewards and they fails to use privacy, they will receive human rewards instead
of God’s rewards.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The human reward falls into four areas - the smile of
approval, the commendation of your person, your reputation gets a boost, and
your influence is enhanced. There are two basic ways to wrongly use privacy in
production, in relation to concealing your production. Covering your production
in a false humility and covering your production to take the edge off its
effectiveness.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Examples of using privacy to conceal sin.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Types of sins either done in secret or concealed in
secret after doing them. Disobedience to God’s command. Adam eating the fruit.
Killing. Cain killing Abel. Stealing - Achan. Idol worship - Israel. Conspiring
against another person - Saul against David. Slander.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Adam concealed himself in the garden after the fall. Gen.
3:8; Job. 31:33.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;They heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the
garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the
presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden.&quot;  (Genesis 3:8,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Have I covered my transgressions like Adam, By
hiding my iniquity in my bosom,&quot;  (Job 31:33, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Cain conceals his sin with an appeal to his
responsibilities. Gen. 4:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then the LORD said to Cain, &quot;Where is Abel your
brother?&quot; And he said, &quot;I do not know. Am I my brother's
keeper?&quot;&quot;  (Genesis 4:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Achan stole the articles in the Canaan conquest and hid
them in the floor of his tent. Joshua 7:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the
land will hear of it, and they will surround us and cut off our name from the
earth. And what will You do for Your great name?&quot;&quot;  (Joshua 7:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Israelites hid in privacy the false gods of their
worship. Deut. 27:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;'Cursed is the man who makes an idol or a molten image,
an abomination to the LORD, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and sets it
up in secret.' And all the people shall answer and say, 'Amen.'&quot; 
(Deuteronomy 27:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Saul secretly fabricated mischief toward David. 1 Sam.
23:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now David knew that Saul was plotting evil against him;
so he said to Abiathar the priest, &quot;Bring the ephod here.&quot;&quot;  (1
Samuel 23:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Israel secretly worshipped false gods and it resulted in
the Assyrian captivity. 2 Kings 17:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The sons of Israel did things secretly which were not
right against the LORD their God. Moreover, they built for themselves high
places in all their towns, from watchtower to fortified city.&quot;  (2 Kings
17:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Privacy used in the concealment of the slander of a
neighbor. Psalms 101:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Whoever secretly slanders his neighbor, him I will
destroy; No one who has a haughty look and an arrogant heart will I
endure.&quot;  (Psalms 101:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>People trust in privacy or darkness to cover them. Psalms
139:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If I say, &quot;Surely the darkness will overwhelm me,
And the light around me will be night,&quot;&quot;  (Psalms 139:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>People enjoy the privacy of darkness because their deeds
are evil. John 3:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;This is the judgment, that the Light has come into
the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds
were evil. &quot;  (John 3:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Things done in concealment have a way of bringing torment
for the constant fear of being exposed. It produces a false rapport between you
and the person you are afraid of. Luke 12:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;Accordingly, whatever you have said in the dark
will be heard in the light, and what you have whispered in the inner rooms will
be proclaimed upon the housetops. &quot;  (Luke 12:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Hebrew Words Defining Concealment in the Old Testament
</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One Hebrew term for “secretly” is the same term for the
“overlay” of the gold in the temple. This is the doctrine of veneer. One of the
ways that the sins of people are hidden is to cover them up with sweetness and
light, something very beautiful and attractive. There are seven roots in the
Hebrew and eight auxiliary words that define the matter of “concealment” in the
Old Testament.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Isaiah 26:20, “hide” is <span lang=AR-SA dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>חבה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span>
(châbâh) and means to “withdraw into privacy” of Israel, the spies hiding
themselves for three days in Joshua 2:16, and Edom concealing himself from
judgment in Jeremiah 49:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Come, my people, enter into your rooms And close your
doors behind you; Hide for a little while Until indignation runs its
course.&quot;  (Isaiah 26:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;She said to them, &quot;Go to the hill country, so that
the pursuers will not happen upon you, and hide yourselves there for three days
until the pursuers return. Then afterward you may go on your way.&quot;&quot; 
(Joshua 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;But I have stripped Esau bare, I have uncovered his
hiding places So that he will not be able to conceal himself; His offspring has
been destroyed along with his relatives And his neighbors, and he is no
more.&quot;  (Jeremiah 49:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 9:15, Psalms 35:7-8, and Jeremiah 13:5, “hid”
is <span lang=AR-SA dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>טמן</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (ṭâman) and means to hide or conceal. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The nations have sunk down in the pit which they have
made; In the net which they hid, their own foot has been caught.&quot;  (Psalms
9:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For without cause they hid their net for me; Without
cause they dug a pit for my soul. Let destruction come upon him unawares, And
let the net which he hid catch himself; Into that very destruction let him
fall.&quot;  (Psalms 35:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So I went and hid it by the Euphrates, as the LORD had
commanded me.&quot;  (Jeremiah 13:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Job 27:11 and Jeremiah 50:2, “conceal” is <span
lang=AR-SA dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>כּחד</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> (kâchad) and means to completely destroy, to conceal, to
desolate, to hide. Here is means to conceal or hide.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;I will instruct you in the power of God; What is
with the Almighty I will not conceal.&quot;  (Job 27:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Declare and proclaim among the nations. Proclaim it
and lift up a standard. Do not conceal it but say, 'Babylon has been captured,
Bel has been put to shame, Marduk has been shattered; Her images have been put
to shame, her idols have been shattered.'&quot;  (Jeremiah 50:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hosea 10:8, “cover” and in Proverbs 28:13, “conceal”
are <span lang=AR-SA dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>כּסה</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (kâsâh) and means to conceal, to cover,
to hide. In Hosea 10:8, they wanted the mountains to hide them from God.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Also the high places of Aven, the sin of Israel, will be
destroyed; Thorn and thistle will grow on their altars; Then they will say to
the mountains, &quot;Cover us!&quot; And to the hills, &quot;Fall on
us!&quot;&quot;  (Hosea 10:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He who conceals his transgressions will not prosper, But
he who confesses and forsakes them will find compassion.&quot;  (Proverbs
28:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Jeremiah 16:17, “hidden” is <span lang=AR-SA dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>סתר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span>
(sâthar) means to hide oneself, to escape God’s notice.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;For My eyes are on all their ways; they are not
hidden from My face, nor is their iniquity concealed from My eyes.&quot; 
(Jeremiah 16:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 26:4, “pretenders” is <span lang=AR-SA dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>עלם</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span>
(‛âlam) and means to conceal, to secret, to veil from sight. This refers to
those who conceal their thoughts.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I do not sit with deceitful men, Nor will I go with
pretenders.&quot;  (Psalms 26:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 2:1 and Proverbs 7:1, “treasure” is <span
lang=AR-SA dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>צפן</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> (tsâphan) and means hide or treasure up.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;My son, if you will receive my words And treasure my
commandments within you,&quot;  (Proverbs 2:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;My son, keep my words And treasure my commandments within
you.&quot;  (Proverbs 7:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Methods by which the concealment was carried out or
how the privacy of the sin was maintained.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Maintaining the privacy of your sin by isolating yourself
by going into hiding. Gen. 3:8; Job 31:33; John 3:19-20.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;They heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the
garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the
presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden.&quot;  (Genesis 3:8,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Have I covered my transgressions like Adam, By
hiding my iniquity in my bosom,&quot;  (Job 31:33, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;This is the judgment, that the Light has come into
the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds
were evil. &quot;For everyone who does evil hates the Light, and does not come
to the Light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. &quot;  (John 3:19-20,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Maintaining privacy of your sin by veneering it over. 2
Kings 17:9; Prov. 26:26; 2 Chron. 3:5-9; Psalms 90:8; Psalms 26:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The sons of Israel did things secretly which were not
right against the LORD their God. Moreover, they built for themselves high
places in all their towns, from watchtower to fortified city.&quot;  (2 Kings
17:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; Though his hatred covers itself with guile, His
wickedness will be revealed before the assembly.&quot;  (Proverbs 26:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He overlaid the main room with cypress wood and overlaid
it with fine gold, and ornamented it with palm trees and chains. Further, he
adorned the house with precious stones; and the gold was gold from Parvaim. He
also overlaid the house with gold—the beams, the thresholds and its walls and
its doors; and he carved cherubim on the walls. Now he made the room of the
holy of holies: its length across the width of the house was twenty cubits, and
its width was twenty cubits; and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to
600 talents. The weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. He also
overlaid the upper rooms with gold.&quot;  (2 Chronicles 3:5-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;You have placed our iniquities before You, Our secret
sins in the light of Your presence.&quot;  (Psalms 90:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I do not sit with deceitful men, Nor will I go with
pretenders.&quot;  (Psalms 26:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Maintaining privacy of your sin by merging it with truth.
Titus 1:14; 2 Peter 2:1; 2 Peter 2:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;not paying attention to Jewish myths and commandments of
men who turn away from the truth.&quot;  (Titus 1:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But false prophets also arose among the people, just as
there will also be false teachers among you, who will secretly introduce
destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing swift
destruction upon themselves.&quot;  (2 Peter 2:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For speaking out arrogant words of vanity they entice by
fleshly desires, by sensuality, those who barely escape from the ones who live
in error,&quot;  (2 Peter 2:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Maintaining privacy of your sin by disguising yourself. 1
Kings 14:2; Job 24:15-17; Gen. 27:11-12; Gen. 27:16; 2 Sam. 13:1-3; Gal. 2:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Jeroboam said to his wife, &quot;Arise now, and disguise
yourself so that they will not know that you are the wife of Jeroboam, and go
to Shiloh; behold, Ahijah the prophet is there, who spoke concerning me that I
would be king over this people.&quot;  (1 Kings 14:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;The eye of the adulterer waits for the twilight,
Saying, 'No eye will see me.' And he disguises his face. &quot;In the dark they
dig into houses, They shut themselves up by day; They do not know the light.
&quot;For the morning is the same to him as thick darkness, For he is familiar
with the terrors of thick darkness.&quot;  (Job 24:15-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Jacob answered his mother Rebekah, &quot;Behold, Esau my
brother is a hairy man and I am a smooth man. &quot;Perhaps my father will feel
me, then I will be as a deceiver in his sight, and I will bring upon myself a
curse and not a blessing.&quot;&quot;  (Genesis 27:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And she put the skins of the young goats on his hands and
on the smooth part of his neck.&quot;  (Genesis 27:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now it was after this that Absalom the son of David had a
beautiful sister whose name was Tamar, and Amnon the son of David loved her.
Amnon was so frustrated because of his sister Tamar that he made himself ill,
for she was a virgin, and it seemed hard to Amnon to do anything to her. But
Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David's brother;
and Jonadab was a very shrewd man.&quot;  (2 Samuel 13:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But it was because of the false brethren secretly brought
in, who had sneaked in to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, in
order to bring us into bondage.&quot;  (Galatians 2:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Maintaining privacy of your sin by having some friend
deceive another person in conversation. 1 Sam. 18:22; Rom. 16:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then Saul commanded his servants, &quot;Speak to David
secretly, saying, 'Behold, the king delights in you, and all his servants love
you; now therefore, become the king's son-in-law.'&quot;&quot;  (1 Samuel
18:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For such men are slaves, not of our Lord Christ but of
their own appetites; and by their smooth and flattering speech they deceive the
hearts of the unsuspecting.&quot;  (Romans 16:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Results caused by the concealment of sin</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Torment of fear. Gen. 3:10; Luke 12:1-3; Prov. 1:26-27;
Isaiah 44:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He said, &quot;I heard the sound of You in the garden,
and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid myself.&quot;&quot;  (Genesis
3:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Under these circumstances, after so many thousands of
people had gathered together that they were stepping on one another, He began
saying to His disciples first of all, &quot;Beware of the leaven of the
Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. &quot;But there is nothing covered up that will
not be revealed, and hidden that will not be known. &quot;Accordingly, whatever
you have said in the dark will be heard in the light, and what you have
whispered in the inner rooms will be proclaimed upon the housetops. &quot; 
(Luke 12:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I will also laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your
dread comes, When your dread comes like a storm And your calamity comes like a
whirlwind, When distress and anguish come upon you.&quot;  (Proverbs 1:26-27,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Those who fashion a graven image are all of them futile,
and their precious things are of no profit; even their own witnesses fail to
see or know, so that they will be put to shame.&quot;  (Isaiah 44:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>False rapport. Jer. 42:1-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then all the commanders of the forces, Johanan the son of
Kareah, Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people both small and great
approached and said to Jeremiah the prophet, &quot;Please let our petition come
before you, and pray for us to the LORD your God, that is for all this remnant;
because we are left but a few out of many, as your own eyes now see us, that
the LORD your God may tell us the way in which we should walk and the thing
that we should do.&quot; Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them, &quot;I have
heard you. Behold, I am going to pray to the LORD your God in accordance with
your words; and I will tell you the whole message which the LORD will answer
you. I will not keep back a word from you.&quot;&quot;  (Jeremiah 42:1-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Loss of prosperity. Prov. 28:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He who conceals his transgressions will not prosper, But
he who confesses and forsakes them will find compassion.&quot;  (Proverbs

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scar tissue - promiscuity sins. Eph. 4:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So this I say, and affirm together with the Lord, that

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Shame. Jer. 2:26; Gen. 2:25.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;As the thief is shamed when he is discovered, So
the house of Israel is shamed; They, their kings, their princes And their

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Revealing concealed sins or sins of privacy</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All sin will be revealed. Luke 8; Matt. 10:26; Luke 2:35.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;Therefore do not fear them, for there is nothing

(Matthew 10:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and a sword will pierce even your own soul—to the end
that thoughts from many hearts may be revealed.&quot;&quot;  (Luke 2:35, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sin will be revealed at the day of judgment. Rom. 2:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;on the day when, according to my gospel, God will judge
the secrets of men through Christ Jesus.&quot;  (Romans 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sin will be revealed on earth also. By God directly in 2
Samuel 12:12 where the sin was revealed by making the discipline public. The
child died in 2 Samuel 12:14. Amnon rapes Tamar in 2 Samuel 13:1-22. Absalom

<p class=Verses>“But she answered him, &quot;No, my brother, do not violate me,
for such a thing is not done in Israel; do not do this disgraceful thing!
&quot;As for me, where could I get rid of my reproach? And as for you, you will
be like one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, please speak to the king,
for he will not withhold me from you.&quot; However, he would not listen to
her; since he was stronger than she, he violated her and lay with her.” (2
Samuel 13:12-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sin will be revealed by the communication of doctrine. 1
Cor. 14:25; Prov. 26:26.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;the secrets of his heart are disclosed; and so he will

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Busybody</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A busybody is an invader of privacy, a meddler in other

lot of time on their hands. 2 Thess. 3:11; 1 Tim. 5:13; 1 Peter 4:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For we hear that some among you are leading an
undisciplined life, doing no work at all, but acting like busybodies.&quot;  (2
Thessalonians 3:11, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;At the same time they also learn to be idle, as they go
around from house to house; and not merely idle, but also gossips and
busybodies, talking about things not proper to mention. &quot;  (1 Timothy
5:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Make sure that none of you suffers as a murderer, or
thief, or evildoer, or a troublesome meddler;&quot;  (1 Peter 4:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Busybodies invade the privacy of the homes they visit,
tattling, and passing along gossip. This is troublemaking in its worst form. In
1 Peter 4:15, note the company which surrounds the busybody. Note the “murderer”,
the “thief,” the “evildoer,” and the troublesome meddler.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Invasion of Privacy</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Invasion of privacy is very destructive in a society. This
is mental murder, gossiping, maligning, sins of the tongue - you name it. Why
is privacy so important? Without it freedom is curtailed and people enslave
themselves very easily. Gal. 5:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But if you bite and devour one another, take care that
you are not consumed by one another.&quot;  (Galatians 5:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>However, it is not an invasion of privacy to be concerned
about others, pray for others, and help others. Gal. 6:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Bear one another's burdens, and thereby fulfill the law
of Christ.&quot;  (Galatians 6:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Galatians 6:4-5 is a passgae of caution in that everyone
should become spiritually self-sustaining as soon as possible after becoming a
Christian.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But each one must examine his own work, and then he will
have reason for boasting in regard to himself alone, and not in regard to
another. For each one will bear his own load.&quot;  (Galatians 6:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Conclusions</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The ultimate guardian of privacy in the mature believer,
is the edification complex of  the soul. The believer who functions under the grace
perception and belief of Bible doctrine has the God-given ability to value
privacy personally and towards others. A believer who functions in the
spiritual life is not pushy and does not violate the privacy of others. Eph.
3:13-21; Eph. 4:7-32; Eph. 5:1-33.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 21:14, Paul desired privacy. “We fell silent” is
ἡσυχάζω (hēsuchazō) in the Greek and indicates to live peaceably in a
relaxed manner, to allow someone use of their own volition and privacy. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And since he would not be persuaded, we fell silent,
remarking, &quot;The will of the Lord be done!&quot;&quot;  (Acts 21:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every Church Age believer is a priest and must live their
own life as unto the Lord. To pursue the matter beyond this point would be an
infringement on Paul’s privacy. Paul was wrong and they knew it, but these
people put the matter into the Lord’s hands and let Him deal with Paul. They did
not get in the way of the Lord. Therefore, they stayed out of the Lord’s way by
allowing Paul privacy and freedom of choice.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>So the companions of Paul ceased. They stayed with him
even though they knew he was wrong. He, however, was not apostate. The Lord
will deal with Paul through discipline. The grace of God will eventually
triumph by turning cursing into blessing. The application is to put others in
the Lord’s hands and not interfere with their privacy or volition. This is a
major step toward becoming a mature believer.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 6, privacy is to be used when production is
viewed from the reward standpoint. When privacy is not used, it may indicate a
false attitude towards rewards. In Matthew 5, Luke 8, Mark 4, and Ephesians 5,
production is seen from the standpoint of benefit to others, benefit to God,
and benefit in reproof.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When should privacy be used in production? When your
reward is in view. When should privacy not be used in production? When others
need to benefit by the light, when God is glorified by the light, and when
others need to be reproved by the light.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are three misuses of privacy in this lesson. No use
of privacy in production when there should have been. Matt. 6. A concealing of
production (candle under a bushel). Matt. 5; Luke 8; Mark 4. Concealing of
production, taking the edge off, therefore, your production failing to have the
effect God has designed it to have. Eph. 5:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For this reason it says, &quot;Awake, sleeper, And arise
from the dead, And Christ will shine on you.&quot;&quot;  (Ephesians 5:14,
NASB)</p>
