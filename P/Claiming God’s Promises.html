<h2>Claiming God’s Promises</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One side of the coin is confessing sin biblically. The
other side is claiming the promises of God or utilizing faith-rest. Faith-rest
is habitually claiming the promises of God with the resultant inner peace and
stability that God gives. It is for believers only. It has nothing to do with
the power of positive thinking so prevalent today. Heb. 3:7 - Heb. 4:16; Exodus
17; Num. 20.  See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/F/The%20Faith-Rest%20Life.html">The Faith-Rest
Life.</a></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A few of God's 7,000+ promises in the Bible that are
pertinent to the Christian are listed below. Faith-rest can be exercised in
this way; “Since all things work together for good, I know God has a plan for
my life. Not everything may be good, but it will work together for good. Taking
Romans 8:28 by faith, I can cast my cares upon Him before they even happen and
by faith give thanks for every happenstance, good or bad (from my viewpoint)
because of His plan. After all, the battle is the Lord’s because He is
faithful. I don’t have the spirit of fear because He gives power, love, and
soundness of mind when I continue in fellowship believing His promises. My
mental attitude is stabilized by knowing that if God is for me, who can be
against me? After all, He did the big thing in saving me, how easily He can
take care of my daily living.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God's promises are daily fuel for the faith-rest life.
These are to be used instead of worry! These are to be used upon rising in the
morning and throughout the day. The Christian life can be wonderful by using
God's promises consistently and faithfully. You’ll be glad you did.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And we know that God causes all things to work together
for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His
purpose.&quot;  (Romans 8:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;casting all your anxiety on Him, because He cares for
you.&quot;  (1 Peter 5:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;in everything give thanks; for this is God's will for you
in Christ Jesus.&quot;  (1 Thessalonians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and that all this assembly may know that the LORD does
not deliver by sword or by spear; for the battle is the LORD'S and He will give
you into our hands.&quot;&quot;  (1 Samuel 17:47, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;God is faithful, through whom you were called into
fellowship with His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of
power and love and discipline.&quot;  (2 Timothy 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;And all things you ask in prayer, believing, you
will receive.&quot; &quot;  (Matthew 21:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And my God will supply all your needs according to His
riches in glory in Christ Jesus.&quot;  (Philippians 4:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But Moses said to the people, &quot;Do not fear! Stand by
and see the salvation of the LORD which He will accomplish for you today; for
the Egyptians whom you have seen today, you will never see them again forever.
&quot;The LORD will fight for you while you keep silent.&quot;&quot;  (Exodus
14:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;In peace I will both lie down and sleep, For You alone, O
LORD, make me to dwell in safety.&quot;  (Psalms 4:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When I am afraid, I will put my trust in You.&quot; 
(Psalms 56:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Yet those who wait for the LORD Will gain new strength;
They will mount up with wings like eagles, They will run and not get tired,
They will walk and not become weary.&quot;  (Isaiah 40:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;The steadfast of mind You will keep in perfect
peace, Because he trusts in You.&quot;  (Isaiah 26:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;'Do not fear, for I am with you; Do not anxiously look
about you, for I am your God. I will strengthen you, surely I will help you,
Surely I will uphold you with My righteous right hand.'&quot;  (Isaiah 41:10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us,
who is against us?&quot;  (Romans 8:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him over
for us all, how will He not also with Him freely give us all things?&quot; 
(Romans 8:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some count
slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing for any to perish but for all
to come to repentance.” (2 Peter 3:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses
surrounding us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so
easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before
us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the
joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at
the right hand of the throne of God.” (Hebrews 12:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT
HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.” (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and I give eternal life to them, and they will never perish;
and no one will snatch them out of My hand.” (John 10:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than
all; and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand.” (John 10:29,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I and the Father are one.&quot;” (John 10:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For I am confident of this very thing, that He who began a
good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus.” (Philippians
1:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it
yet; but one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to
what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of
God in Christ Jesus.” (Philippians 3:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and
supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the
peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, will guard your hearts and
your minds in Christ Jesus.” (Philippians 4:6-7, NASB)</p>
