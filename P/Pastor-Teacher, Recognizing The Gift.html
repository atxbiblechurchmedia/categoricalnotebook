<h2><a name="_The_Pastor-Teacher_Recognizing"></a>Pastor-Teacher, Recognizing The
Gift</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher should first understand very well the
grace apparatus for perception as the only grace mechanism for learning and
applying Bible doctrine. He should be very familiar with the passages on
spiritual gifts and that there are only two major communication gifts of
evangelism and pastor-teacher for the Church Age. Eph. 4:11; Rom. 12:3-8; 1
Cor. 3:12-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and
some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers,&quot;  (Ephesians 4:11,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For through the grace given to me I say to everyone among
you not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think; but to think so
as to have sound judgment, as God has allotted to each a measure of faith. For
just as we have many members in one body and all the members do not have the
same function, so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually
members one of another. Since we have gifts that differ according to the grace
given to us, each of us is to exercise them accordingly: if prophecy, according
to the proportion of his faith; if service, in his serving; or he who teaches,
in his teaching; or he who exhorts, in his exhortation; he who gives, with
liberality; he who leads, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with
cheerfulness.&quot;  (Romans 12:3-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold,
silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, each man's work will become evident;
for the day will show it because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire
itself will test the quality of each man's work. If any man's work which he has
built on it remains, he will receive a reward.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 3:12-14,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher should also know well the other
permanent spiritual gifts such as administration, service, helps, giving and so
on. He should understand why some spiritual gifts are permanent and some were
temporary and ceased to function long ago. Isaiah 28:10; Isaiah 28:13; 1 Cor.
14:21-22; 1 Cor. 13:8. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;For He says, 'Order on order, order on order, Line
on line, line on line, A little here, a little there.'&quot;&quot;  (Isaiah
28:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So the word of the LORD to them will be, &quot;Order on
order, order on order, Line on line, line on line, A little here, a little
there,&quot; That they may go and stumble backward, be broken, snared and taken
captive.&quot;  (Isaiah 28:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;In the Law it is written, &quot;BY MEN OF STRANGE TONGUES
AND BY THE LIPS OF STRANGERS I WILL SPEAK TO THIS PEOPLE, AND EVEN SO THEY WILL
NOT LISTEN TO ME,&quot; says the Lord. So then tongues are for a sign, not to
those who believe but to unbelievers; but prophecy is for a sign, not to
unbelievers but to those who believe.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 14:21-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Love never fails; but if there are gifts of prophecy,
they will be done away; if there are tongues, they will cease; if there is
knowledge, it will be done away.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 13:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher should have an unusual interest in the
Word of God. He should want to understand it and want to stick with learning
it. He should have more than an inkling that he has the gift of pastor-teacher.
When he tries to reject the thought, it keeps returning. 2 Tim. 3:14-17;  1
Cor. 9:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;You, however, continue in the things you have learned and
become convinced of, knowing from whom you have learned them, and that from
childhood you have known the sacred writings which are able to give you the
wisdom that leads to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. All
Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for
correction, for training in righteousness; so that the man of God may be
adequate, equipped for every good work.&quot;  (2 Timothy 3:14-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to boast of,
for I am under compulsion; for woe is me if I do not preach the gospel.&quot; 
(1 Corinthians 9:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Pressure is definitely needed leading into the
development of the spiritual gift. In 1 Timothy 1:12, “strengthened” is the
aorist active participle of <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>νδυναμο</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (endunamoō) and means to be strong, endue with strength, to
receive strength, be strengthened, increase in strength. “Considered” is the
aorist active indicative of <span lang=EL>η</span>̔<span lang=EL>γε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ομαι</span> (hēgeomai) and means to consider, to deem, to account, to think.
“Putting” is the aorist middle participle <span lang=EL>τι</span>́<span
lang=EL>θημι</span> (tithēmi) and means to set, to put, to place. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has strengthened me,
because He considered me faithful, putting me into service,&quot;  (1 Timothy
1:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Timothy 2:7, “appointed” is the aorist passive
indicative of <span lang=EL>τι</span>́<span lang=EL>θημι</span> (tithēmi). He
should definitely have a desire to be a pastor-teacher. This is a burning
desire to communicate Bible doctrine accurately.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For this I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I am
telling the truth, I am not lying) as a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and
truth.&quot;  (1 Timothy 2:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Timothy 3:1, “aspires” is the present middle
indicative of <span lang=EL>ο</span>̓<span lang=EL>ρε</span>́<span lang=EL>γομαι</span>
(oregomai). The emphasis here is on the pastorate meaning to reach, to stretch
out, a mental effort of longing after being a pastor-teacher. He does this
because he has the gift of pastor-teacher. “Desires” is the present active
indicative of <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>πιθυμε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(epithumeō) with emphasis on the impulse.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;It is a trustworthy statement: if any man aspires to the
office of overseer, it is a fine work he desires to do.&quot;  (1 Timothy 3:1,
NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Timothy 4:14, “Do not neglect” is the present active
imperative of <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>μελε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(ameleo) and means careless. How to be careless? By not staying in fellowship.
By not functioning under the grace apparatus for perception. By not applying
Bible doctrine to your life’s situations and pressures. Instead going under
emotional revolt of the soul or reversionism. You are definitely warned to not
be “careless” about the gift, if you have it. Don’t play around. Face it
squarely!</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Do not neglect the spiritual gift within you, which was
bestowed on you through prophetic utterance with the laying on of hands by the
presbytery.&quot;  (1 Timothy 4:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One with the gift is definitely commanded to “pay close
attention” or <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>πε</span>́<span lang=EL>χω</span>
(epechō) in 1 Timothy 4:16 and 2 Timothy 1:13-14. “To persevere” is the
present active imperative of <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>πιμε</span>́<span
lang=EL>νω</span> (epimenō) and means to stay upon, to remain unmoved, to
continue, to persist, to persevere. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Pay close attention to yourself and to your teaching;
persevere in these things, for as you do this you will ensure salvation both
for yourself and for those who hear you.&quot;  (1 Timothy 4:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Retain the standard of sound words which you have heard
from me, in the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus. Guard, through the
Holy Spirit who dwells in us, the treasure which has been entrusted to
you.&quot;  (2 Timothy 1:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher are definitely exhorted to “kindle
afresh” the gift of God in 2 Timothy 1:6 with the present active infinitive of <span
lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>ναζωπυρε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(anazōpureō) from <span lang=EL>ανα</span> (up, or again) + <span lang=EL>ζωη</span>
(life) + <span lang=EL>πυρ</span> (fire) meaning to keep on kindling afresh, to
keep in full flame. Here, the gift of God is regarded as a fire capable of
dying out through neglect. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For this reason I remind you to kindle afresh the gift of
God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.&quot;  (2 Timothy 1:6,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Gift” is not <span lang=EL>δωρον</span> (doron), but <span
lang=EL>χα</span>́<span lang=EL>ρισμα</span> (charisma). This is a “gift of
grace,” a gift involving grace on the part of God as a donor. It is also used
in the following verses. Rom. 12:6; 1 Cor. 1:7; 1 Cor. 12:4; 1 Cor. 12:9; 1
Cor. 12:28; 1 Cor. 12:30-31; 1 Tim. 4:14; 1 Peter 4:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Since we have gifts that differ according to the grace
given to us, each of us is to exercise them accordingly: if prophecy, according
to the proportion of his faith;&quot;  (Romans 12:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;As each one has received a special gift, employ it in
serving one another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.&quot;  (1
Peter 4:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One with the spiritual gift of pastor-teacher is
definitely commanded to endure hardship as a good soldier. In 2 Timothy 2:3,
“Suffer hardship” is the aorist active imperative of <span lang=EL>συγκακοπαθε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (sugkakopatheō) and means to suffer together with someone, to
suffer hardship. 2 Tim. 2:10; 2 Tim. 3:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Suffer hardship with me, as a good soldier of Christ
Jesus.&quot;  (2 Timothy 2:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason I endure all things for the sake of those who
are chosen, so that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus
and with it eternal glory.” (2 Timothy 2:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“You, however, continue in the things you have learned and
become convinced of, knowing from whom you have learned them,” (2 Timothy 3:14,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher should stay out of the details of
life. The pastor-teacher gift is a non-detail gift! He should strive lawfully. The
pastor-teacher should ask himself if he can take the guff. He is definitely
commanded to be diligent in his preparation to study. All are mandates in the aorist
active imperative. 2 Tim. 2:4; 2 Tim. 2:5; 2 Tim. 2:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;No soldier in active service entangles himself in the
affairs of everyday life, so that he may please the one who enlisted him as a
soldier.&quot;  (2 Timothy 2:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Also if anyone competes as an athlete, he does not win
the prize unless he competes according to the rules.&quot;  (2 Timothy 2:5,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a
workman who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of
truth.&quot;  (2 Timothy 2:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher is to avoid worldly and empty chatter.
In 2 Timothy 2:16, “worldly” is <span lang=EL>βε</span>́<span lang=EL>βηλος</span>
(bebēlos) and means profane, worldly and “empty chatter” is <span lang=EL>κενοφωνι</span>́<span
lang=EL>α</span> (kenophōnia) from <span lang=EL>κενός</span> (empty) and <span
lang=EL>φωνή</span> (a sound) and signifies empty discussion, discussion on
useless subjects. Also “worldly fables” in 1 Timothy 4:7 and  “idle babbler” in
Acts 17:18, <span lang=EL>σπερμολο</span>́<span lang=EL>γος</span>
(spermologos) meaning to collect a seed, a seed picker, an empty talker, a babbler. 
In 1 Timothy 6:20, “avoiding” is the present active participle from <span
lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>κτρε</span>́<span lang=EL>πω</span> (ektrepō)
meaning to turn away from vain babblings.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But avoid worldly and empty chatter, for it will lead to
further ungodliness,&quot;  (2 Timothy 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But have nothing to do with worldly fables fit only for
old women. On the other hand, discipline yourself for the purpose of
godliness;&quot;  (1 Timothy 4:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And also some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers
were conversing with him. Some were saying, &quot;What would this idle babbler
wish to say?&quot; Others, &quot;He seems to be a proclaimer of strange
deities,&quot;—because he was preaching Jesus and the resurrection.&quot; 
(Acts 17:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;O Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you, avoiding
worldly and empty chatter and the opposing arguments of what is falsely called
&quot;knowledge&quot;—&quot;  (1 Timothy 6:20, NASB)</p>
