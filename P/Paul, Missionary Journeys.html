<h2><a name="_D-Paul,_Missionary_Journeys"></a><a
name="_Paul,_Missionary_Journeys"></a>Paul, Missionary Journeys</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>First Missionary Journey</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All three journeys began in Antioch in Syria. Barnabas
and Paul were sent out. Their first destination was the island of Cyprus. Acts
13:1-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now there were at Antioch, in the church that was there,
prophets and teachers: Barnabas, and Simeon who was called Niger, and Lucius of
Cyrene, and Manaen who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
While they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said,
&quot;Set apart for Me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called
them.&quot; Then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them,
they sent them away.&quot;  (Acts 13:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Then to Seleucia. Acts 13:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to
Seleucia and from there they sailed to Cyprus.&quot;  (Acts 13:4, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Then to Salamis. Acts 13:5. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When they reached Salamis, they began to proclaim the
word of God in the synagogues of the Jews; and they also had John as their
helper.&quot;  (Acts 13:5, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Then to Paphos. Here Sergius Paulus was converted. Note
the name change from Saul to Paul. Acts 13:6-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When they had gone through the whole island as far as
Paphos, they found a magician, a Jewish false prophet whose name was Bar-Jesus,
who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of intelligence. This man
summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God. But Elymas the
magician (for so his name is translated) was opposing them, seeking to turn the
proconsul away from the faith. But Saul, who was also known as Paul, filled
with the Holy Spirit, fixed his gaze on him, and said, &quot;You who are full
of all deceit and fraud, you son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness,
will you not cease to make crooked the straight ways of the Lord? &quot;Now,
behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will be blind and not see the
sun for a time.&quot; And immediately a mist and a darkness fell upon him, and
he went about seeking those who would lead him by the hand. Then the proconsul
believed when he saw what had happened, being amazed at the teaching of the
Lord.&quot;  (Acts 13:6-12, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Then to Perga in Pamphylia. The young man, John Mark, became
fearful and returned to Jerusalem. Acts 13:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now Paul and his companions put out to sea from Paphos
and came to Perga in Pamphylia; but John left them and returned to
Jerusalem.&quot;  (Acts 13:13, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul went to Pisidian Antioch and preached a great sermon
there. He was in South Galatia (also Iconium, Lystra, Derbe). Acts 13:14-52.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But going on from Perga, they arrived at Pisidian
Antioch, and on the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat
down.&quot;  (Acts 13:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;As Paul and Barnabas were going out, the people kept
begging that these things might be spoken to them the next Sabbath.&quot; 
(Acts 13:42, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The next Sabbath nearly the whole city assembled to hear
the word of the Lord. But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with
jealousy and began contradicting the things spoken by Paul, and were
blaspheming.&quot;  (Acts 13:44-45, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But the Jews incited the devout women of prominence and
the leading men of the city, and instigated a persecution against Paul and
Barnabas, and drove them out of their district. But they shook off the dust of
their feet in protest against them and went to Iconium.&quot;  (Acts 13:50-51,
NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul then went to Iconium where there was persecution of
unsaved Jews. Acts 14:1-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;In Iconium they entered the synagogue of the Jews
together, and spoke in such a manner that a large number of people believed,
both of Jews and of Greeks. But the Jews who disbelieved stirred up the minds
of the Gentiles and embittered them against the brethren. Therefore they spent
a long time there speaking boldly with reliance upon the Lord, who was
testifying to the word of His grace, granting that signs and wonders be done by
their hands. But the people of the city were divided; and some sided with the
Jews, and some with the apostles. And when an attempt was made by both the
Gentiles and the Jews with their rulers, to mistreat and to stone them,&quot; 
(Acts 14:1-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At Lystra, a lame man was healed. Paul was also stoned
here. Acts 14:6-19.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;they became aware of it and fled to the cities of
Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the surrounding region; and there they
continued to preach the gospel.&quot;  (Acts 14:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;At Lystra a man was sitting who had no strength in his
feet, lame from his mother's womb, who had never walked. This man was listening
to Paul as he spoke, who, when he had fixed his gaze on him and had seen that
he had faith to be made well, said with a loud voice, &quot;Stand upright on
your feet.&quot; And he leaped up and began to walk.&quot;  (Acts 14:8-10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and having won
over the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing
him to be dead.&quot;  (Acts 14:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Then on to Derbe. Acts 14:20. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But while the disciples stood around him, he got up and
entered the city. The next day he went away with Barnabas to Derbe.&quot; 
(Acts 14:20, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They returned to Lystra, Iconium, then to Antioch in
Pisidia, then to Perga in Pamphylia, Attalia, and then sailed back to Antioch
in Syria. Acts 14:21-28.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;After they had preached the gospel to that city and had
made many disciples, they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch,
strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the
faith, and saying, &quot;Through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of
God.&quot;&quot;  (Acts 14:21-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;They passed through Pisidia and came into Pamphylia. When
they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia. From there they
sailed to Antioch, from which they had been commended to the grace of God for
the work that they had accomplished.&quot;  (Acts 14:24-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>No books were written on Paul’s first missionary journey
unless the Southern Galatian theory is taken. Then, he would have written
Galatians. Otherwise, Galatians was written on the third missionary journey.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Second Missionary Journey</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This missionary journey began in Antioch which had by
this time replaced Jerusalem as the missionary center. Here, Paul had a big
disagreement with Barnabas. Paul didn’t want to take John Mark because of his
giving up in Perga on the last journey. Barnabas was right and Paul was wrong. John
Mark developed beautifully. So, Paul went with Silas and Barnabas went with John
Mark. Acts 15:35-40. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch, teaching and
preaching with many others also, the word of the Lord. After some days Paul
said to Barnabas, &quot;Let us return and visit the brethren in every city in
which we proclaimed the word of the Lord, and see how they are.&quot; Barnabas
wanted to take John, called Mark, along with them also. But Paul kept insisting
that they should not take him along who had deserted them in Pamphylia and had
not gone with them to the work. And there occurred such a sharp disagreement
that they separated from one another, and Barnabas took Mark with him and
sailed away to Cyprus. But Paul chose Silas and left, being committed by the
brethren to the grace of the Lord.&quot;  (Acts 15:35-40, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul and Silas went to Derbe and Lystra which were
visited on the previous journey. Young Timothy joined the party at Lystra. Acts
16:1-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Paul came also to Derbe and to Lystra. And a disciple was
there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, but his
father was a Greek, and he was well spoken of by the brethren who were in
Lystra and Iconium. Paul wanted this man to go with him; and he took him and
circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those parts, for they all knew
that his father was a Greek. Now while they were passing through the cities,
they were delivering the decrees which had been decided upon by the apostles
and elders who were in Jerusalem, for them to observe. So the churches were
being strengthened in the faith, and were increasing in number daily.&quot; 
(Acts 16:1-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They then went through Phrygia and Galatia. Paul was
forbidden to preach in Asia Minor, so he went on to Mysia. Paul was forbidden
to minister in Bithynia, so he went on to Troas. Here, Paul received the
Macedonian vision, “Come over to Macedonia and help us!” So they did via
Samothrace. They then went on to Neapolis and finally arriving at Philippi. Acts
16:6-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;They passed through the Phrygian and Galatian region,
having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia; and after
they came to Mysia, they were trying to go into Bithynia, and the Spirit of
Jesus did not permit them; and passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas. A
vision appeared to Paul in the night: a man of Macedonia was standing and
appealing to him, and saying, &quot;Come over to Macedonia and help us.&quot;
When he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go into Macedonia,
concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them. So putting out
to sea from Troas, we ran a straight course to Samothrace, and on the day
following to Neapolis;&quot;  (Acts 16:6-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first convert in Macedonia was Lydia, a business
woman. A demon was cast out of a young girl. They were put in prison and this
resulted in miraculous delivery and the jailer and his house being saved. Acts
16:12-40. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;A woman named Lydia, from the city of Thyatira, a seller
of purple fabrics, a worshiper of God, was listening; and the Lord opened her
heart to respond to the things spoken by Paul. And when she and her household
had been baptized, she urged us, saying, &quot;If you have judged me to be
faithful to the Lord, come into my house and stay.&quot; And she prevailed upon
us.&quot;  (Acts 16:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;She continued doing this for many days. But Paul was
greatly annoyed, and turned and said to the spirit, &quot;I command you in the
name of Jesus Christ to come out of her!&quot; And it came out at that very
moment.&quot;  (Acts 16:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The crowd rose up together against them, and the chief
magistrates tore their robes off them and proceeded to order them to be beaten
with rods. When they had struck them with many blows, they threw them into
prison, commanding the jailer to guard them securely; and he, having received
such a command, threw them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the
stocks.&quot;  (Acts 16:22-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and after he brought them out, he said, &quot;Sirs, what
must I do to be saved?&quot; They said, &quot;Believe in the Lord Jesus, and
you will be saved, you and your household.&quot; And they spoke the word of the
Lord to him together with all who were in his house.&quot;  (Acts 16:30-32,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They then went on to Thessalonica. They were there about
three weeks and much doctrine was taught. Acts 17:1-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now when they had traveled through Amphipolis and
Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.
And according to Paul's custom, he went to them, and for three Sabbaths
reasoned with them from the Scriptures,&quot;  (Acts 17:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But the Jews, becoming jealous and taking along some
wicked men from the market place, formed a mob and set the city in an uproar;
and attacking the house of Jason, they were seeking to bring them out to the
people.&quot;  (Acts 17:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Then on to Berea searching for students of the Word. Acts
17:10-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The brethren immediately sent Paul and Silas away by
night to Berea, and when they arrived, they went into the synagogue of the
Jews. Now these were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica, for they
received the word with great eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see
whether these things were so. Therefore many of them believed, along with a
number of prominent Greek women and men. But when the Jews of Thessalonica
found out that the word of God had been proclaimed by Paul in Berea also, they
came there as well, agitating and stirring up the crowds. Then immediately the
brethren sent Paul out to go as far as the sea; and Silas and Timothy remained
there.&quot;  (Acts 17:10-14, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Athens, Paul preached his famous sermon on Mar’s Hill.
Many orators and philosophers were heard here. This was something like Hyde
Park in London or Bughouse Square (<span style='font-size:10.5pt;font-family:
"Georgia",serif;background:white'>Washington Square Park)</span> in Chicago. Acts
17:15-34.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit
was being provoked within him as he was observing the city full of idols. So he
was reasoning in the synagogue with the Jews and the God-fearing Gentiles, and
in the market place every day with those who happened to be present.&quot; 
(Acts 17:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Being then the children of God, we ought not to
think that the Divine Nature is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed
by the art and thought of man. &quot;Therefore having overlooked the times of
ignorance, God is now declaring to men that all people everywhere should
repent, because He has fixed a day in which He will judge the world in
righteousness through a Man whom He has appointed, having furnished proof to
all men by raising Him from the dead.&quot;&quot;  (Acts 17:29-31, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Corinth, Paul wrote 1 and 2 Thessalonians. He also
made tents to support himself there. Priscilla and Aquila were there. A big
fish was caught when Crispus the chief ruler of the synagogue was converted.
Paul also faced the calm Gallio. Acts 18:1-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;After these things he left Athens and went to Corinth.
And he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, having recently come from
Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to
leave Rome. He came to them, and because he was of the same trade, he stayed
with them and they were working, for by trade they were tent-makers.&quot; 
(Acts 18:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul
began devoting himself completely to the word, solemnly testifying to the Jews
that Jesus was the Christ. But when they resisted and blasphemed, he shook out
his garments and said to them, &quot;Your blood be on your own heads! I am
clean. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.&quot;&quot;  (Acts 18:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Crispus, the leader of the synagogue, believed in the
Lord with all his household, and many of the Corinthians when they heard were
believing and being baptized. And the Lord said to Paul in the night by a
vision, &quot;Do not be afraid any longer, but go on speaking and do not be
silent; for I am with you, and no man will attack you in order to harm you, for
I have many people in this city.&quot; &quot;  (Acts 18:8-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to
the Jews, &quot;If it were a matter of wrong or of vicious crime, O Jews, it
would be reasonable for me to put up with you; but if there are questions about
words and names and your own law, look after it yourselves; I am unwilling to
be a judge of these matters.&quot;&quot;  (Acts 18:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul then went back to Ephesus and finally to Antioch. Acts
18:18-22.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Paul, having remained many days longer, took leave of the
brethren and put out to sea for Syria, and with him were Priscilla and Aquila.
In Cenchrea he had his hair cut, for he was keeping a vow. They came to
Ephesus, and he left them there. Now he himself entered the synagogue and
reasoned with the Jews. When they asked him to stay for a longer time, he did
not consent, but taking leave of them and saying, &quot;I will return to you
again if God wills,&quot; he set sail from Ephesus. When he had landed at
Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church, and went down to Antioch.&quot; 
(Acts 18:18-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This was the end of Second Missionary Journey. In the
meantime, Aquila and Priscilla ran into the mighty preacher Apollos and took
him aside for personal counsel and help. Acts 18:24-28.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now a Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, an
eloquent man, came to Ephesus; and he was mighty in the Scriptures. This man
had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he was
speaking and teaching accurately the things concerning Jesus, being acquainted
only with the baptism of John; and he began to speak out boldly in the
synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and
explained to him the way of God more accurately. And when he wanted to go across
to Achaia, the brethren encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome
him; and when he had arrived, he greatly helped those who had believed through
grace, for he powerfully refuted the Jews in public, demonstrating by the
Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.&quot;  (Acts 18:24-28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Third Missionary Journey</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul left Antioch and travelled to Galatia and Phrygia. Acts
18:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And having spent some time there, he left and passed
successively through the Galatian region and Phrygia, strengthening all the
disciples.&quot;  (Acts 18:23, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He then went to Ephesus. He spent the bulk of his time
there, three years in all. Here was the uproar of the silversmiths. 1 and 2
Corinthians were written here. Acts 19:1-41.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Paul said, &quot;John baptized with the baptism of
repentance, telling the people to believe in Him who was coming after him, that
is, in Jesus.&quot; When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the
Lord Jesus.&quot;  (Acts 19:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;This took place for two years, so that all who lived in
Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.&quot;  (Acts 19:10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;God was performing extraordinary miracles by the hands of
Paul, so that handkerchiefs or aprons were even carried from his body to the
sick, and the diseases left them and the evil spirits went out.&quot;  (Acts
19:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So the word of the Lord was growing mightily and
prevailing.&quot;  (Acts 19:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For a man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver
shrines of Artemis, was bringing no little business to the craftsmen; these he
gathered together with the workmen of similar trades, and said, &quot;Men, you
know that our prosperity depends upon this business. &quot;You see and hear
that not only in Ephesus, but in almost all of Asia, this Paul has persuaded
and turned away a considerable number of people, saying that gods made with
hands are no gods at all. &quot;Not only is there danger that this trade of
ours fall into disrepute, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis
be regarded as worthless and that she whom all of Asia and the world worship
will even be dethroned from her magnificence.&quot; When they heard this and
were filled with rage, they began crying out, saying, &quot;Great is Artemis of
the Ephesians!&quot;&quot;  (Acts 19:24-28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul then went on to Macedonia (Greece). Romans was
written here. Acts 20:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;After the uproar had ceased, Paul sent for the disciples,
and when he had exhorted them and taken his leave of them, he left to go to
Macedonia. When he had gone through those districts and had given them much
exhortation, he came to Greece.&quot;  (Acts 20:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul was accompanied by other pastors at Philippi. Acts
20:3-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And there he spent three months, and when a plot was
formed against him by the Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he
decided to return through Macedonia. And he was accompanied by Sopater of
Berea, the son of Pyrrhus, and by Aristarchus and Secundus of the
Thessalonians, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus of
Asia. But these had gone on ahead and were waiting for us at Troas. We sailed
from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread, and came to them at Troas
within five days; and there we stayed seven days.&quot;  (Acts 20:3-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At Troas, he had an all-night service. A boy fell out of
the window and died, but was raised to life by Paul. All in a night’s work. Acts
20:6-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And there was a young man named Eutychus sitting on the
window sill, sinking into a deep sleep; and as Paul kept on talking, he was
overcome by sleep and fell down from the third floor and was picked up dead.
But Paul went down and fell upon him, and after embracing him, he said,
&quot;Do not be troubled, for his life is in him.&quot; When he had gone back
up and had broken the bread and eaten, he talked with them a long while until
daybreak, and then left. They took away the boy alive, and were greatly
comforted.&quot;  (Acts 20:9-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At Miletus, Paul said farewell to the Ephesian pastors. Acts
20:13-38.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;And now, behold, bound by the Spirit, I am on my
way to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there, except that the
Holy Spirit solemnly testifies to me in every city, saying that bonds and
afflictions await me.&quot;  (Acts 20:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock,
among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of
God which He purchased with His own blood. &quot;I know that after my departure
savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock; and from among
your own selves men will arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away the
disciples after them.&quot;  (Acts 20:28-30, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;In everything I showed you that by working hard in
this manner you must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus,
that He Himself said, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.' &quot; When
he had said these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all. And they
began to weep aloud and embraced Paul, and repeatedly kissed him,&quot;  (Acts
20:35-37, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He then went on to Tyre and Caesarea. Here, Paul was
warned by Agabus not to go to Jerusalem. Acts 21:1-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;After looking up the disciples, we stayed there seven
days; and they kept telling Paul through the Spirit not to set foot in
Jerusalem.&quot;  (Acts 21:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;As we were staying there for some days, a prophet named
Agabus came down from Judea. And coming to us, he took Paul's belt and bound
his own feet and hands, and said, &quot;This is what the Holy Spirit says: 'In
this way the Jews at Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and deliver
him into the hands of the Gentiles.'&quot; When we had heard this, we as well
as the local residents began begging him not to go up to Jerusalem. Then Paul
answered, &quot;What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready
not only to be bound, but even to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord
Jesus.&quot; And since he would not be persuaded, we fell silent, remarking,
&quot;The will of the Lord be done!&quot;&quot;  (Acts 21:10-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Fourth Missionary Journey</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Upon his acquittal in 63-64 AD, Paul was released from
the Roman prison after several years and was free for four or five years to
minister. He traveled east to Asia Minor by way of Macedonia. Apparently he
again retraced his steps getting as far West as Spain. In 67-68 AD, he was
again imprisoned. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>During his first Roman imprisonment, he wrote Ephesians,
Philippians, Colossians and Philemon. During his second imprisonment, he wrote
the letters of 1 &amp; 2 Timothy and Titus to pastors to encourage them, namely
Timothy and Titus, who were ministering in Ephesus and Crete.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When Paul wrote to the Roman church in 58 AD, it was a
vigorous church. But four years later they had lost their vigor. They could not
send Paul west. He had to go back to the churches which could still send out
missionaries. Sometimes you have to go backward in order to go forward. You
have to be disciplined before you can advance. Phil. 2:24; Philemon 1:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and I trust in the Lord that I myself also will be coming
shortly.&quot;  (Philippians 2:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;At the same time also prepare me a lodging, for I hope
that through your prayers I will be given to you.&quot;  (Philemon 1:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This meant that Paul traveled by land. Paul went to
Colossi, to which he had never been. He also went to Philippi and Ephesus. Paul
had not previously visited the Lycus valley, but felt it necessary to do so
because he had never seen what the indigenous movement could do totally without
his influence. Also, Gnosticism was there.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>During 64 AD, towards the end of the year, he traveled
west to Spain. Paul embarked from Ephesus to Marseille, France. He didn't stop
at Rome because Nero had burned Rome and blamed the Christians. Paul had heard
that Nero was hunting for him. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>From Marseille where Paul established a mission station,
he crossed to Cadis, Spain and served two years in Spain, 64-66 AD. From Spain
he returned to Ephesus where he had left Timothy. Rom. 15:24; Rom. 15:28.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;whenever I go to Spain—for I hope to see you in passing,
and to be helped on my way there by you, when I have first enjoyed your company
for a while—&quot;  (Romans 15:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore, when I have finished this, and have put my
seal on this fruit of theirs, I will go on by way of you to Spain.&quot; 
(Romans 15:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He then went to Macedonia and wrote back to Timothy in 1
Timothy. At this time, Paul also wrote to Titus in Crete. Trouble broke out all
over the empire, so Paul started leaving people at the hot spots. Trophemus was
left at Miletus and Erastus was left at Corinth. Paul then went to Nicopolis of
Epirus which is a province on the western coast of Greece and spent the winter
there in 67-68 AD. Titus 3:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, make every effort
to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter
there.&quot;  (Titus 3:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In chains, he was brought to Rome and wrote his last
letter to Timothy in June 68 AD. A few days later he was killed. Except for
Luke, Paul was alone at this time. Paul knew he was condemned before the trial.
He knew he would die painlessly under dying grace. 2 Tim. 2:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;for which I suffer hardship even to imprisonment as a
criminal; but the word of God is not imprisoned.&quot;  (2 Timothy 2:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Pauline team of missionaries had been dispersed. Timothy
was at Ephesus. Titus was at Crete. 1 Tim. 1:3; Titus 1:4-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;As I urged you upon my departure for Macedonia, remain on
at Ephesus so that you may instruct certain men not to teach strange
doctrines,&quot;  (1 Timothy 1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;To Titus, my true child in a common faith: Grace and
peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior. For this reason I left
you in Crete, that you would set in order what remains and appoint elders in
every city as I directed you,&quot;  (Titus 1:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Trophimus was at Miletus. Erastus was at Corinth. 2 Tim.
4:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Erastus remained at Corinth, but Trophimus I left sick at
Miletus.&quot;  (2 Timothy 4:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Crescens was in Galatia. Titus (not the same as above)
was in Dalmatia. This was another Titus, not the Titus in Crete. 2 Tim. 4:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;for Demas, having loved this present world, has deserted
me and gone to Thessalonica; Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to
Dalmatia.&quot;  (2 Timothy 4:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Tychicus was in Ephesus. 2 Tim. 4:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.&quot;  (2 Timothy
4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A brief account of Paul's trial is given in 2 Timothy
4:6-8 and 2 Timothy 4:14-17. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For I am already being poured out as a drink offering,
and the time of my departure has come. I have fought the good fight, I have
finished the course, I have kept the faith; in the future there is laid up for
me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award
to me on that day; and not only to me, but also to all who have loved His
appearing.&quot;  (2 Timothy 4:6-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm; the Lord will
repay him according to his deeds. Be on guard against him yourself, for he
vigorously opposed our teaching. At my first defense no one supported me, but
all deserted me; may it not be counted against them. But the Lord stood with me
and strengthened me, so that through me the proclamation might be fully
accomplished, and that all the Gentiles might hear; and I was rescued out of
the lion's mouth.&quot;  (2 Timothy 4:14-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Between his trial and execution, Paul wrote 2 Timothy.
Peter and Paul were both put to death by Nero the Roman Emperor, probably
within several months of each other. A few days later, Nero was assassinated
for this by the Praetorian guard, thus ending the Claudio-Julian line.</p>
