<h2>Peace</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Peace is a technical word for man’s response to God’s grace.
Peace is not a feeling. It’s a mental attitude based on a relationship. The Bible
uses peace in two ways - peace <u>with</u> God at salvation and the peace <u>of</u>
God in the Christian way of life. There is no mental peace for the wicked. Isaiah
48:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;There is no peace for the wicked,&quot; says the LORD.”
(Isaiah 48:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Where you find peace in the Bible, it refers to reconciliation
at the point of salvation or living the spiritual life with a mental attitude
found in the believer. Eph. 2:14; 2 Tim. 1:7. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For He Himself is our peace, who made both groups into one and
broke down the barrier of the dividing wall,” (Ephesians 2:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of power
and love and discipline.” (2 Timothy 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Salvation: Peace With God </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Peace can never come to you apart from God's grace. The Cross
is the source of grace and consequently the source of peace. At salvation, He
is our eternal peace. Grace removed the barrier, making peace between man and
God. When the unbeliever responds by faith to grace, the result is peace. Rom.
5:1; Eph. 2:14-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with
God through our Lord Jesus Christ,” (Romans 5:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ephesians 2:14, “our peace” refers to reconciliation
(removal of the barrier). In Ephesians 2:15, “abolishing” means once and for
all. “Enmity” refers to the barrier of sin between man and God. “In Himself”
refers to the humanity of Jesus Christ. “The Law of commandments” refers to the
 Mosaic-Law, Codex #1. “Ordinances” refers to the Mosaic Law, Codex #2. “That
in Himself He might make the two into one new man” refers to the believer’s union
with Christ that results from one of the salvation ministries of God the Holy
Spirit.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For He Himself is our peace, who made both groups into one and
broke down the barrier of the dividing wall,” (Ephesians 2:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“by abolishing in His flesh the enmity, which is the Law of
commandments contained in ordinances, so that in Himself He might make the two
into one new man, thus establishing peace,” (Ephesians 2:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ephesians 2:16, “both” refers to Jew and Gentile. “Having
put to death the enmity” refers to the work of Jesus Christ on the Cross that removed
the sin barrier between God and man.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the
cross, by it having put to death the enmity.” (Ephesians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ephesians 2:17, “you who were far away” refers to
Gentiles. “To those who were near” refers to the Jews. In Ephesians 2:18,  “our
access in one Spirit to the Father” refers to the Baptism of the Holy Spirit that
results in our permanent union with Christ at salvation. </p>

<p class=Verses>“AND HE CAME AND PREACHED PEACE TO YOU WHO WERE FAR AWAY, AND
PEACE TO THOSE WHO WERE NEAR;” (Ephesians 2:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“for through Him we both have our access in one Spirit to the
Father.” (Ephesians 2:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Christian Way of Life: Peace of God</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In our time on earth, we can have experiential peace.
When the believer responds by faith to the Word of God, the believer comes to
understand and use God's grace resources for living the spiritual life as He
intended resulting in a soul peace or inner happiness. Isaiah 26:3-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;The steadfast of mind You will keep in perfect peace,
Because he trusts in You. &quot;Trust in the LORD forever, For in GOD the LORD,
we have an everlasting Rock.” (Isaiah 26:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Soul peace can never come to you apart from God's grace. God's
grace is evident at non-meritorious faith belief in the work of Jesus Christ
for salvation. God's grace is evident when we confess sin biblically by simply
citing or naming them directly to God the Father in prayer using 1 John 1:9. We
are then restored to the filling of the Holy Spirit by God's grace which He
promised to all who claim the promise stated in that verse. The merit is all
with God. </p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Peace as well as grace is multiplied to the believer in their
spiritual life. Blessing comes from knowledge of Bible doctrine and
appropriation by using the enabling power of the Holy Spirit to live the
spiritual life.</p>
