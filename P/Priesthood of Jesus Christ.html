<h2>Priesthood of Jesus Christ </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our high priest, Jesus Christ was the One priest instead
of many that came before Him. His is an eternal service instead of limited
service. His is an unchangeable order instead of a changeable order. As Church
Age believer-priests, we are in union with Him and share all that He is. Heb.
7:23-24.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The former priests, on the one hand, existed in greater
numbers because they were prevented by death from continuing, but Jesus, on the
other hand, because He continues forever, holds His priesthood permanently.”
(Hebrews 7:23-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ brings eternal deliverance instead of
temporal deliverance. Our Lord has sovereign credentials instead of earthly
credentials. He is “holy, innocent, undefiled” instead of the Old Testament
priests who had to first offer sacrifices for their own sins, then for the sins
of the people. Heb. 7:25-26.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore He is able also to save forever those who draw near
to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them. For it
was fitting for us to have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled,
separated from sinners and exalted above the heavens;” (Hebrews 7:25-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is the One sacrificed for all instead of
many in the Old Testament. Heb. 7:27.</p>

<p class=Verses> “who does not need daily, like those high priests, to offer up
sacrifices, first for His own sins and then for the sins of the people, because
this He did once for all when He offered up Himself.” (Hebrews 7:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Aaronic priesthood was founded on the Mosaic Law. The
priesthood of Jesus Christ is based on the priesthood of Melchizedek and the
New Covenant. Jesus Christ, our high priest, is seated at the right hand of God
the Father in the place of highest honor in the heavenlies. Heb. 7:17; Heb.
8:l-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For it is attested of Him, &quot;YOU ARE A PRIEST FOREVER
ACCORDING TO THE ORDER OF MELCHIZEDEK.&quot;” (Hebrews 7:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now the main point in what has been said is this: we have such
a high priest, who has taken His seat at the right hand of the throne of the
Majesty in the heavens, a minister in the sanctuary and in the true tabernacle,
which the Lord pitched, not man.” (Hebrews 8:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The purpose of the high priest is described in Hebrews
8:2-5. He is a minister in the sanctuary, the holy place. Our Lord is a
minister of the true tabernacle, a dispenser of gifts, the giver of sacrifices,
and above all else because of His one sacrifice on the Cross for all mankind.
Heb. 10:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“a minister in the sanctuary and in the true tabernacle, which
the Lord pitched, not man. For every high priest is appointed to offer both
gifts and sacrifices; so it is necessary that this high priest also have
something to offer. Now if He were on earth, He would not be a priest at all,
since there are those who offer the gifts according to the Law; who serve a
copy and shadow of the heavenly things, just as Moses was warned by God when he
was about to erect the tabernacle; for, &quot;SEE,&quot; He says, &quot;THAT
YOU MAKE all things ACCORDING TO THE PATTERN WHICH WAS SHOWN YOU ON THE
MOUNTAIN.&quot;” (Hebrews 8:2-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“but He, having offered one sacrifice for sins for all time,
SAT DOWN AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD,” (Hebrews 10:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The quality of our Lord’s position as our high priest is
described in Hebrews 8:6. Our Lord Jesus Christ has a more excellent ministry
because it is based on better promises, His person, and His work on the Cross. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry, by as much
as He is also the mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted on
better promises.” (Hebrews 8:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The position of our high priest Jesus Christ is described
in Hebrews 10:12-13. He is seated at the right hand of God the Father as our
high priest and our advocate. He will remain there until the Rapture of the
Church.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but He, having offered one sacrifice for sins for all time,
SAT DOWN AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD, waiting from that time onward UNTIL HIS
ENEMIES BE MADE A FOOTSTOOL FOR HIS FEET.” (Hebrews 10:12-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Peter 2:6, we have the celebrityship of Jesus Christ
(parenthetical). “For this is contained” is the present active indicative of <span
lang=EL>περιε</span>́<span lang=EL>χω</span> (periechō) and means to encompass
or enclose. “I lay in Zion a choice stone, a precious corner stone” refers to
Jesus Christ, David’s son, a foundation stone that holds two corners together
of a building. The “precious corner stone” is positional and is the most
valuable stone.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“For this is contained in Scripture: &quot;BEHOLD, I LAY IN
ZION A CHOICE STONE, A PRECIOUS CORNER stone, AND HE WHO BELIEVES IN HIM WILL
NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.&quot;” (1 Peter 2:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A high priest is one who represents himself and others before
God. The high priest was always a man and ordained for men. Heb. 9:7; Heb. 5:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but into the second, only the high priest enters once a year,
not without taking blood, which he offers for himself and for the sins of the
people committed in ignorance.” (Hebrews 9:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For every high priest taken from among men is appointed on
behalf of men in things pertaining to God, in order to offer both gifts and
sacrifices for sins;” (Hebrews 5:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 3:1, “the Apostle” represents our Lord’s rank
and “High Priest” represents His work.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling,
consider Jesus, the Apostle and High Priest of our confession;” (Hebrews 3:1,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He was faithful to Him who appointed Him, as Moses also was in
all His house. For He has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by just
so much as the builder of the house has more honor than the house.” (Hebrews
3:2-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There were many priests in the Old Testament, but only
one high priest per tenure. Aaron was the first, then his eldest son and so on.
Moses was never a high priest, but he was the greatest grace man of the Old
Testament dispensation. Heb. 3:4-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all
things is God. Now Moses was faithful in all His house as a servant, for a
testimony of those things which were to be spoken later; but Christ was
faithful as a Son over His house—whose house we are, if we hold fast our
confidence and the boast of our hope firm until the end.” (Hebrews 3:4-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Because all Church Age believers were placed into union
with Jesus Christ by the Holy Spirit at salvation, we are royalty and priests
forever. Jesus Christ is our High-Priest. Heb. 5:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So also Christ did not glorify Himself so as to become a high
priest, but He who said to Him, &quot;YOU ARE MY SON, TODAY I HAVE BEGOTTEN
YOU&quot;;” (Hebrews 5:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We represent ourselves before God as royal priests.
Therefore, we are not to lean on others in the spiritual life or to be
counseled by others, but to lean on our own priesthood in the filling of the
Holy Spirit so we can grow spiritually and fulfill the plan of God for our
lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Uniqueness our High Priest</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is the only high priest to be both perfectly
sinless mankind and perfect eternal and undiminished deity in one person
forever. Therefore, His priesthood is both eternal and superior to all human
high priests of the Old Testament. Heb. 7:20-21; Heb. 7:24.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And inasmuch as it was not without an oath (for they indeed
became priests without an oath, but He with an oath through the One who said to
Him, &quot;THE LORD HAS SWORN AND WILL NOT CHANGE HIS MIND, 'YOU ARE A PRIEST
FOREVER'&quot;);” (Hebrews 7:20-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“but Jesus, on the other hand, because He continues forever,
holds His priesthood permanently.” (Hebrews 7:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is the only high priest to ever be qualified
to offer Himself as a sacrifice for sins of mankind. All other high priests
offered animal sacrifices pointing to the future Messiah who would offer
Himself for sin. Our Lord’s priestly sacrifice included redemption,
propitiation, and reconciliation. Heb. 9:26-27; Heb. 10:10; Heb. 10:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Otherwise, He would have needed to suffer often since the
foundation of the world; but now once at the consummation of the ages He has
been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself. And inasmuch as it
is appointed for men to die once and after this comes judgment,” (Hebrews
9:26-27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“By this will we have been sanctified through the offering of
the body of Jesus Christ once for all.” (Hebrews 10:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For by one offering He has perfected for all time those who
are sanctified.” (Hebrews 10:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ as our high priest was the first to have the
unique spiritual life of the Church Age that used the filling of the Holy
Spirit to empower His unique spiritual life. Our Lord was continually filling
of the Holy Spirit from birth. He remained sinless His entire life on earth and
thus became the perfect substitute for mankind on the Cross. In the
dispensation of the Church Age, all believers are royal priests because we are
in union with Jesus Christ forever.   </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is the only high-priest who provides eternal
life for those who believe in His atoning work on the Cross. John 3:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For God so loved the world, that He gave His only
begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal
life.” (John 3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is the first high priest and the only priest
to be resurrected. Our Lord functions as our high priest in His resurrection
body, seated at the right hand of God the Father in the third heaven. He makes
intercession for every believer as our High Priest. Heb 7:25.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore He is able also to save forever those who draw near
to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them.”
(Hebrews 7:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ as our High Priest is the minister of
spiritual things. Heb 5:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For every high priest taken from among men is appointed on
behalf of men in things pertaining to God, in order to offer both gifts and
sacrifices for sins;” (Hebrews 5:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ was appointed by God to a priesthood of a
higher order than the Levitical priesthood and according to the order of
Melchizedek. Heb. 5:5-6; Heb. 5:9-10; Heb. 7:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So also Christ did not glorify Himself so as to become a high
priest, but He who said to Him, &quot;YOU ARE MY SON, TODAY I HAVE BEGOTTEN
YOU&quot;; just as He says also in another passage, &quot;YOU ARE A PRIEST
FOREVER ACCORDING TO THE ORDER OF MELCHIZEDEK.&quot;” (Hebrews 5:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And having been made perfect, He became to all those who obey
Him the source of eternal salvation, being designated by God as a high priest
according to the order of Melchizedek.” (Hebrews 5:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High
God, who met Abraham as he was returning from the slaughter of the kings and
blessed him,” (Hebrews 7:1, NASB)</p>
