<h2>Pastor-Teacher, Functions</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The proper functions of the pastor-teacher are important
to the spiritual growth of the believers in a local church. In Philippians 1:1,
“saints” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̔́<span lang=EL>γιος</span> (hagios) and refers
to the believers in a local church. “Overseers” is <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span
lang=EL>πι</span>́<span lang=EL>σκοπος</span> (episkopos) and refers to pastor-teachers.
There are never two heads in a local church. There is no such thing as an
assistant pastor. “Deacons” is <span lang=EL>δια</span>́<span lang=EL>κονος</span>
(diakonos) and refers to the group of senior members of a local church who
conduct administration of the local church under the authority of the
pastor-teacher.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus, To all the
saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, including the overseers and
deacons:” (Philippians 1:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Warning to the Elders (Pastors) </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Peter 5:1, there were many (a plurality of) elders
or pastor-teachers. Why? All of the New Testament epistles were written to more
than one church such as Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia. These were
huge provinces and had many pastors in each province. 1 Peter 1:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, I exhort the elders among you, as your fellow elder
and witness of the sufferings of Christ, and a partaker also of the glory that
is to be revealed,” (1 Peter 5:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who reside as
aliens, scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
who are chosen” (1 Peter 1:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An elder or pastor was not a church officer like we have
today in the Presbyterian church. The Presbyterian form of government has a
plurality of elders and is a wrong system of church government. In 1 Peter 5:1,
“elders” is <span lang=EL>πρεσβυ</span>́<span lang=EL>τερος</span>
(presbuteros) and means an old man of senior rank. The <i>eteros</i> is a
comparative suffix which means “the most senior.” The stem <i>presbu</i> means “old
man” and denotes high rank. With the comparative suffix it means the old man,
the most senior.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There was one right elder for each assembly of believers.
It was a time of extreme persecution and it was important that the authority of
the pastor be recognized by all. The congregation must recognize the authority
of the pastor-teacher or elder. There should be no other elders or pastors around.
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Peter 5:1, “exhort” is the present active indicative
of <span lang=EL>παρακαλε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (parakaleō) and can
mean a chewing out or an encouragement. It has two almost antithetical
meanings. The meaning here is not a chewing out, but an encouragement. He wants
to encourage the pastors of the persecuted areas to intensify their efforts to
get out Bible doctrine on a daily basis.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Fellow elder” is <span lang=EL>συμπρεσβυ</span>́<span
lang=EL>τερος</span> (sumpresbuteros) and means along with or fellow elder.
Peter is speaking to them as their fellow elder. Notice that Peter does not
claim primacy or to be a Pope. He speaks as one pastor to another. There are
men today who have ministries among many pastors, but they are not apostles. Such
ministries only exist to the extent that other pastors recognize the authority
of that pastor as a means of encouragement and help to them. But he does not
superimpose his authority to their congregations. Peter was not hitting their
congregations, he was ministering to them. In times of apostacy there are
pastor’s pastors.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Peter 5:1, “witness” is <span lang=EL>μα</span>́<span
lang=EL>ρτυς</span> (martus) and is a judicial term. This has nothing to do
with witnessing to someone about Christ. Peter was a witness, a judicial
witness. He saw Jesus Christ suffer personally. That is the issue. Peter
evangelized in Acts 2, but not here. He was an observer and as such he was like
a legitimate witness in a courtroom.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Partaker also of the glory” is <span lang=EL>κοινωνο</span>́<span
lang=EL>ς</span><span lang=EL> </span>(koinōnos) and means a partner,
associate, comrade, companion, a sharer. Peter was a partner with reference to
eternity. Peter will share his eternal future with Christ. This includes Christ’s
glory. The extent that we share this is determined at the Judgment Seat of
Christ. We are all going to share in this glory from the standpoint of having
eternal life. The reason Peter brought this up is that the glories of eternity
cannot be compared with the sufferings of the present life. Suffering in time
is God’s opportunity to show His grace. 2 Cor. 4:16-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore we do not lose heart, but though our outer man is
decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day. For momentary, light
affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all
comparison, while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things
which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things
which are not seen are eternal.” (2 Corinthians 4:16-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Peter 5:1, “that is to be” is the present active
participle of <span lang=EL>με</span>́<span lang=EL>λλω</span> (mellō) and means
about to be. Many of the believers to whom Peter was writing were going to
suffer death in one way or another shortly. Intensification of study is needed
because we may be dead in a year or so. If you had a month to live, what would
you change, what would you do?</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Peter was pushing for a principle. We cannot get enough
Bible doctrine is what he was saying. “Revealed” is the present passive
infinitive following a present active participle of <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span
lang=EL>ποκαλυ</span>́<span lang=EL>πτω</span> (apokaluptō). This is a dramatic
present. Many are very close to dying. It means to reveal from the ultimate
source of self. The passive voice means they will receive glory. The infinitive
mood refers to the reality of their dying shortly.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Intensifying Responsibility of the Pastor-teacher</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Peter 5:2, “shepherd the flock of God” is the aorist
active imperative of <span lang=EL>ποιμαι</span>́<span lang=EL>νω</span>
(poimainō) and means to feed, to tend a flock, keep sheep, to shepherd. The
whole principle of the function of the pastorate is bound up in this one word.
The cognate form ποιμήν (poimēn) covers the whole concept of pastor. Feeding the
sheep is only one of the shepherd’s responsibilities.</p>

<p class=Verses>“shepherd the flock of God among you, exercising oversight not
under compulsion, but voluntarily, according to the will of God; and not for
sordid gain, but with eagerness;” (1 Peter 5:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher provides food, spiritual food – Bible
doctrine by daily communication. He provides green pastures – his leadership authority.
The constantive aorist tense stresses the primary function of the pastor - daily
teaching. The active voice means the pastor must initiate the action of the
verb. This requires constant study and constant communication of the Word. The
imperative mood is a command to pastors only, to provide leadership authority
over his flock. The two primary concepts are authority and communication. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“The flock” is <span lang=EL>ποι</span>́<span lang=EL>μνιον</span>
(poimnion) and is a contracted noun that includes all sheep. It is a
contraction of <i>poimen</i> and <i>apnion</i>. Lest the pastor forget and
abuse his authority, it is called the “flock of God.” The genitive of source refers
to relationship. The pastor is the shepherd of the flock, but the flock belongs
to God. He does not own the sheep. “Among you” refers to the local church, one
pastor. Bible doctrine can only be taught by the one having authority.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Peter 5:2, “exercising oversight” is the present
active participle from <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>πισκοπε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (episkopeō) and refers to an inspector general or overseer of
a plantation. “Bishop” is usually the translation. This is doing the job. No
one can teach without authority. 1 Thess. 5:12; Heb. 13:7; Heb. 13:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But we request of you, brethren, that you appreciate those who
diligently labor among you, and have charge over you in the Lord and give you
instruction,” (1 Thessalonians 5:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Remember those who led you, who spoke the word of God to you;
and considering the result of their conduct, imitate their faith.” (Hebrews
13:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch over
your souls as those who will give an account. Let them do this with joy and not
with grief, for this would be unprofitable for you.” (Hebrews 13:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are four attitudes expressed by four adverbs in 1
Peter 5:2. “Not under compulsion” is the negative plus <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span
lang=EL>ναγκαστω</span>͂<span lang=EL>ς</span> (anagkastōs) and means not by
compulsion. If a pastor cannot take the authority, he has no right to take the
leadership of a local church. If he has the pastor-teacher gift, he will
willingly take the responsibility. Many a local church has failed because the
pastor would not assume authority or take the responsibility. The pastor cannot
simply come in and bumble along, stumble along, preach when he can, get outside
speakers in (mostly his friends from Bible school days), is nice to everyone,
and is generally gutless and wants to be loved by everyone.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“But voluntarily” is <span lang=EL>ε</span>̔<span
lang=EL>κουσι</span>́<span lang=EL>ως</span> (hekousiōs) and means
voluntarily, eagerly, taking the authority, being responsible. “Not for sordid
gain” is a strong negative plus <span lang=EL>αι</span>̓<span lang=EL>σχροκερδω</span>͂<span
lang=EL>ς</span> (aischrokerdōs) and means fondness for dishonest gain. The pastor
has a right to renumeration as taught in 1 Corinthians 9:11-14, but he must not
commercialize or sell spiritual benefits of grace.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we sowed spiritual things in you, is it too much if we reap
material things from you? If others share the right over you, do we not more?
Nevertheless, we did not use this right, but we endure all things so that we
will cause no hindrance to the gospel of Christ. Do you not know that those who
perform sacred services eat the food of the temple, and those who attend
regularly to the altar have their share from the altar? So also the Lord
directed those who proclaim the gospel to get their living from the gospel.” (1
Corinthians 9:11-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Grace was never meant to be sold. Grace does not have a
price. Grace is not for sale. This is what this adverb is saying. Nobody can
buy blessing from God. Tithing has nothing to do with grace giving. “But with
eagerness” is <span lang=EL>προθυ</span>́<span lang=EL>μως</span> (prothumōs)
and means to be prepared before. A prepared mind means constant, consistent,
diligent, and daily study of the Word. These four adverbs qualify the verb <i>poimainō</i>.</p>
