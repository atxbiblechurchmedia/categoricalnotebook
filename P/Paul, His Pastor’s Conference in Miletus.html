<h2>Paul, His Pastor’s Conference in Miletus</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul called a pastor’s conference in Acts 20:17. The
elders or pastors attended the conference in Miletus, 36 miles from Ephesus. In
Acts 20:17, “elders” is <span lang=EL>πρεσβυ</span>́<span lang=EL>τερος</span>
(presbuteros) and means a ranking admiral of the fleet, someone in authority. </p>

<p class=Verses>“From Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called to him the elders
of the church.” (Acts 20:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Content of the Pastor’s Conference</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The worst audience in the world can be pastors in
training. Like seminary men, they can be rude and overestimate their own
understanding of the Word and Bible doctrine. In Acts 20:18, “had come to them”
is the aorist middle indicative of <span lang=EL>παραγι</span>́<span lang=EL>νομαι</span>
(paraginomai) and means to be present, to come near, to approach. They came to
the side of and placed themselves under his apostolic authority. He began to
give his credentials. This is no problem for a mature believer.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And when they had come to him, he said to them, &quot;You
yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, how I was with you
the whole time,” (Acts 20:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 20:19; “serving the Lord” is the present active
participle of <span lang=EL>δουλευ</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (douleuō) and
means to be a slave, to serve, to do service. “With all humility” is <span
lang=EL>ταπεινοφροσυ</span>́<span lang=EL>νη</span> (tapeinophrosunē) and
means these men had a spiritually mature grace mental attitude and were following
the Lord’s commands to the letter in implicit obedience. “Tears” refers to the disappointments
of the ministry. Good training for the ministry is military service for about
five years and to receive about five “Dear John” letters. After that, you will have
no illusions about people. </p>

<p class=Verses>“serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and with
trials which came upon me through the plots of the Jews;” (Acts 20:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Trials” refers to testing and passing them with divine
viewpoint. Everyone has pressures but there are unique ones in the ministry. For
example, Paul had religious legalistic pressures always from a dedicated band
of persecutors who followed him around.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul held nothing back. He communicated everything he
knew. Some ministers can do this in a couple of weeks. Everything he gave them
was profitable. He taught Bible doctrine. He repeated it. In Acts 20:20, “declaring
to you” is the aorist active infinitive of <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span
lang=EL>ναγγε</span>́<span lang=EL>λλω</span><span lang=EL> </span>(anaggellō)
and means to declare, to announce, to make known. “Teaching you publicly” is
the aorist active infinitive of <span lang=EL>διδα</span>́<span lang=EL>σκω</span>
(didaskō) and means that he taught categorically and publicly by teaching Bible
doctrine and evangelism. Paul taught house to house, church to church, edifying
all who wanted to hear. </p>

<p class=Verses>“how I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was
profitable, and teaching you publicly and from house to house,” (Acts 20:20,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 20:21, “solemnly testifying” is the present
middle participle of <span lang=EL>διαμαρτυ</span>́<span lang=EL>ρομαι</span>
(diamarturomai) and means to earnestly testify, to charge, to attest, to
solemnly affirm. Paul earnestly communicated the Gospel of Jesus Christ and seeking
“repentance” or <span lang=EL>μετα</span>́<span lang=EL>νοια</span> (metanoia) of
positive unbelievers present. <i>Metanoia</i> means to change one’s mind toward
the Savior who paid for their sins on the Cross.</p>

<p class=Verses>“solemnly testifying to both Jews and Greeks of repentance
toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.” (Acts 20:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 20:22, we see an inkling of disaster. He was
receiving hindrance of the Holy Spirit in going to Jerusalem, but Paul had
rationalized a “Don’t go” into a “Yes, go.” “Not knowing” is the perfect active
participle of <span lang=EL>ει</span>̓́<span lang=EL>δω</span> (eidō) and
means to see, to perceive by any of the senses, to notice, to discern. This was
a very difficult situation, very rare for Paul, but he always knew.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;And now, behold, bound by the Spirit, I am on my way to
Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there,” (Acts 20:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The real Apostle Paul is described in 2 Corinthians 5:1, 2
Corinthians 5:5, and 2 Corinthians 5:8-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For we know that if the earthly tent which is our house is
torn down, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in
the heavens.” (2 Corinthians 5:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now He who prepared us for this very purpose is God, who gave
to us the Spirit as a pledge.” (2 Corinthians 5:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“we are of good courage, I say, and prefer rather to be absent
from the body and to be at home with the Lord. Therefore we also have as our
ambition, whether at home or absent, to be pleasing to Him.” (2 Corinthians
5:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 20:23, God the Holy Spirit was warning Paul of
his wrong direction in going to Jerusalem. There are some principles of
application for us here. A change in locale does not remove pressure. If you
cannot cope with pressure in one locality, you cannot cope with pressure in
another locality. You cannot run away from pressure. It is inside of you.
Therefore, running away does not solve anything. A change in environment does
not solve problems. All problems and pressures are resolved by knowing Bible
doctrine and applying it to experience.</p>

<p class=Verses>“except that the Holy Spirit solemnly testifies to me in every
city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me.” (Acts 20:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 20:24-25, Paul thought he was going to die in
Jerusalem. That inkling was wrong. This was not true. He would see them on his
fourth missionary journey.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But I do not consider my life of any account as dear to
myself, so that I may finish my course and the ministry which I received from
the Lord Jesus, to testify solemnly of the gospel of the grace of God.
&quot;And now, behold, I know that all of you, among whom I went about
preaching the kingdom, will no longer see my face.” (Acts 20:24-25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Paul’s Charge to Pastors </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 20:26, “I am innocent” is an idiom indicating
that Paul has done absolutely everything he could do to make them spiritually
self-sustaining. He had discharged his responsibility.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Therefore, I testify to you this day that I am innocent
of the blood of all men.” (Acts 20:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 20:27, “I did not shrink” is the negative plus
the aorist middle indicative of <span lang=EL>υ</span>̔<span lang=EL>ποστε</span>́<span
lang=EL>λλω</span> (hupostellō) and means to draw back, to let down, to lower,
to withdraw as a timid person. Paul hadn’t held back the communication of Bible
doctrine. “Declaring” is the aorist active infinitive of <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span
lang=EL>ναγγε</span>́<span lang=EL>λλω</span> (anaggellō) and means to
declare, to announce, to make known, to report. “Whole purpose” is <span
lang=EL>βουλη</span>́ (boulē) and means divine purpose, decree, design. Paul
spelled out the purpose of God’s plan. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole
purpose of God.” (Acts 20:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 20:28, “Be on guard” is the present active
imperative of <span lang=EL>προσε</span>́<span lang=EL>χω</span> (prosechō)
and means to face yourselves objectively. “And for all the flock” refers to the
pastor-teacher’s flock, the congregation God has provided for him to teach. “Shepherd
the church of God” is the present active infinitive of <span lang=EL>ποιμαι</span>́<span
lang=EL>νω</span> (poimainō) and means to feed, to tend a flock, to keep sheep,
to nourish.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock, among
which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God
which He purchased with His own blood.” (Acts 20:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 21:15-17 are our Lord’s three mandates for
pastor-teachers; “Tend My lambs,” “Shepherd My sheep,” and “Tend My sheep.” All
are present active imperatives, mandates. To teach you must nave authority.
Some sheep are very hard-headed and unless you have the authority over them
they will never learn. In Acts 20:28, “which He has purchased with His own blood”
refers to Jesus Christ who paid the purchase price of our redemption. He
fulfilled the animal sacrifices. He went to the Cross and paid for the sins of
mankind. </p>

<p class=Verses>“So when they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon
Peter, &quot;Simon, son of John, do you love Me more than these?&quot; He said
to Him, &quot;Yes, Lord; You know that I love You.&quot; He said to him,
&quot;Tend My lambs.&quot; He said to him again a second time, &quot;Simon, son
of John, do you love Me?&quot; He said to Him, &quot;Yes, Lord; You know that I
love You.&quot; He said to him, &quot;Shepherd My sheep.&quot; He said to him
the third time, &quot;Simon, son of John, do you love Me?&quot; Peter was
grieved because He said to him the third time, &quot;Do you love Me?&quot; And
he said to Him, &quot;Lord, You know all things; You know that I love
You.&quot; Jesus said to him, &quot;Tend My sheep.” (John 21:15-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 20:29, Paul warns of unbeliever false teachers
that will appear and lead many astray. “I know” is the perfect active
indicative of <span lang=EL>οι</span>̓͂<span lang=EL>δα</span> (oida) and means
to perceive, to know. This is used as a dramatic present. “Savage wolves” is <span
lang=EL>βαρυ</span>́<span lang=EL>ς</span> (barus) and signifies heavy,
pressure types, obligators, bullies who are rapacious, vicious. This refers to
an unsaved type of false teacher.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I know that after my departure savage wolves will come
in among you, not sparing the flock;” (Acts 20:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>False teachers walk in their own lusts such as approbation
lust - the desire to be recognized and to please people, power lust, and material
lust - catering to the wealthy. 2 Peter 2:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and especially those who indulge the flesh in its corrupt
desires and despise authority. Daring, self-willed, they do not tremble when
they revile angelic majesties,” (2 Peter 2:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>False teachers downgrade Divine Institution #4 - Nationalism.
False teachers tend to be internationalists, ecumenical, and they downgrade the
laws of divine establishment. They are presumptuous, brassy, daring, and cheeky.
They are self-willed and stuck on self. Their will is dominated by their old
sin nature and their emotions. False teachers speak evil and oppose God in the
Angelic Conflict. Outwardly, they seem nice. They sell you first on their
personality then you buy their message because they are nice.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 20:30, we have believer false teachers. Even
though some of these pastors had been trained by Paul in the best seminary ever,
some of them became hooked by false teachers. “Men will arise” is the future
middle indicative of <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>νι</span>́<span
lang=EL>στημι</span> (anistēmi) and means to revolt against, to benefit
themselves. This is shocking.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and from among your own selves men will arise, speaking
perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them.” (Acts 20:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Speaking perverse things” is the present active
participle of <span lang=EL>λαλε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (laleō) plus
the perfect passive participle of <span lang=EL>διαστρε</span>́<span lang=EL>φω</span>
(diastrephō) and means perverted, distorted, corrupted, that which opposes the
saving purposes and plans of God. False teachers place emphasis on study under them
to get the true pitch. They have human personality emphasis, activity,
programs, involvement, social action, and salesmanship Christianity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“To draw away” is the present active infinitive of <span
lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>ποσπα</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (apospaō)
and means to wrench away with violence, to seduce because of their personality.
They sell themselves. This can be a pastor with his wrong congregation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 20:31, “Therefore be on the alert” is the present
active imperative of <span lang=EL>γρηγορευ</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(grēgoreuō) and means to be alert with regard to yourself. Every pastor must
be constantly alert with regard to himself. He must be alert that he sticks to
the teaching of the Word. Teach everything - “All the counsel of God.”</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Therefore be on the alert, remembering that night and
day for a period of three years I did not cease to admonish each one with
tears.” (Acts 20:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If we fail to regard ourselves from the standpoint of the
Word of God, then we’ll slip into a system. “Remembering” is the present active
participle of <span lang=EL>μνημονευ</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(mnēmoneuō) and means to be mindful of, to remember, to call to mind what was
taught. They must keep on remembering the Bible doctrine that was taught to
them, not Paul’s energy or personality. There is nothing is more important than
Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the soul. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“I did not cease” is the aorist middle indicative of <span
lang=EL>παυ</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (pauō) and means to make to cease or
desist, to restrain a thing or person from something. This will explain the
tears later on. “Admonish each one” is the present active participle of <span
lang=EL>νουθετε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (noutheteō) and means to place
in the mind. This is Bible doctrine being communicated and understood and
transferred by the Holy Spirit into the left lobe of the soul. The
pastor-teacher’s responsibility is to get biblical information into your mind.
He can’t make them exercise faith belief in the doctrine taught. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 20:32, we have Paul’s deposits of Bible doctrine.
“And now I commend you” refers to all pastors who were all believers. Pastors
must be believers. This is not true in this country. “Commend” is the present
middle indicative of <span lang=EL>παρατι</span>́<span lang=EL>θημι</span>
(paratithēmi) and means to make a deposit. Paul did it himself by studying and
communicating. Paul deposited Bible doctrine with these pastors. These men needed
Bible doctrine. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;And now I commend you to God and to the word of His
grace, which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all
those who are sanctified.” (Acts 20:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every believer deposits his life with the Lord. In the
spiritual life, God deposits Bible doctrine in our souls and empowers us. 2
Tim. 1:12; 2 Tim. 1:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason I also suffer these things, but I am not
ashamed; for I know whom I have believed and I am convinced that He is able to
guard what I have entrusted to Him until that day.” (2 Timothy 1:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Guard, through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us, the treasure
which has been entrusted to you.” (2 Timothy 1:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer deposits with the Lord their cares,
problems, frustrations, heartaches, and pressures. 1 Peter 4:19; 1 Peter 5:7;
Psalms 55:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, those also who suffer according to the will of God
shall entrust their souls to a faithful Creator in doing what is right.” (1
Peter 4:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“casting all your anxiety on Him, because He cares for you.” (1
Peter 5:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Cast your burden upon the LORD and He will sustain you; He
will never allow the righteous to be shaken.” (Psalms 55:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer deposits the Gospel with unbelievers. The
believer in their spiritual life also deposits Bible doctrine with other
believers. In Acts 20:32, “word of His grace” means that all of their teaching
must be compatible with grace. They must be grace oriented in all that they do.
It is Bible doctrine that does the job. Never get your eyes on the personality
of the pastor. You are to concentrate on the content of Bible doctrine. Rom.
1:14; 2 Tim. 2:2. </p>

<p class=Verses>“I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians, both
to the wise and to the foolish.” (Romans 1:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The things which you have heard from me in the presence of
many witnesses, entrust these to faithful men who will be able to teach others
also.” (2 Timothy 2:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 20:32, “which is able” is the present passive
participle of <span lang=EL>δυ</span>́<span lang=EL>ναμαι</span> (dunamai) and
means to be capable, strong and powerful. “To build you up” is the aorist
active infinitive of <span lang=EL>οι</span>̓<span lang=EL>κοδομε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (oikodomeō) and means to grow in wisdom, to mature you. This
refers to the erection of the edification complex of the soul. “Give you the
inheritance” is the sum total of God’s plan for you in this life. “Among all
those who are sanctified” is the perfect passive participle of <span lang=EL>α</span>̔<span
lang=EL>για</span>́<span lang=EL>ζω</span> (hagiazō). The greatest thing God
can do for you is to make you like His Son and He does it in three phases. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>First there is Positional Sanctification where God the
Holy Spirit places the believer into permanent union with Christ at salvation.
This is also called Baptism of the Spirit. God does 40 things for you at the
moment of salvation. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/S/The%2040%20Things%20Received%20at%20Salvation.html">The 40
Things Received at Salvation</a>. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Secondly, there is Experiential Sanctification and the
believer grows spiritually resulting in the building of their edification
complex of the soul. Thirdly, we all receive Ultimate Sanctification when we
receive our resurrection body at the Rapture of the Church.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Paul’s Motivation For Holding the Pastor’s Conference</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Later on, the pastors will be grateful to the first one
who gave them Bible doctrine. Paul had not set his desire for any man’s money. Paul
had not lusted for the principle of wealth. He had not lusted for materialistic
things like nice clothes. Acts 20:33.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I have coveted no one's silver or gold or clothes.”
(Acts 20:33, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul did not cater to the wealthy people in the
congregation. There are ministers who do. There are some pastors who watch the
wealthy people in their churches who demand special attention and catering.
When Paul walked into Ephesus, there were wealthy men in the congregation and
he didn’t cater to them.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sometimes pastors have a tendency to hob-nob with the
wealthy. They hob-nob with those who have wealth and eventually get a hand-out
from them. This is wrong. What is envy? “I wish I had a set of wheels like
that!” That can be said half in jest. You can’t communicate and covet at the
same time.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>That doesn’t mean pastors have to be poor. Some say that
the average income of a pastor should be on par with the people in the
congregation. That is malarkey. A pastor’s income has nothing to do with the
principle of giving.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We’ve spent a lot of time talking about Paul working and
why he did. Originally, Paul was the president of the seminary and in that
position provided the doctrine to build the men up and also the money to
sustain their basic needs. Paul worked and supported the seminary students. The
principle here is that the local church ought to support the pastor-teacher so
that they can focus exclusively on studying and teaching categorical Bible doctrine.
Acts 20:34.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my
own needs and to the men who were with me.” (Acts 20:34, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 20:35, “In everything I showed you” means he has
made an issue out of doctrine. He also taught them a principle of grace giving.
“You must help” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>ντιλαμβα</span>́<span
lang=EL>νομαι</span> (antilambanomai) and conveys the principle of grace
support. You take your turn at bat in helping someone else.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;In everything I showed you that by working hard in this
manner you must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that He
Himself said, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'&quot;” (Acts 20:35,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“The weak” are those in need of money because of tragedy.
Our Lord had said earlier that “It is more blessed to give than to receive.”
Giving must express the principles of grace to be true giving. The principle of
grace depends upon the character of the giver.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer is to give motivated solely by the <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine in their soul, not because the needy deserve it. Often the needs
are in the opposite place of deserving, obnoxious. But deserving is not the
issue in giving. The issue in giving is your stability of character and grace
motivation. </p>
