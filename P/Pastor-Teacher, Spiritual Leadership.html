<h2>Pastor-Teacher, Spiritual Leadership</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The spiritual leadership of the pastor-teacher protects
national stability. In the Church Age, the pastor-teacher is the man for a
national crisis. 2 Tim. 2:3-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Suffer hardship with me, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. No
soldier in active service entangles himself in the affairs of everyday life, so
that he may please the one who enlisted him as a soldier.” (2 Timothy 2:3-4,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher must be oriented to the times in which
he lives. In the Church Age, there will always be wars and rumors of wars. Only
in the Millennium will Jesus Christ bring world peace. Matt. 24:6; Isaiah 2:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You will be hearing of wars and rumors of wars. See that
you are not frightened, for those things must take place, but that is not yet
the end.” (Matthew 24:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He will judge between the nations, And will render
decisions for many peoples; And they will hammer their swords into plowshares
and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not lift up sword against
nation, And never again will they learn war.” (Isaiah 2:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mankind is controlled by their old sin natures. James
4:1-2. </p>

<p class=Verses>“What is the source of quarrels and conflicts among you? Is not
the source your pleasures that wage war in your members? You lust and do not
have; so you commit murder. You are envious and cannot obtain; so you fight and
quarrel. You do not have because you do not ask.” (James 4:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Rejection of the truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
causes divisions and conflict in families. Families in a time of apostacy
cannot unify a nation. Matt. 10:34-36.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Do not think that I came to bring peace on the earth; I
did not come to bring peace, but a sword. &quot;For I came to SET A MAN AGAINST
HIS FATHER, AND A DAUGHTER AGAINST HER MOTHER, AND A DAUGHTER-IN-LAW AGAINST
HER MOTHER-IN-LAW; and A MAN'S ENEMIES WILL BE THE MEMBERS OF HIS HOUSEHOLD.”
(Matthew 10:34-36, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher must know the difference between
killing and murder, lying and deceiving the enemy. In Exodus 20:13 in the King
James Version, “kill” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL>רצח</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(râtsach) in the Hebrew and means to
murder. Later, in the New American Standard Version of the Bible, the word was
corrected to be “murder.” </p>

<p class=Verses>“Thou shalt not kill.” (Exodus 20:13, KJV) </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You shall not murder.” (Exodus 20:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew word for “kill” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL>נכה</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(nâkâh) as used in
Joshua 20:3 which describes manslaughter rather than murder. Human life can be
taken biblically in an act of war like in Joshua’s generation and when a
governmental authority administers capital punishment like in Genesis 9:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“that the manslayer who kills any person unintentionally,
without premeditation, may flee there, and they shall become your refuge from
the avenger of blood.” (Joshua 20:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Whoever sheds man's blood, By man his blood shall be
shed, For in the image of God He made man.” (Genesis 9:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher must have an excellent mental attitude
with an emphasis on patience. A believer with a maturing edification complex of
the soul at 20 years old can enter into a very responsible period of their
life. The battle is in the mind. For example, David against Goliath. Rom. 7:15;
Rom. 7:23; 1 Sam. 17:26; 1 Sam. 17:32; 1 Sam. 17:36. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For what I am doing, I do not understand; for I am not
practicing what I would like to do, but I am doing the very thing I hate.”
(Romans 7:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“but I see a different law in the members of my body, waging
war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin which
is in my members.” (Romans 7:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then David spoke to the men who were standing by him, saying,
&quot;What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and takes away
the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he
should taunt the armies of the living God?&quot;” (1 Samuel 17:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“David said to Saul, &quot;Let no man's heart fail on account
of him; your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.&quot;” (1 Samuel
17:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear; and
this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, since he has taunted
the armies of the living God.&quot;” (1 Samuel 17:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher must combat the three greatest
problems he faces in his ministry - fear, unbelief, and disrespect for
authority. 1 Sam. 17:3-10; 1 Sam. 17:23ff; 1 Sam. 17:33; Prov. 30:11-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel and said to them,
&quot;Why do you come out to draw up in battle array? Am I not the Philistine
and you servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves and let him come down to
me. &quot;If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will become your
servants; but if I prevail against him and kill him, then you shall become our
servants and serve us.&quot; Again the Philistine said, &quot;I defy the ranks
of Israel this day; give me a man that we may fight together.&quot; When Saul
and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and
greatly afraid.” (1 Samuel 17:8-11, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then David left his baggage in the care of the baggage keeper,
and ran to the battle line and entered in order to greet his brothers. As he
was talking with them, behold, the champion, the Philistine from Gath named
Goliath, was coming up from the army of the Philistines, and he spoke these
same words; and David heard them. When all the men of Israel saw the man, they
fled from him and were greatly afraid.” (1 Samuel 17:22-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Saul said to David, &quot;You are not able to go against
this Philistine to fight with him; for you are but a youth while he has been a
warrior from his youth.&quot;” (1 Samuel 17:33, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“There is a kind of man whose teeth are like swords And his jaw
teeth like knives, To devour the afflicted from the earth And the needy from
among men. The leech has two daughters, &quot;Give,&quot; &quot;Give.&quot;
There are three things that will not be satisfied, Four that will not say,
&quot;Enough&quot;: Sheol, and the barren womb, Earth that is never satisfied
with water, And fire that never says, &quot;Enough.&quot; The eye that mocks a
father And scorns a mother, The ravens of the valley will pick it out, And the
young eagles will eat it.” (Proverbs 30:14-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher must stay positive to Bible doctrine
throughout his ministry. The parable of the great banquet in Luke 9:16-35
speaks of feeding on the Word of God due to positive volition. Not all will
respond to Bible doctrine being taught categorically. For those who do respond
with positive volition, the results are spiritual maturing and endurance of
soul. This endurance results in a preserving effect in the nation. The strategy
of consistent positive volition is also winning in the Angelic Conflict.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 5:13-16, “salt” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̔́<span
lang=EL>λας</span> (halas) in the Greek and refers to the use of salt as a
preservative and by analogy refers to the preservative effect brought to a
nation from the <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the souls of believers. Salt
is Bible doctrine with regard to the Divine Institutions. Salt is Bible
doctrine in the souls of believers enduring by consistent positive volition to
the intake and application of Bible doctrine. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“But if the salt has become tasteless” is the aorist
passive subjunctive of <span lang=EL>μωραι</span>́<span lang=EL>νω</span>
(mōrainō) and refers to salt that has lost its strength and flavor. By
analogy, this refers to believers with negative volition cease to be a
stabilizing influence or preservative of the nation.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt has
become tasteless, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for
anything, except to be thrown out and trampled under foot by men. &quot;You are
the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden; nor does anyone
light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on the lampstand, and it gives
light to all who are in the house. &quot;Let your light shine before men in
such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in
heaven.” (Matthew 5:13-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 5:13-16, “light” is <span lang=EL>φω</span>͂<span
lang=EL>ς</span> (phōs) in the Greek and refers to the illumination brought by
Bible doctrine. God from the essence standpoint is light. The positive volition
principle of salt is that enduring leads to the positive volition principle of
light that leads to glorifying God. The edification complex of the soul in
maturing believers becomes a light house of the applied Word of God. Once the
light house in the soul is erected, it should continue to shine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher must be taught in order to learn and
to teach. In 2 Timothy 2:2, there are four verbs of interest. “Heard” is the
aorist active indicative of <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>κου</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (akouō) with the emphasis on hearing, not reading. “Entrust”
is the aorist middle imperative of <span lang=EL>παρατι</span>́<span lang=EL>θημι</span>
(paratithēmi) and means to place alongside, to deposit, to entrust, to train
in accordance with the rules of the military, to prepare the gift of the
individual.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The things which you have heard from me in the presence of
many witnesses, entrust these to faithful men who will be able to teach others
also.”  (2 Timothy 2:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Will be” is future middle indicative of <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓́<span
lang=EL>σομαι</span> (esomai) and refers to the teaching of those taught and is
always future regarding their training. “Teach” is the aorist active infinitive
of <span lang=EL>διδα</span>́<span lang=EL>σκω</span> (didaskō). The
infinitive mood expresses that the purpose of the instruction is that the ones
taught, may teach one day “others also.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher must develop a toughness that endures
the best the enemy can muster. In 2 Timothy 2:3, the verb for “suffer” is <span
lang=EL>συγκακοπαθε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (sugkakopatheō) and is an
aorist active imperative and means to suffer evil. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Suffer hardship with me, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.” 
(2 Timothy 2:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher must develop a rigid discipline in
regard to the details of life. In 2 Timothy 2:4, “soldier in active service” is
<span lang=EL>στρατευ</span>́<span lang=EL>ομαι</span> (strateuomai) and means
to do military duty, be on active service, be a soldier, to fight in battle.
“Entangles himself in the affairs of everyday life” is <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span
lang=EL>μπλε</span>́<span lang=EL>κω</span> (emplekō) and means to receive
entanglement, to get caught in a web of details such as finances etc. “So that
he may please” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>ρε</span>́<span lang=EL>σκω</span>
(areskō) and means to strive to please. Being a subjunctive, it is potentially
possible. “The one who enlisted him as a soldier” is <span lang=EL>στρατολογε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (stratologeō) and means to name, or call as a soldier and
refers to the soldier’s commander.</p>

<p class=Verses>“No soldier in active service entangles himself in the affairs
of everyday life, so that he may please the one who enlisted him as a soldier.” 
(2 Timothy 2:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher must exhibit progress, performance,
and competitive ability in the Angelic Conflict. In 2 Timothy 2:5, “if anyone
competes as an athlete” is <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>α</span>́<span
lang=EL>ν</span> (ean) plus the present active subjunctive of <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span
lang=EL>θλε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (athleō) and means to contend in
games, to wrestle, in a contest. Here, “if” is a third class condition and
means maybe he will, maybe he won’t. This refers the Angelic Conflict. This is
where you get vocabulary to teach. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Also if anyone competes as an athlete, he does not win the
prize unless he competes according to the rules.”  (2 Timothy 2:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 9:24, “those who run in a race” refers
to all believers who are running in a race in the Angelic Conflict in the
spiritual life. “Receives the prize” is <span lang=EL>βραβει</span>͂<span
lang=EL>ον</span> (brabeion) and refers to an umpire who decides, arbitrates,
and rules. This umpire is none other than the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but only
one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may win.” (1 Corinthians
9:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 9:25, “competes” is the present middle
participle of <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>γωνι</span>́<span lang=EL>ζομαι</span>
(agōnizomai) and means to strive, to contend with adversaries, to fight, to
struggle with difficulties and dangers, to endeavor with strenuous zeal to
obtain something. The principle is that you compete to win. “Exercises
self-control” is the present middle indicative of <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span
lang=EL>γκρατευ</span>́<span lang=EL>ομαι</span> (egkrateuomai) and means to be
disciplined, to have self-control. This is the inner strength to put yourself
under rigorous discipline.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Everyone who competes in the games exercises self-control in
all things. They then do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an
imperishable.” (1 Corinthians 9:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 9:26, “not without aim” is <span
lang=EL>ουκ</span><span lang=EL> </span><span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>δη</span>́<span
lang=EL>λως</span> (ouk adēlōs) and is the strongest Greek negative when used
with a negative word, the negative alpha being there. It denotes blindness,
indistinct or uncertain eyesight, in other words, “don’t run blind.” The
terrific pressure of the Angelic Conflict causes aberrations, etc., like
Pentecostalism.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore I run in such a way, as not without aim; I box in
such a way, as not beating the air;” (1 Corinthians 9:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“I box” is <span lang=EL>πυκτε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(pukteō) and means a boxer, a pugilist. I punch where it counts! “Not beating
the air” is <span lang=EL>δε</span>́<span lang=EL>ρω</span> (derō) and means
to beat, to thrash, to smite. It means a violent blow, a thrashing about
activity like a whirlwind. This is the punch of a mature believer, not the
punch of a shadow boxer.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In l Corinthians 9:27, “I discipline” is the present
active indicative of <span lang=EL>υ</span>̔<span lang=EL>πωπια</span>́<span
lang=EL>ζω</span> (hupōpiazō) and means a blow on the face, the part of the
face below the eyes. It means to strike under the eye, to give a black eye, to
wear out, to buffet to bruise. This is severe self-discipline. This was a way
of life to him! “Make it my slave” is the present active indicative of <span
lang=EL>δουλαγωγε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (doulagōgeō) and means to
make a slave, to bring or lead a slave, to labor in slavery. It is stronger
than <i>hupotasso</i> or <i>upakouo</i>. It means to give the body no rights. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“I have preached” is <span lang=EL>κηρυ</span>́<span
lang=EL>σσω</span> (kērussō) and refers to the proclamation of a king, with
full authority. “I myself will not be” is the aorist middle subjunctive of <span
lang=EL>γι</span>́<span lang=EL>νομαι</span> (ginomai) and means he might
become something he was not been before, a dropout, a failure. “Disqualified”
is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>δο</span>́<span lang=EL>κιμος</span>
(adokimos) and means not standing the test, to be rejected, to be disqualified,
to fail the test. </p>

<p class=Verses>“but I discipline my body and make it my slave, so that, after
I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified.” (1 Corinthians
9:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher must be prepared to live in the face
of death. There are four possible reasons why soldiers die in war; to glorify
the Lord, their work on earth is finished, the sin unto death, or suicide. Job
5:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;In famine He will redeem you from death, And in war from
the power of the sword.” (Job 5:20, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor’s authority over the local church is exercised on
the basis of his spiritual gift given by God the Holy Spirit at the moment of
salvation and therefore he is appointed by the Holy Spirit, plus content. The
pastor must not use his office or his authority to bully the congregation or to
express vindictiveness. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Peter 5:3, “nor yet” is <span lang=EL>μηδε</span>́
(mēde) and means “not so much as” and “lording it over” is <span lang=EL>κατακυριευ</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (katakurieuō) and means to exercise dominion over, but not so
much as being bullies.</p>

<p class=Verses>“nor yet as lording it over those allotted to your charge, but
proving to be examples to the flock.” (1 Peter 5:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Teaching the Word of God carries with it the highest
authority in the local church. Therefore, the pastor-teacher must beware of power
lust. Approbation lust is also a danger to his ministry. On the other hand, the
pastor must avoid the opposite extreme of letting the congregation run over
him. He is not a football or a doormat for the congregation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor must exercise his authority in the application
of Bible doctrine and the filling of the Holy Spirit. He must be impartial,
just and fair in the use of his authority. In 1 Peter 5:3, “those allotted” is <span
lang=EL>κλη</span>͂<span lang=EL>ρος</span> (klēros) and conveys the concept
that there is a right pastor for a right congregation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If the some of the believers in the congregation have the
wrong pastor, they are going to be miserable, unfed, and unfulfilled. If the
pastor feels that he has the wrong congregation, he is going to be miserable,
out of place, and not able to exercise his authority.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One of the most important doctrines there is for the
believer to find the right pastor-teacher for them so they can accept his
authority and thereby grow spiritually. It is also true for the pastor-teacher
to ensure that the local church to which he has been called in the right
congregation for him to fully teach the Word of God on a categorical basis.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Klēros</i> indicates that the sheep belong to God.
The pastor is an under shepherd who cares for the sheep and the pastor is under
divine management. God has designed at any particular time in history a right
pastor for a right church.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is a grave mistake to go where you like the scenery,
or go where you like the people, or to limit yourself to certain parts of the
world in order to stay close to relatives, or to choose a sunny climate with no
snow, or to choose a wet climate with no snow. Remember that every flock is
different. Some are tough, some are tender, and some are confused. But, God in
His perfect wisdom, always knows what a congregation needs, more than they do.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is amusing that a congregation votes for a pastor.
That is never mentioned or authorized in the Word of God. Their vote doesn’t
mean a thing. I suppose voting humors a congregation, but it really isn’t too
meaningful. However, through voting many a right congregation has been able to
get together with their right pastor. So it all works out.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A pastor can often determine if he has the wrong
congregation. Symptoms include; they aren’t learning anything under him, they
still hold to non-eternal security, and he is having to bully them instead of
teaching them. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Peter 5:3, “but proving to be examples” is the
present active indicative of <span lang=EL>τυ</span>́<span lang=EL>πος</span>
(tupos) and means that this is not personality imitation or behavior molding.
This is soul molding. This demands that the pastor have a completed edification
complex of the soul, to be spiritually mature. He must have a maximum amount of
Bible doctrine in the right lobe of his soul. By being so, the pastor-teacher
completes his sheep and fulfills their souls. All teaching of the Word of God
comes from the pastor.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“To the flock” means the sheep are absolutely no good
without supervision. For example, in some locations in the western U.S., the
coyotes and wild dogs take a real toll on the lamb population. They need
supervision. You can’t turn sheep loose like you can cattle.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God does not mean that believers in the Church Age are to
be without supervision. Therefore, every believer must have a pastor. There is
not a sheep anywhere for whom God has not allotted a pastor. This is important.
Floating believers never accept the authority of any pastor. Therefore, they
never grow spiritually. </p>
