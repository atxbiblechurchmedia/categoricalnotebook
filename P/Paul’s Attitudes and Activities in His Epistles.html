<h2><a name="_Attitudes_and_Activities"></a><a name="_Paul,_Attitudes_and"></a>Paul’s
Attitudes and Activities in His Epistles</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Romans</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul often desired to come to the Roman believers but had
been kept from it. Paul stated that he had preached the Gospel from Jerusalem
to Illyricum (Dalmatia). Rom. 1:13; Rom. 15:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I do not want you to be unaware, brethren, that often I have
planned to come to you (and have been prevented so far) so that I may obtain
some fruit among you also, even as among the rest of the Gentiles.” (Romans
1:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Spirit;
so that from Jerusalem and round about as far as Illyricum I have fully
preached the gospel of Christ.” (Romans 15:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul planned to take a trip to Spain. At the writing of
Romans, Paul was heading to Jerusalem on his third journey. Paul planned to
take a contribution to Jerusalem, then go to Spain and stop off at Rome on his
way. Rom. 15:24-28.</p>

<p class=Verses>“whenever I go to Spain—for I hope to see you in passing, and
to be helped on my way there by you, when I have first enjoyed your company for
a while— but now, I am going to Jerusalem serving the saints. For Macedonia and
Achaia have been pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the saints
in Jerusalem. Yes, they were pleased to do so, and they are indebted to them.
For if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual things, they are indebted to
minister to them also in material things. Therefore, when I have finished this,
and have put my seal on this fruit of theirs, I will go on by way of you to
Spain.” (Romans 15:24-28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>1 Corinthians</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul had been told of the problems in Corinth. Paul
rehearsed how he came to them in simplicity of speech, not on the human wisdom
principle. This would be a Corinthian visit. Paul referred to Apollos being
there at Corinth. 1 Cor. 1:11; 1 Cor. 2:1-4; 1 Cor. 3:5-6. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For I have been informed concerning you, my brethren, by
Chloe's people, that there are quarrels among you.” (1 Corinthians 1:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And when I came to you, brethren, I did not come with
superiority of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God.
For I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ, and Him
crucified. I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling, and my
message and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in
demonstration of the Spirit and of power,” (1 Corinthians 2:1-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? Servants through whom
you believed, even as the Lord gave opportunity to each one. I planted, Apollos
watered, but God was causing the growth.” (1 Corinthians 3:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul wrote about sending Timothy on a mission to Corinth
in 1 Corinthians 4:17. Paul planned to come to the Corinthians shortly after
the letter he was writing them in 1 Corinthians 4:19. Paul referred in 1 Corinthians
5:9 that he had written an epistle to them, probably a note accompanying
Timothy. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason I have sent to you Timothy, who is my beloved
and faithful child in the Lord, and he will remind you of my ways which are in
Christ, just as I teach everywhere in every church.” (1 Corinthians 4:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But I will come to you soon, if the Lord wills, and I shall
find out, not the words of those who are arrogant but their power.” (1
Corinthians 4:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“I wrote you in my letter not to associate with immoral
people;” (1 Corinthians 5:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul had received the information concerning the problems
at Corinth in writing in 1 Corinthians 7:1. Paul referred to the fact that he
had utilized the gift of tongues in his ministry in part in 1 Corinthians
14:18. Paul refers to his instruction to the Galatian churches and also the
Corinthian church about the collection for the saints in 1 Corinthians 11:1. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Now concerning the things about which you wrote, it is good
for a man not to touch a woman.” (1 Corinthians 7:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“I thank God, I speak in tongues more than you all;” (1
Corinthians 14:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Be imitators of me, just as I also am of Christ.” (1
Corinthians 11:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul planned to come to Corinth, pick up the collection
and send it back to Jerusalem with whomever they choose. He said he might also
accompany it back as he planned a return trip through Macedonia on his third
missionary journey in 1 Corinthians 16:2-5.  Paul referred to the possibility
of him staying at Corinth all winter with them in 1 Corinthians 16:6. Paul did
plan to do the above or certainly stay at Ephesus until Pentecost in 1 Corinthians
16:8. </p>

<p class=Verses>“On the first day of every week each one of you is to put aside
and save, as he may prosper, so that no collections be made when I come. When I
arrive, whomever you may approve, I will send them with letters to carry your
gift to Jerusalem; and if it is fitting for me to go also, they will go with
me. But I will come to you after I go through Macedonia, for I am going through
Macedonia;” (1 Corinthians 16:2-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and perhaps I will stay with you, or even spend the winter, so
that you may send me on my way wherever I may go.” (1 Corinthians 16:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But I will remain in Ephesus until Pentecost;” (1 Corinthians
16:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul referred to Timothy going to Corinth and Apollos
refusing to go to Corinth even in spite of Paul’s request in 1 Corinthians
16:12. Paul referred to assistance he received from Stephanas, Fortunatus, and
Achaicus in 1 Corinthians 16:17. Paul sent greetings to Corinth from the
churches at Asia in 1 Corinthians 16:19. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But concerning Apollos our brother, I encouraged him greatly
to come to you with the brethren; and it was not at all his desire to come now,
but he will come when he has opportunity.” (1 Corinthians 16:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“I rejoice over the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and
Achaicus, because they have supplied what was lacking on your part.” (1
Corinthians 16:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The churches of Asia greet you. Aquila and Prisca greet you
heartily in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.” (1 Corinthians
16:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>2 Corinthians</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul referred his greeting to the Corinth church as from
Paul and Timothy. It was Paul’s desire to make a second trip to Corinth on his
third missionary journey. 2 Cor. 1:15-16. </p>

<p class=Verses>“In this confidence I intended at first to come to you, so that
you might twice receive a blessing; that is, to pass your way into Macedonia,
and again from Macedonia to come to you, and by you to be helped on my journey
to Judea.” (2 Corinthians 1:15-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul delayed his trip to Corinth to spare them. Paul
referred to having written to them before 1 Corinthians or possibly
correspondence with Timothy. Paul had not made connections with Titus as
planned, so went on to Corinth. 2 Cor. 1:23; 2 Cor. 2:3; 2 Cor. 2:13. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But I call God as witness to my soul, that to spare you I did
not come again to Corinth.” (2 Corinthians 1:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“This is the very thing I wrote you, so that when I came, I
would not have sorrow from those who ought to make me rejoice; having
confidence in you all that my joy would be the joy of you all.” (2 Corinthians
2:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“I had no rest for my spirit, not finding Titus my brother; but
taking my leave of them, I went on to Macedonia.” (2 Corinthians 2:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Titus and Paul made connections in Macedonia with Titus
bringing good news of Corinth to Paul. Paul refers to his former epistle as making
them sorry, but it also made them rejoice. Paul refers to Titus being
responsible to assist the Corinthian church in getting on a responsible grace
giving basis. 2 Cor. 7:6-7; 2 Cor. 7:8-16; 2 Cor. 8:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But God, who comforts the depressed, comforted us by the
coming of Titus; and not only by his coming, but also by the comfort with which
he was comforted in you, as he reported to us your longing, your mourning, your
zeal for me; so that I rejoiced even more.” (2 Corinthians 7:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For though I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret
it; though I did regret it—for I see that that letter caused you sorrow, though
only for a while—” (2 Corinthians 7:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“I now rejoice, not that you were made sorrowful, but that you
were made sorrowful to the point of repentance; for you were made sorrowful
according to the will of God, so that you might not suffer loss in anything
through us.” (2 Corinthians 7:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So we urged Titus that as he had previously made a beginning,
so he would also complete in you this gracious work as well.” (2 Corinthians
8:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul referred to the Corinthians as being willing to give
a year earlier. Paul referred to having sent a “brother” with Titus to Corinth.
Paul referred to himself and others administering the funds of the collection
given by the Corinthian church. 2 Cor. 8:10; 2 Cor. 8:18; 2 Cor. 8:20. </p>

<p class=Verses>“I give my opinion in this matter, for this is to your
advantage, who were the first to begin a year ago not only to do this, but also
to desire to do it.” (2 Corinthians 8:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“We have sent along with him the brother whose fame in the
things of the gospel has spread through all the churches;” (2 Corinthians 8:18,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“taking precaution so that no one will discredit us in our
administration of this generous gift;” (2 Corinthians 8:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul referred to Achaia as being ready to give a year earlier.
Paul refused to take the funds and wages from the Corinthians because he knew
they were just waiting for him to try this on them. He was smarter than their
plan to catch him. 2 Cor. 9:2; 2 Cor. 11:7-12. </p>

<p class=Verses>“for I know your readiness, of which I boast about you to the
Macedonians, namely, that Achaia has been prepared since last year, and your
zeal has stirred up most of them.” (2 Corinthians 9:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Or did I commit a sin in humbling myself so that you might be
exalted, because I preached the gospel of God to you without charge?” (2
Corinthians 11:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But what I am doing I will continue to do, so that I may cut
off opportunity from those who desire an opportunity to be regarded just as we
are in the matter about which they are boasting.” (2 Corinthians 11:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 11:23-29, Paul reviews his sufferings,
his bad treatment, his beatings, his being whipped, being stoned, being
imprisoned, his difficult and dangerous journeys, and many hardships. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Are they servants of Christ?—I speak as if insane—I more so;
in far more labors, in far more imprisonments, beaten times without number,
often in danger of death. Five times I received from the Jews thirty-nine
lashes. Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I
was shipwrecked, a night and a day I have spent in the deep. I have been on
frequent journeys, in dangers from rivers, dangers from robbers, dangers from
my countrymen, dangers from the Gentiles, dangers in the city, dangers in the
wilderness, dangers on the sea, dangers among false brethren; I have been in
labor and hardship, through many sleepless nights, in hunger and thirst, often
without food, in cold and exposure. Apart from such external things, there is
the daily pressure on me of concern for all the churches. Who is weak without
my being weak? Who is led into sin without my intense concern?” (2 Corinthians
11:23-29, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul was sought after in Damascus by the Roman garrison
as a criminal. He escaped over the wall at Damascus. He was “caught up” and saw
things he couldn’t tell about. 2 Cor. 11:32; 2 Cor. 11:33; 2 Cor. 12:4. </p>

<p class=Verses>“In Damascus the ethnarch under Aretas the king was guarding
the city of the Damascenes in order to seize me,” (2 Corinthians 11:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall,
and so escaped his hands.” (2 Corinthians 11:33, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“was caught up into Paradise and heard inexpressible words,
which a man is not permitted to speak.” (2 Corinthians 12:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He had a thorn in the flesh that he tried to remove but
couldn’t. He referred again to sending Titus to them. 2 Cor. 12:7; 2 Cor.
12:18. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, for
this reason, to keep me from exalting myself, there was given me a thorn in the
flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me—to keep me from exalting myself!” (2
Corinthians 12:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“I urged Titus to go, and I sent the brother with him. Titus
did not take any advantage of you, did he? Did we not conduct ourselves in the
same spirit and walk in the same steps?” (2 Corinthians 12:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 13:1, Paul referred to a third time
ministering to Corinth. The first was in person and the second was in 1 Corinthians.</p>

<p class=Verses>“This is the third time I am coming to you. EVERY FACT IS TO BE
CONFIRMED BY THE TESTIMONY OF TWO OR THREE WITNESSES.” (2 Corinthians 13:1,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Galatians </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul had received his revelation directly from God. Paul
had been directly and successfully involved in the Jewish religion of his day. Gal.
1:12; Gal. 1:13-14. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but I
received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ.” (Galatians 1:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For you have heard of my former manner of life in Judaism, how
I used to persecute the church of God beyond measure and tried to destroy it;
and I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries among my
countrymen, being more extremely zealous for my ancestral traditions.”
(Galatians 1:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul had been personally involved in the destruction of
the churches of believers prior to his salvation. Paul first went to Arabia
after the initial time at Damascus then returned to Damascus. Paul went to
Jerusalem three years later and saw Peter and James. Gal. 1:13-14; Gal. 1:23;
Gal. 1:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For you have heard of my former manner of life in Judaism, how
I used to persecute the church of God beyond measure and tried to destroy it;
and I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries among my
countrymen, being more extremely zealous for my ancestral traditions.”
(Galatians 1:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“but only, they kept hearing, &quot;He who once persecuted us
is now preaching the faith which he once tried to destroy.&quot;” (Galatians
1:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before
me; but I went away to Arabia, and returned once more to Damascus.” (Galatians
1:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul went through Syria and Cilicia preaching. Syria is
comparable to Antioch and Cilicia is comparable to Tarsus. Paul went to
Jerusalem for the council and for public meeting of the congregation. Paul
attended the private meeting of the heads of the church, the apostles, and the
Pharisee believers. Gal. 1:21; Gal. 2:1-2; Gal. 2:2-10. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.” (Galatians
1:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then after an interval of fourteen years I went up again to
Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along also. It was because of a
revelation that I went up; and I submitted to them the gospel which I preach
among the Gentiles, but I did so in private to those who were of reputation,
for fear that I might be running, or had run, in vain.” (Galatians 2:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But it was because of the false brethren secretly brought in,
who had sneaked in to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, in
order to bring us into bondage. But we did not yield in subjection to them for
even an hour, so that the truth of the gospel would remain with you. But from
those who were of high reputation (what they were makes no difference to me;
God shows no partiality)—well, those who were of reputation contributed nothing
to me.” (Galatians 2:4-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul had previously straightened out Peter at Antioch
before the council of Jerusalem. The Book of Acts records Peter’s comments at
the Jerusalem council private session. Paul referred to his own labors among
the Galatian believers. Paul referred to an infirmity in the flesh that was
accepted by the Galatian believers. Gal. 2:12-21; Gal. 4:11; Gal. 4:14-15. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For prior to the coming of certain men from James, he used to
eat with the Gentiles; but when they came, he began to withdraw and hold
himself aloof, fearing the party of the circumcision.” (Galatians 2:12, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“But when I saw that they were not straightforward about the
truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in the presence of all, &quot;If you,
being a Jew, live like the Gentiles and not like the Jews, how is it that you
compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?” (Galatians 2:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For through the Law I died to the Law, so that I might
live to God. &quot;I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who
live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live
by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.”
(Galatians 2:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“I fear for you, that perhaps I have labored over you in vain.”
(Galatians 4:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and that which was a trial to you in my bodily condition you
did not despise or loathe, but you received me as an angel of God, as Christ
Jesus Himself. Where then is that sense of blessing you had? For I bear you
witness that, if possible, you would have plucked out your eyes and given them
to me.” (Galatians 4:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul had a very great concern for the maturity of the
Galatian believers. Paul wrote Galatians with his own hand. Paul personally
bore the marks in his body of his faith and ministry. Gal. 4:19-20; Gal. 6:11; Gal.
6:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“My children, with whom I am again in labor until Christ is
formed in you— but I could wish to be present with you now and to change my
tone, for I am perplexed about you.” (Galatians 4:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“See with what large letters I am writing to you with my own
hand.” (Galatians 6:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“From now on let no one cause trouble for me, for I bear on my
body the brand-marks of Jesus.” (Galatians 6:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Ephesians </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul referred to himself as a prisoner of Jesus Christ
for the Gentilesand being made a minister by grace. Eph. 3:1; Eph. 3:7. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the
sake of you Gentiles—” (Ephesians 3:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“of which I was made a minister, according to the gift of God's
grace which was given to me according to the working of His power.” (Ephesians
3:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul referred to himself as the “least of all saints.”
Paul also referred to himself as commissioned to preach to the Gentiles. Paul
prayed for the Ephesian congregation for maturity. Eph. 3:8; Eph. 3:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“To me, the very least of all saints, this grace was given, to
preach to the Gentiles the unfathomable riches of Christ,” (Ephesians 3:8,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason I bow my knees before the Father,” (Ephesians
3:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Philippians</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul included Timothy as one with him in sending the
message of Philippians to the church at Philippi. Paul referred to his bonds or
imprisonment and his longing after the Philippian believers. Phil. 1:1; Phil.
1:7; Phil. 1:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus, To all the
saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, including the overseers and
deacons:” (Philippians 1:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For it is only right for me to feel this way about you all,
because I have you in my heart, since both in my imprisonment and in the
defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of grace with
me.” (Philippians 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For God is my witness, how I long for you all with the
affection of Christ Jesus.” (Philippians 1:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul spoke of a desire to leave this life, but also of
the knowledge that to stay in this life was more needful. Paul planned to send
Timothy to the Philippian church to determine their condition and bring the
news to Paul. Phil. 1:23-24; Phil. 2:19-20. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But I am hard-pressed from both directions, having the desire
to depart and be with Christ, for that is very much better; yet to remain on in
the flesh is more necessary for your sake.” (Philippians 1:23-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly,
so that I also may be encouraged when I learn of your condition. For I have no
one else of kindred spirit who will genuinely be concerned for your welfare.”
(Philippians 2:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul sent Epaphroditus to the Philippian church. Paul
referred to his background activities as circumcised the eighth day of the
tribe of Benjamin, Hebrew of the Hebrews, a Pharisee, persecuting the churches,
and blameless in carrying out the mechanics of the law. Phil. 2:25-30; Phil.
3:5-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my
brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger and
minister to my need; because he was longing for you all and was distressed
because you had heard that he was sick.” (Philippians 2:25-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“because he came close to death for the work of Christ, risking
his life to complete what was deficient in your service to me.” (Philippians
2:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“circumcised the eighth day, of the nation of Israel, of the
tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as to the Law, a Pharisee; as to zeal,
a persecutor of the church; as to the righteousness which is in the Law, found
blameless.” (Philippians 3:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul referred to himself as the example for the
Philippians to follow. Paul sent a personal admonition to Euodia and Syntyche
to be of the same mind in the Lord. Paul stated that no church had helped him
financially at the outset of his ministry except the Philippian church. Phil.
3:17; Phil. 4:2; Phil. 4:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Brethren, join in following my example, and observe those who
walk according to the pattern you have in us.” (Philippians 3:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“I urge Euodia and I urge Syntyche to live in harmony in the
Lord.” (Philippians 4:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“You yourselves also know, Philippians, that at the first
preaching of the gospel, after I left Macedonia, no church shared with me in
the matter of giving and receiving but you alone;” (Philippians 4:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul stated that the Philippians had supported him twice
while he was ministering at Thessalonica. Paul referred to having received from
Epaphroditus, their “offering,” the things from them. In closing the epistle,
Paul referred to greetings being sent to the Philippian believers by Caesar’s
household, apparently inferring that Paul had gained converts from that sphere
of notables. Phil. 4:16; Phil. 4:18; Phil. 4:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“for even in Thessalonica you sent a gift more than once for my
needs.” (Philippians 4:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But I have received everything in full and have an abundance;
I am amply supplied, having received from Epaphroditus what you have sent, a
fragrant aroma, an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to God.” (Philippians
4:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“All the saints greet you, especially those of Caesar's
household.” (Philippians 4:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Colossians </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul stated that the Colossians had been ministered to by
Epaphras, their faithful minister in Christ. Paul referred to communication he
had received from Epaphras concerning the believers at Colossae. Col. 1:7; Col.
1:8. </p>

<p class=Verses>“just as you learned it from Epaphras, our beloved fellow
bond-servant, who is a faithful servant of Christ on our behalf,” (Colossians
1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and he also informed us of your love in the Spirit.”
(Colossians 1:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul stated that he has a great conflict in his soul
concerning the people at the Colossian church, the church at Laodicea, and
other places where he had not been able to minister personally. Col. 2:1-3. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For I want you to know how great a struggle I have on your
behalf and for those who are at Laodicea, and for all those who have not
personally seen my face, that their hearts may be encouraged, having been knit
together in love, and attaining to all the wealth that comes from the full
assurance of understanding, resulting in a true knowledge of God's mystery,
that is, Christ Himself, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and
knowledge.” (Colossians 2:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul sent Tychicus to inform the Colossians about the
welfare of Paul and to find out for Paul their spiritual condition, encourage
them, then bring word back to Paul. Col. 4:7-8. </p>

<p class=Verses>“As to all my affairs, Tychicus, our beloved brother and
faithful servant and fellow bond-servant in the Lord, will bring you
information. For I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may
know about our circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts;”
(Colossians 4:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul referred to sending Onesimus along to help clarify
what all had transpired at Colossae. Paul referred to Aristarchus as being a
fellow prisoner there with him. Paul referred to Marcus as a nephew of
Barnabas. Col. 4:9; Col. 4:10. </p>

<p class=Verses>“and with him Onesimus, our faithful and beloved brother, who
is one of your number. They will inform you about the whole situation here.”
(Colossians 4:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, sends you his greetings; and
also Barnabas's cousin Mark (about whom you received instructions; if he comes
to you, welcome him);” (Colossians 4:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul referred to Epaphras in such a way as to indicate
that he was away from the church at Colossae and a prisoner there with Paul.
Paul referred to Epaphras as having a zeal for Colossae, Laodicea, and
Hierapolis. Col. 4:12; Col. 4:13. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Epaphras, who is one of your number, a bondslave of Jesus
Christ, sends you his greetings, always laboring earnestly for you in his
prayers, that you may stand perfect and fully assured in all the will of God.”
(Colossians 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For I testify for him that he has a deep concern for you and
for those who are in Laodicea and Hierapolis.” (Colossians 4:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul referred to Luke and Demas as sending greetings to
Colossian believers. Paul referred to the reading of the epistle of Colossians
to the Laodicean believers and vice versa. Paul referred to Archippus in a
personal exhortation to stay with it. Col. 4:14; Col. 4:16; Col. 4:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Luke, the beloved physician, sends you his greetings, and also
Demas.” (Colossians 4:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“When this letter is read among you, have it also read in the
church of the Laodiceans; and you, for your part read my letter that is coming
from Laodicea.” (Colossians 4:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Say to Archippus, &quot;Take heed to the ministry which you
have received in the Lord, that you may fulfill it.&quot;” (Colossians 4:17,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>1 Thessalonians </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When Paul addressed the Thessalonian believers, he
included Silvanus and Timotheus. Paul referred to being shamefully treated at
Philippi but this didn’t affect his boldness at Thessalonica. 1 Thess. 1:1; 1
Thess. 2:1-2. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Paul and Silvanus and Timothy, To the church of the
Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and
peace.” (1 Thessalonians 1:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For you yourselves know, brethren, that our coming to you was
not in vain, but after we had already suffered and been mistreated in Philippi,
as you know, we had the boldness in our God to speak to you the gospel of God
amid much opposition.” (1 Thessalonians 2:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul was careful to clarify the type of ministry at
Thessalonica. It was not deceitful, not with flattering words, not with a cloak
of covetousness, and not seeking glory. Paul clarified the positive side of his
ministry to the Thessalonians. He was as a nurse day and night, he conducted
himself justly and without blame, he exhorted, comforted, charged, and acted as
a father to them. 1 Thess. 2:3-8; 1 Thess. 2:9-11. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For our exhortation does not come from error or impurity or by
way of deceit; but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with
the gospel, so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God who examines our hearts.”
(1 Thessalonians 2:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Having so fond an affection for you, we were well-pleased to
impart to you not only the gospel of God but also our own lives, because you
had become very dear to us.” (1 Thessalonians 2:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For you recall, brethren, our labor and hardship, how working
night and day so as not to be a burden to any of you, we proclaimed to you the
gospel of God. You are witnesses, and so is God, how devoutly and uprightly and
blamelessly we behaved toward you believers; just as you know how we were
exhorting and encouraging and imploring each one of you as a father would his
own children,” (1 Thessalonians 2:9-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul referred to the Thessalonian church as becoming
imitators of the Judean churches and having suffered persecution. Paul referred
to his desire to minister to them in person again but he had been hindered and
delayed. 1 Thess. 2:14; 1 Thess. 2:17-18. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For you, brethren, became imitators of the churches of God in
Christ Jesus that are in Judea, for you also endured the same sufferings at the
hands of your own countrymen, even as they did from the Jews,” (1 Thessalonians
2:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But we, brethren, having been taken away from you for a short
while—in person, not in spirit—were all the more eager with great desire to see
your face. For we wanted to come to you—I, Paul, more than once—and yet Satan
hindered us.” (1 Thessalonians 2:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul sent Timothy, both being at Athens, to the
Thessalonian church to minister to them. Paul referred to his personal teaching
of the undeserved suffering concept to the Thessalonian believers when he was
with them. Paul referred to the fact that the Thessalonian believers had the
undeserved suffering that he had predicted. 1 Thess. 3:4. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For indeed when we were with you, we kept telling you in
advance that we were going to suffer affliction; and so it came to pass, as you
know.” (1 Thessalonians 3:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul referred to the fact that Timothy had returned with
the message that the Thessalonian believers still had a positive attitude toward
Paul. Paul referred to his personal prayer life for the Thessalonian believers
to go on to maturity. 1 Thess. 3:6-9; 1 Thess. 3:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But now that Timothy has come to us from you, and has brought
us good news of your faith and love, and that you always think kindly of us,
longing to see us just as we also long to see you,” (1 Thessalonians 3:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“for this reason, brethren, in all our distress and affliction
we were comforted about you through your faith; for now we really live, if you
stand firm in the Lord. For what thanks can we render to God for you in return
for all the joy with which we rejoice before our God on your account,” (1
Thessalonians 3:7-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“as we night and day keep praying most earnestly that we may
see your face, and may complete what is lacking in your faith?” (1
Thessalonians 3:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>2 Thessalonians</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul addressed the Thessalonian believers again with
Timothy and Silvanus along with him in writing to them. Paul commanded the
Thessalonian believers to be not shaken in mind or troubled by spirit, word, or
letter because they were not in the Tribulation although having pressure. 2
Thess. 1:1; 2 Thess. 2:1-2. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Paul and Silvanus and Timothy, To the church of the
Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:” (2 Thessalonians
1:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now we request you, brethren, with regard to the coming of our
Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him, that you not be quickly
shaken from your composure or be disturbed either by a spirit or a message or a
letter as if from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has come.” (2
Thessalonians 2:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul commanded them to stand fast and hold to the
traditions which he had taught in person or from his epistle. Paul commanded
them to withdraw themselves from every brother that walks disorderly. 2 Thess.
2:15-16; 2 Thess. 3:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So then, brethren, stand firm and hold to the traditions which
you were taught, whether by word of mouth or by letter from us. Now may our
Lord Jesus Christ Himself and God our Father, who has loved us and given us
eternal comfort and good hope by grace,” (2 Thessalonians 2:15-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ, that you keep away from every brother who leads an unruly life and not
according to the tradition which you received from us.” (2 Thessalonians 3:6,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul stated that at no time did he walk disorderly among
them. Paul stated that at no time was he lazy, but worked day and night to not
be chargeable to them. He supported himself, not taking support from them. 2
Thess. 3:7; 2 Thess. 3:8. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example,
because we did not act in an undisciplined manner among you,” (2 Thessalonians
3:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“nor did we eat anyone's bread without paying for it, but with
labor and hardship we kept working night and day so that we would not be a
burden to any of you;” (2 Thessalonians 3:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul had heard that there were busybodies in the
Thessalonian church. A busybody in Greek is one who bustles about uselessly, to
busy one’s self about trifling, needless, useless matters. A person officiously
inquisitive about other’s affairs. 2 Thess. 3:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For we hear that some among you are leading an undisciplined
life, doing no work at all, but acting like busybodies.” (2 Thessalonians 3:11,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul commanded the busybodies to get with it in the field
of real work and to be quiet. Paul commanded that other believers note the
troublemakers and if they don’t shape up, to have no company with them. Paul
referred to having written the epistle of 2 Thessalonians with his own hand. 2
Thess. 3:12; 2 Thess. 3:14; 2 Thess. 3:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now such persons we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus
Christ to work in quiet fashion and eat their own bread.” (2 Thessalonians
3:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“If anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter, take
special note of that person and do not associate with him, so that he will be
put to shame.” (2 Thessalonians 3:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand, and this is a
distinguishing mark in every letter; this is the way I write.” (2 Thessalonians
3:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>1 Timothy</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul referred to Timothy as his son in the faith. However,
he was not speaking as Timothy’s “spiritual father.” Paul related later that
Timothy had known the Scriptures from childhood. Paul referred to leaving
Timothy to stay at Ephesus when he went into Macedonia. 1 Tim. 1:1; 1 Tim. 1:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment
of God our Savior, and of Christ Jesus, who is our hope,” (1 Timothy 1:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“As I urged you upon my departure for Macedonia, remain on at
Ephesus so that you may instruct certain men not to teach strange doctrines,”
(1 Timothy 1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul referred to the expression of his own apostolic gift
functioning in delivering over to Satan, Hymenaeus and Alexander, so they would
learn not to blaspheme. At the writing to Timothy of the Book of 1 Timothy, Paul
hoped to come to Timothy shortly. 1 Tim. 1:20; 1 Tim. 3:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed
over to Satan, so that they will be taught not to blaspheme.” (1 Timothy 1:20,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“I am writing these things to you, hoping to come to you before
long;” (1 Timothy 3:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>2 Timothy </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul prayed for Timothy day and night. Paul greatly
desired to see Timothy. Paul referred that all those in Asia had turned away
from him. He mentioned Phygelus and Hermogenes. Paul referred to having been
refreshed often by one Onesiphorus. 2 Tim. 1:3; 2 Tim. 1:4; 2 Tim. 1:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I thank God, whom I serve with a clear conscience the way my
forefathers did, as I constantly remember you in my prayers night and day,” (2
Timothy 1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“longing to see you, even as I recall your tears, so that I may
be filled with joy.” (2 Timothy 1:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“You are aware of the fact that all who are in Asia turned away
from me, among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.” (2 Timothy 1:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Onesiphorus had sought Paul out in Rome and found him.
Paul referred to the fact that Onesiphorus had ministered to Paul in many
things while Paul was at Ephesus, as Timothy well knew. Paul referred to
Hymenaeus and Philetus as those who express “worldly and empty chatter” and
whose talk would “spread like gangrene.” 2 Tim. 2:16-18. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But avoid worldly and empty chatter, for it will lead to
further ungodliness, and their talk will spread like gangrene. Among them are
Hymenaeus and Philetus, men who have gone astray from the truth saying that the
resurrection has already taken place, and they upset the faith of some.” (2
Timothy 2:16-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul referred to persecutions which came to him at
Antioch, Iconium, at Lystra. Paul referred to himself as having fought a good
fight, finished his course and kept the faith. Paul referred to Demas
abandoning him and departing into Thessalonica. Paul referred to Crescens
leaving Paul and going to Galatia. Paul referred to Titus leaving and going to
Dalmatia. 2 Tim. 3:11; 2 Tim. 4:7; 2 Tim. 4:10. </p>

<p class=Verses>“persecutions, and sufferings, such as happened to me at
Antioch, at Iconium and at Lystra; what persecutions I endured, and out of them
all the Lord rescued me!” (2 Timothy 3:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I
have kept the faith;” (2 Timothy 4:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“for Demas, having loved this present world, has deserted me
and gone to Thessalonica; Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.” (2
Timothy 4:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul referred to Luke as being with him there in Rome.
Paul referred to having sent Tychicus to Ephesus and in the previous verse
referred to Timothy coming to Rome and bringing Mark with him. Paul referred to
items that Timothy was supposed to bring when he came to Rome. They were to
bring him a cloak, bocks and parchments. Paul stated that Alexander the
coppersmith did him much damage. 2 Tim. 4:11-14. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Only Luke is with me. Pick up Mark and bring him with you, for
he is useful to me for service. But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus. When you
come bring the cloak which I left at Troas with Carpus, and the books,
especially the parchments. Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm; the Lord
will repay him according to his deeds.” (2 Timothy 4:11-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Timothy 4:16, Paul was alone in his first defense, as
all men had forsaken him. Paul referred to Erastus abiding at Corinth. Paul
referred to leaving Trophimus sick at Miletus. Paul’s letter to Timothy from
Rome included greetings from Eubulus, Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and the brethren.
2 Tim. 4:20-21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“At my first defense no one supported me, but all deserted me;
may it not be counted against them.” (2 Timothy 4:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Erastus remained at Corinth, but Trophimus I left sick at
Miletus. Make every effort to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, also
Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brethren.” (2 Timothy 4:20-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Titus </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul had left Titus at Crete to recognize the spiritual
communication and leadership gifts on the island of Crete and in every city to
finish the work. Paul referred to sending Artemas or Tychicus to Titus on Crete
and at that time Titus was to come to Rome to Paul. When Titus was able to come
to Rome, he was to bring a lawyer, Zenas and also Apollos with him. Titus 1:5;
Titus 3:12-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason I left you in Crete, that you would set in
order what remains and appoint elders in every city as I directed you,” (Titus
1:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, make every effort to
come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.
Diligently help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way so that nothing is
lacking for them.” (Titus 3:12-13, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Philemon </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul referred to himself as a prisoner and includes
Timothy in the greeting to Philemon. Paul referred to Archippus as a fellow
soldier. Paul referred to himself as one who was old or aged. Philemon 1:1-2; Philemon
1:9. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To
Philemon our beloved brother and fellow worker, and to Apphia our sister, and
to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:” (Philemon
