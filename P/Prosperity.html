<h2>Prosperity</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Types of Prosperity</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The major forms of prosperity include doctrinal
prosperity, material prosperity, social prosperity, physical prosperity, and
family prosperity. Each are discussed briefly below.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Doctrinal Prosperity</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As you mature spiritually, your biggest occupational
hazard will be blind spots where you are not applying doctrine. The more a
believer advances spiritually, the more the potential they have of falling flat
on their face because of an increased number of blind spots. Matt. 6:33; 2 Cor.
4:16; Mark 8:34-38; Eph. 4:11-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and
all these things will be added to you.” (Matthew 6:33, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore we do not lose heart, but though our outer man is
decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day.” (2 Corinthians 4:16,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He summoned the crowd with His disciples, and said to
them, &quot;If anyone wishes to come after Me, he must deny himself, and take
up his cross and follow Me. &quot;For whoever wishes to save his life will lose
it, but whoever loses his life for My sake and the gospel's will save it.
&quot;For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world, and forfeit his
soul? &quot;For what will a man give in exchange for his soul? &quot;For
whoever is ashamed of Me and My words in this adulterous and sinful generation,
the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when He comes in the glory of His
Father with the holy angels.&quot;” (Mark 8:34-38, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some
as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the
saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ; until
we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of
God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the
fullness of Christ.” (Ephesians 4:11-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is imperative to keep application of Bible doctrine up
with the intake of Bible doctrine. If not, then you get lazy and you become
naive. Then, you let your guard down and begin to trust in your human abilities
only. Beware of the people who come up on your spiritual blind side. Someone
you meet may appear to be sweet, nice, lovely, and personable. They may be very
persuasive in what they say. Many will mistakenly assume that sweetness is
spirituality and bluntness is carnality and thus we become naive.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An Old Testament example is Gedaliah who could not handle
prosperity. They had had many days of happiness with no trials or troubles. This
was a case of having everybody being nice can wipe you out. There will be more
on Gedaliah below. Jer. 40:9; Jer. 40:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, swore to
them and to their men, saying, &quot;Do not be afraid of serving the Chaldeans;
stay in the land and serve the king of Babylon, that it may go well with you.”
(Jeremiah 40:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and said to him, &quot;Are you well aware that Baalis the king
of the sons of Ammon has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your
life?&quot; But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam did not believe them.” (Jeremiah
40:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Another Old Testament example is David who passed the
prosperity test and passed the spiritual maturity test. David wanted some water
while in the cave at Adullam, so three of his men went out behind enemy lines
to get some for him. Upon their return at great risk, David poured the water on
the ground because when he saw that they loved him so much they would risk
their lives to get him a drink of water, he knew that if he drank the water, he
would not order these men into battle or give them dangerous assignments. Drinking
the water would weaken David as a military leader and render him unfair and
unfit as a field commander. 2 Sam. 23:15-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“David had a craving and said, &quot;Oh that someone would give
me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem which is by the gate!&quot; So the
three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines, and drew water from
the well of Bethlehem which was by the gate, and took it and brought it to
David. Nevertheless he would not drink it, but poured it out to the LORD; and
he said, &quot;Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this. Shall I drink
the blood of the men who went in jeopardy of their lives?&quot; Therefore he
would not drink it. These things the three mighty men did.” (2 Samuel 23:15-17,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In his maturity, David poured the water on the ground so
he could rotate his men objectively and without bias into the tough
assignments. He knew that in the future, he may have to send some of these men
to their death at one time or another. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If he had drank the water, in future days he would likely
cater to the ones who brought the water to him and he would be unfair and
preferential. It is terrible to have emotional leadership in any area
especially in an age of apostacy. Decisions must be made constantly and
accurately and then move on.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Material Prosperity</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Material prosperity is the ruination of many. Good material
prosperity is handled within the believer’s spiritual life. Matt. 6:33; Prov.
3:9-10; Eccl. 5:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and
all these things will be added to you.” (Matthew 6:33, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Honor the LORD from your wealth And from the first of all your
produce; So your barns will be filled with plenty And your vats will overflow
with new wine.” (Proverbs 3:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Furthermore, as for every man to whom God has given riches and
wealth, He has also empowered him to eat from them and to receive his reward
and rejoice in his labor; this is the gift of God.” (Ecclesiastes 5:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Material prosperity can lead some to join others who have
evil intent and plans as described by Solomon to his son in Proverbs 1. The
warning is to not let prosperity and fame entice you into running with evil
types. It will not end well for you.  Prov. 1:10-11; Prov. 1:15-16; Prov. 1:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“My son, if sinners entice you, Do not consent. If they say,
&quot;Come with us, Let us lie in wait for blood, Let us ambush the innocent
without cause;” (Proverbs 1:10-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“My son, do not walk in the way with them. Keep your feet from
their path, For their feet run to evil And they hasten to shed blood.”
(Proverbs 1:15-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But they lie in wait for their own blood; They ambush their
own lives.” (Proverbs 1:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When you depend on the material details of life for your
security, this is a false security. You have failed the prosperity test. Eccl.
5:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor he
who loves abundance with its income. This too is vanity.” (Ecclesiastes 5:10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Working for a living is a good thing. Living without
working is no good. Eccl. 5:12; Prov. 13:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The sleep of the working man is pleasant, whether he eats
little or much; but the full stomach of the rich man does not allow him to
sleep.” (Ecclesiastes 5:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The soul of the sluggard craves and gets nothing, But the soul
of the diligent is made fat.” (Proverbs 13:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Social Prosperity</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We can see many examples of those who have gained social
prosperity in academic circles, athletic circles, in the local society, and
even where you work. An example of handling social prosperity very well is our
Lord Jesus Christ as He was growing up. Luke 2:40; Luke 2:51-52.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The Child continued to grow and become strong, increasing in
wisdom; and the grace of God was upon Him.” (Luke 2:40, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and He
continued in subjection to them; and His mother treasured all these things in
her heart. And Jesus kept increasing in wisdom and stature, and in favor with
God and men.” (Luke 2:51-52, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Many believers do not handle social prosperity very well or
are naïve and do not yet have the spiritual discernment regarding those with
whom they associate. If you have many friends only because you have a lot of
money, then they may not really your friends. If you have many friends simply because
you seem to be smart, popular and desirable to be around, they may not really
your friends. Another example of not handling social prosperity very well is
telling everyone that when you get a scholarship or an award for some
accomplishment, you are the first to tell everyone about it. Then people tell
you that you are really something and you are stupid enough to believe it all. The
desire to be told that you are great (approbation lust) is as addicting as
liquor. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Physical Prosperity</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Physical prosperity or good health for the believer is
one of God's blessings in the spiritual life.    In contrast is the perpetually
carnal believer or the reversionistic believer where they may eventually have a
loss of health or even ultimately the sin unto death as the most severe divine
discipline possible. 3 John 1:2; Prov. 3:8; 1 Cor. 11:30.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Beloved, I pray that in all respects you may prosper and be in
good health, just as your soul prospers.” (3 John 1:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“It will be healing to your body And refreshment to your
bones.” (Proverbs 3:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason many among you are weak and sick, and a number
sleep.” (1 Corinthians 11:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Family Prosperity</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Family prosperity is living a long life as part of God's grace
blessing in the spiritual life. This is attributed to growing spiritually, the
function of your spiritual gift, your grace orientation to God's plan for your
life, and honoring your father and mother. Exodus 20:6; Exodus 20:12.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“but showing lovingkindness to thousands, to those who love Me
and keep My commandments.” (Exodus 20:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be
prolonged in the land which the LORD your God gives you.” (Exodus 20:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Watch out for prosperity. Psalms 73:3-7 contains a
general warning to be careful in the prosperity testing and not lose focus on God's
provision of grace resources and blessings for you.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For I was envious of the arrogant As I saw the prosperity of
the wicked. For there are no pains in their death, And their body is fat. They
are not in trouble as other men, Nor are they plagued like mankind. Therefore
pride is their necklace; The garment of violence covers them. Their eye bulges
from fatness; The imaginations of their heart run riot.” (Psalms 73:3-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Naivete of Gedeliah</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Gedeliah was a man in whom there was no guile, like
Nathaniel. His honesty and forthrightness in responding to Jeremiah’s ministry
reveals something of his character. Ishmael was going to assassinate Gedeliah. 
Gedeliah made the mistake of assuming that everyone was like himself, open, and
above board. People often make this mistake. All people are different and
different in many ways. You cannot judge people by your own life. Jer. 39 - 40.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Those who have no guile find it very difficult to assume
guile in others. It never occurred to Gedeliah that Jews would return to the Land
for any but the highest motives of patriotism. The only protection that
Gedeliah had was in the knowledge that everyone has an old sin nature. It is
very easy to understand that your enemies have one, but you must understand
that everyone has an old sin nature. Jer. 17:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Thus says the LORD, &quot;Cursed is the man who trusts in
mankind And makes flesh his strength, And whose heart turns away from the
LORD.” (Jeremiah 17:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Furthermore, the happiness interlude had deceived
Gedeliah into a position of watering down Bible doctrine. Gedeliah felt that
Bible doctrine wasn’t needed anymore because he had already learned enough
doctrine. There was no pressure and all was well in his prosperity, so he invariably
made other things in life a higher priority. Getting away from the consistent
intake of Bible doctrine means that you are in some form of emotional revolt. You
have become negative and your emotions and your old sin nature are controlling your
soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Inevitably, prosperity can leave you feeling that you can
be close friends with everyone regardless of who they are and trust everyone
regardless of the danger they pose. Gedeliah fell into that trap. Gedeliah had
forgotten that those who had returned from Ammon, Moab, and Edom were not the
Bible class crowd and some were not even believers. Some were apostates.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Leadership demands discernment. No one can stay in
leadership without being discerning. The way to start being discerning is to
assume the worst in everyone and let their behavior and integrity cause your
estimation of them to improve. Leadership demands that you must assume the
worst about everyone. This is not only protection for the leader but for the
ones they lead. This is so true in the military. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Everyone has an old sin nature: nice people, nasty
people, fat people, slim people, red heads, blue heads, knot heads and what
have you. Gedeliah had lost his sharpness. Leadership must depend upon doctrine
in the soul. Gedeliah’s naivete resulted in his own tragic death and civil war
in the Land. He had a mild emotional revolt contrasted with a strong emotional
revolt. A mild emotional revolt loves all the brethren, is altruistic,
sentimental, and does not react to anything but responds to everything. With
arms wide open, he welcomed Ishmael who killed him. People must respond to a
leader, but the leader cannot respond back.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Why Do the Wicked Prosper?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jeremiah 12:1 involves the Anathoth conspiracy. There was
a conspiracy where the plotters, the dupes, and the violent types were
comprised of Jeremiah’s friends, family and his wife. These conspirators were
having a ball. They ate well, slept well, played well, and worked well. They were
succeeding and there sat Jeremiah with Bible doctrine and was up to his
eyeballs in trials. Jer. 11:21-23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Righteous are You, O LORD, that I would plead my case with
You; Indeed I would discuss matters of justice with You: Why has the way of the
wicked prospered? Why are all those who deal in treachery at ease?”  (Jeremiah
12:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the men of Anathoth,
who seek your life, saying, “Do not prophesy in the name of the LORD, so that
you will not die at our hand”; therefore, thus says the LORD of hosts, “Behold,
I am about to punish them! The young men will die by the sword, their sons and
daughters will die by famine; and a remnant will not be left to them, for I
will bring disaster on the men of Anathoth—the year of their punishment.”“ 
(Jeremiah 11:21-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The conspirators were having the best of it. They were
happy. They were prospering. In Jeremiah 12:2-3, “You are near to their lips”
means they talked about God and they were hustling to serve Him, but they were
in emotional revolt and God was “far from their mind.” Thus, Jeremiah was under
great pressure and he was having a mild emotional revolt himself. He was mildly
depressed. This was depression caused by people, pressure, details of life,
physiological change, mental illness, loneliness, and boredom.</p>

<p class=Verses>“You have planted them, they have also taken root; They grow,
they have even produced fruit. You are near to their lips But far from their
mind. But You know me, O LORD; You see me; And You examine my heart’s attitude
toward You. Drag them off like sheep for the slaughter And set them apart for a
day of carnage!”  (Jeremiah 12:2-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Jeremiah 12:1, God’s character is in view. “Righteous”
is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>צדּיק</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(tsaddı̂yq) and was
used originally for an objective king who was very fair and defended right
causes. This is exactly what Jeremiah was saying: “Look, God, you defend
righteous causes, You are always fair, O Lord, so why do these jerks prosper, why
are they allowed to plot against me and also to prosper at the same time?”</p>

<p class=Verses>“Righteous are You, O LORD, that I would plead my case with
You; Indeed I would discuss matters of justice with You: Why has the way of the
wicked prospered? Why are all those who deal in treachery at ease?” (Jeremiah
12:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jeremiah understood the essence of God and probably you
do too. With all of these characteristics, how can God allow anybody who is
wicked to be happy a minute? In Jeremiah 12:1, “plead my case” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>ריב</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(rı̂yb) and means; “I would (and I do)
complain to you, You are fair Lord, but I’m complaining.” Have you ever been in
that place? This is typical of a person who is temporarily disoriented to
grace.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You see, the wicked person apparently is having a ball.
Therefore, you think; “Lord, why don’t you clobber this person, instead, I’m
the one getting clobbered?” Of course, the answer is simple. They are using
their prosperity for their own ends instead of getting Bible doctrine. However,
they will be clobbered without remedy when the fifth cycle of discipline hits
them.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Jeremiah 12:1, “indeed” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>אך</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>('ak) and is like our English word “yuk.” “I would
discuss matters of justice with You” is the piel imperfect of <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>דּבר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(dâbar) and means “I will talk
intensively with you of justice.” Justice is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>משׁפּט</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(mishpâṭ) and means a verdict (favorable
or unfavorable) pronounced judicially, especially a sentence or formal decree of
divine law. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jeremiah was upset and wanted to convince God of his
preferred approach (human viewpoint) to justice. Jeremiah was saying, “God, You
are fair, but we need to talk about justice because God, even though You are
always perfectly fair, You aren’t handling this right and You need me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Notice that Jeremiah had doctrine. He understood the
essence of God, but he wasn’t applying it because he was in emotional revolt.
Jeremiah was bucking the tiger. He was complaining to God. What was Jeremiah’s
true motive? He was actually trying to twist doctrine to somehow justify his
plan of revenge. Revenge is never justified. God was never going to bend His perfect
and absolute character to satisfy Jeremiah’s thirst for revenge.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Remember that God is not your servant. He never bends His
character to do you a favor. So, Jeremiah is actually saying, “God, you are
always fair, but you are unfair here.” He is looking at the conspirators rather
than at the Lord. “God, you are not doing it my way, they have been unkind to
me Lord, so make them miserable.” Under temporary or permanent emotional
revolt, no Bible doctrine can be correctly applied. He knew true doctrine, but
applied it incorrectly.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The big question of Jeremiah. 12:1 is; “Why has the way
of the wicked prospered?” This is an interrogative of confusion. “Wicked” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>רשׁע</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(râshâ‛) and refers to the conspirators
in Anathoth. These conspirators include Jeremiah’s wife, his immediate family
and kinsmen, and his friends. They are prospering. However, the prosperity of
the wicked helps clarify the issue of God’s grace.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Because of God’s laws and His gracious communication of
them, the wicked conspirators of Anathoth were in a time of prosperity. Their
prosperity is a reminder of the grace of God. By rejecting Bible doctrine,
these wicked were rejecting the basis of their own prosperity. Therefore, they
not only lost their prosperity, but their freedom, their privacy and the goose
that laid the golden egg, i.e., private enterprise.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They went into soul slavery which is emotional revolt and
then into physical slavery under the fifth cycle of discipline. Therefore, the
prosperity of the wicked is the righteousness and justice of God in keeping His
Word and abiding by principles of prosperity which were observed in the reign
of King Josiah.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The wicked are free to abuse their freedom. They would do
so in the practice of the phallic cult which would rob the nation of its
spiritual heritage. Therefore, the next verse deals with God’s justice and God’s
fairness.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In time, the stable unbeliever is better off than the
unstable believer, but not in eternity. The unstable believer has rejected
doctrine and suffers from scar tissue, emotional revolt and sublimation and
then eventually the sin unto death. However, the stable unbeliever observed the
Divine Institutions, has common sense, enjoys his right woman, functions under
basic morality for establishing freedom. Therefore, the unbeliever often
prospers in time, while the believer is miserable, like Jeremiah.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This principle applies to unbelievers who stay out of
false doctrine. As long as the unbeliever retains their common sense, they are going
to have a certain amount of happiness. 2 Peter 2:17-22; Eccl. 9:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“These are springs without water and mists driven by a storm,
for whom the black darkness has been reserved. For speaking out arrogant words
of vanity they entice by fleshly desires, by sensuality, those who barely
escape from the ones who live in error, promising them freedom while they
themselves are slaves of corruption; for by what a man is overcome, by this he
is enslaved. For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world by
the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in
them and are overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first.
For it would be better for them not to have known the way of righteousness,
than having known it, to turn away from the holy commandment handed on to them.
It has happened to them according to the true proverb, &quot;A DOG RETURNS TO
ITS OWN VOMIT,&quot; and, &quot;A sow, after washing, returns to wallowing in
the mire.&quot;” (2 Peter 2:17-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Enjoy life with the woman whom you love all the days of your
fleeting life which He has given to you under the sun; for this is your reward
in life and in your toil in which you have labored under the sun.”
(Ecclesiastes 9:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At this point in Jeremiah’s ministry, he was suffering
from temporary emotional revolt. At this time, we still see the repercussions
of Josiah’s policy. Under Josiah, the Mosaic Law was put into operation and
observed. The prosperity of the nation came from that policy. The result was a
temporary and superficial prosperity, which would soon be destroyed by national
degeneracy. The wicked conspirators against Jeremiah were still enjoying the
benefits of freedom and prosperity and they appeared to be happy.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A corrected translation of Jeremiah 12:1 is; “Righteous
and only righteous, you O Lord. If I complain to you only this once, I will
talk to you of judgments. Why, does the way of the wicked prosper? All who are
treacherous prosper.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Why are all those who deal in treachery at ease?” This
means all who are treacherous, keep on being treacherous. This is very
emphatic. They are treacherous in their actions. They are treacherous in their
character. They simply follow through from character. “All who are treacherous
in character and action enjoy (qal imperfect) prosperity.” At this time, they
are enjoying prosperity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Conclusion</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Certain, functions, principles, and concepts exist in a
national entity because of the Laws of Divine Establishment that includes laws
of free enterprise. These principles bring prosperity to believers and
unbelievers, the good people, the bad people, the ones with their edification
complex of the soul, and the apostates.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Morality and freedom taught by the ten commandments is
the basic system for all human freedom. Where human freedom exists, free
enterprise exists. Where free enterprise exists all kinds of people will
prosper. The reason some of you are prosperous is because some of the worst
wicked men in America are prosperous. That is free enterprise. God is fair. The
rain falls on the just and the unjust.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Under Josiah, the Mosaic Law was discovered in the
temple. The Josiah policy became the Mosaic Law. The result was freedom,
privacy, and free enterprise. Under those conditions, the wicked as well as the
righteous prospered. However, the prosperity of the wicked would disappear when
freedom, privacy and free enterprise are destroyed. These conspirators actually
destroyed the very thing that had made them great.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jeremiah was disturbed about the prosperity of the
wicked, however, their just due was coming. Apostacy would neutralize the
Mosaic Law and the conditions described by Jeremiah would disappear in the
reign of Zedekiah.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They rejected Bible doctrine, then they sawed off the
limb that made them prosperous. Finally, they were hit. The wicked were free to
abuse their freedom because of volition. This same freedom and prosperity would
destroy them. </p>
