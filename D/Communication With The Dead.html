<h2>Communication With The Dead</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Is communication with the dead possible? The biblical
answer is definitely no! It is not possible to contact the dead. The spirit of
departed dead cannot communicate or return to fellowship with living loved
ones. There was one exception where God permitted Samuel to come back and tell
Saul how he would die the sin unto death. 2 Sam. 12:23; Luke 16:27-31.</p>

<p class=Verses>““But now he has died; why should I fast? Can I bring him back
again? I will go to him, but he will not return to me.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Samuel
12:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““And he said, ‘Then I beg you, father, that you send him to my
father’s house— for I have five brothers—in order that he may warn them, so
that they will not also come to this place of torment.’ “But Abraham said, ‘They
have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear them.’ “But he said, ‘No, father
Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent!’ “But he
said to him, ‘If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be
persuaded even if someone rises from the dead.’““&nbsp;&nbsp;(Luke 16:27-31,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Is communication with the dead necessary? The biblical
answer is no! Since we have the Word of God, we know what loved ones are doing
after death, whether believer or unbeliever.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Is communication with the dead permitted? The biblical
answer is again no! God does not condone the seance or necromancy from any
angle. Why? Because there are certain things unsaved people can do which brings
them into contact with demons which will mislead them with regard to eternal
things. In such demonic communication, an engastromouthos or ventriloquist
demon is often involved. Lev. 19:31; Lev. 20:26-27; Deut. 18:9-12; 2 Kings
23:24. </p>

<p class=Verses>“‘Do not turn to mediums or spiritists; do not seek them out to
be defiled by them. I am the LORD your God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Leviticus 19:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“‘Thus you are to be holy to Me, for I the LORD am holy; and I
have set you apart from the peoples to be Mine. ‘Now a man or a woman who is a
medium or a spiritist shall surely be put to death. They shall be stoned with
stones, their bloodguiltiness is upon them.’““&nbsp;&nbsp;(Leviticus 20:26-27,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Moreover, Josiah removed the mediums and the spiritists and
the teraphim and the idols and all the abominations that were seen in the land
of Judah and in Jerusalem, that he might confirm the words of the law which
were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the
LORD.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Kings 23:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>With whom do people communicate when in touch with the
spirit world? Per Isaiah 8:19, they communicate with ventriloquist demons who
mimic the departed dead or control the vocal cords of the living. Isaiah 29:4
refers to demons which control the vocal cords. Fakery can also be involved.
Necromancy, fortune tellers, tea leaf readers, hypnotism, and tongues can all
be the result of demon possession, fakery, or wide emotional swings. It can run
the gamut from one extreme to another.</p>

<p class=Verses>“When they say to you, “Consult the mediums and the spiritists
who whisper and mutter,” should not a people consult their God? Should they
consult the dead on behalf of the living?”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah 8:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then you will be brought low; From the earth you will speak,
And from the dust where you are prostrate Your words will come. Your voice will
also be like that of a spirit from the ground, And your speech will whisper
from the dust.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah 29:4, NASB)</p>
