<h2><a name="_D-Laws_of_Divine"></a><a name="_Laws_of_Divine"></a>Laws of Divine
Establishment</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The laws of divine establishment define freedom in terms
of privacy, property and authority. God has ordained certain laws for the
survival and freedom of the human race. Anarchy exists when segments of nations
ignore these laws. The laws of divine establishment provide the freedom in a
nation to fulfill God's plan just as He ordained in the Divine Decrees. These
freedoms are designed to function under many different types of government.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The laws of divine establishment are designed for
believers and unbelievers. Divine establishment laws depend on authority
orientation and directly affects freedom, civilization, authority, evangelism,
spiritual growth, and perpetuation of the human race. They are very important.
No one can enjoy life’s freedoms without authority orientation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Human freedom depends on the availability of personal
privacy and the function of legitimate authority to maintain that privacy. You
must have respect for people by giving them their privacy. The laws of divine
establishment were designed to protect human freedoms so that the Gospel of
Jesus Christ could be freely disseminated. Freedom to accept or reject Jesus
Christ as Savior should be available to anyone without coercion or punishment.
A person’s decision to either have a personal relationship with God or to
reject such a relationship should be a private matter. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The laws of divine establishment protect the uncoerced
expression of individual free will in a society. The government of that society
that allows free will expression when given the Gospel of Jesus Christ or other
religious freedoms is a government that is fulfilling the laws of divine
establishment. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Four Divine Institutions</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has ordained certain institutions for the orderly
preservation of the human race and to maximize personal freedom and therefore
maximize evangelism. God set up the four Divine Institutions - Volition,
Marriage, Family, and Nationalism for the entire human race, not for believers
only. The divine purpose for the Divine Institutions is for the preservation of
the human race, so that the angelic conflict can run its course, and so that
the human race will remain free to accept Jesus Christ or reject Him. Divine
Institutions are different from Christian institutions such as the local church
which are for believers only. Divine institutions are found in Genesis 2-11. In
each, there is divinely authorized authority. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Divine Institution 1 - Volition</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Volition is the right to decide to be either dependent
upon God or to act independently of Him. Each member of the human race has the
personal authority to make their own decisions and to be responsible for those
decisions. This authority of your volition should give you confidence in your
own decisions. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For example, Adam and Eve in the Garden made a decision
to be married. In Genesis 2-3, the animals were named by Adam and choices were
made in the Garden as to the forbidden fruit. They both decided, based on their
own free will, to disobey God's singular mandate to not eat the fruit on a
single tree in the Garden. This single command from God was the very first time
in human history that volition became an issue. Gen. 2:16-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD God commanded the man, saying, &quot;From any tree of
the garden you may eat freely; but from the tree of the knowledge of good and
evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat from it you will surely
die.&quot;” (Genesis 2:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Under maximum freedom under innocence in the Garden,
there was but one law - “From any tree of the garden you may eat freely; but
from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat.” Under
maximum freedom, there are laws to be respected. The Ten Commandments were
given from God to the Israelites as a Magna Carta of human freedom. Exodus
20:2-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land
of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. &quot;You shall have no other gods
before Me.” (Exodus 20:2-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The soul is made up of self-consciousness, mentality,
emotion, and volition as the authority of the soul. Our soul’s authority is
called volition or free will or self-determination. Your decisions and choices
determine the life that you will lead. Volition provides each of us the
authority to obey or disobey when given a choice. With your personal choices
comes responsibility for the consequences for those decisions, intended or
unintended. Your volition is your authority to make good decisions from a position
of strength or bad decisions from a position of weakness.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The most critical choices in life are whether to accept
or reject the existence of God (God-consciousness) and then to either accept or
reject the work of Jesus Christ on the Cross for the sins of mankind. Following
those positive volition decisions, the believer’s decisions determine the level
of spiritual growth that they will attain in this life. For the ones who reject
the existence of God and then reject the work of Jesus Christ on the Cross,
their eternal path remains unchanged – the Lake of Fire. John 3:36.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who
does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on
him.&quot;” (John 3:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Human freedom cannot exist without privacy and authority.
We must have freedom and privacy for the proper function our free will. This is
why the laws of divine establishment are so important. However, it is still
possible to exercise spiritual freedom while under a loss of human freedom such
as living under slavery. For example, in the Roman Empire, slaves were
generally free to come and go and could still be evangelized and grow
spiritually. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/UV/Volition.html">Volition</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Divine Institution 2 – Marriage </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Divine Institution of Marriage is the most basic and
fundamental organization in the human race. Marriage is also a basic
organization in any nation. God has ordained marriage to be a man-woman
relationship since the first marriage. Jesus Christ performed the first
marriage in the Garden of Eden when He brought to Adam the perfect woman for
Adam that He had constructed from Adam’s rib. Gen. 2:18; Gen. 2:22-23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD God said, &quot;It is not good for the man to be
alone; I will make him a helper suitable for him.&quot;” (Genesis 2:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD God fashioned into a woman the rib which He had taken
from the man, and brought her to the man. The man said, &quot;This is now bone
of my bones, And flesh of my flesh; She shall be called Woman, Because she was
taken out of Man.&quot;” (Genesis 2:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first marriage of the human race continued after the Fall.
The Divine Institution of Marriage has never been cancelled by God in any
generation. Marriage has always been a permanent relationship between one man
and one woman. 1 Cor 7:2-4; Eph. 5:22-23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But because of immoralities, each man is to have his own wife,
and each woman is to have her own husband. The husband must fulfill his duty to
his wife, and likewise also the wife to her husband. The wife does not have
authority over her own body, but the husband does; and likewise also the
husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does.” (1
Corinthians 7:2-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord. For
the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church,
He Himself being the Savior of the body.” (Ephesians 5:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The husband-wife relationship in marriage is the normal
and legitimate expression of soul rapport love and sexual love. Eph. 5:28; Eph.
5:33; 1 Cor. 7:9; Heb. 13:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own
bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself;” (Ephesians 5:28, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“Nevertheless, each individual among you also is to love his
own wife even as himself, and the wife must see to it that she respects her
husband.” (Ephesians 5:33, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But if they do not have self-control, let them marry; for it
is better to marry than to burn with passion.” (1 Corinthians 7:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Marriage is to be held in honor among all, and the marriage
bed is to be undefiled; for fornicators and adulterers God will judge.”
(Hebrews 13:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Husband is the authority in marriage and the head of the
home. Marriage is for believers and unbelievers. If the Divine Institution of Marriage
is violated on a widespread scale, a nation can be destroyed. Marriage is the
basis for stability in society and for the formation of civilization. It is the
protection for the home where the parents exercise authority over the children.
Gen. 3:16; Col. 3:18-19. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/M/Marriage%20Principles.html">Marriage
Principles</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“To the woman He said, “I will greatly multiply Your pain in
childbirth, In pain you will bring forth children; Yet your desire will be for
your husband, And he will rule over you.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis 3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.
Husbands, love your wives and do not be embittered against them.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Colossians
3:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Divine Institution 3 – Family </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Divine Institution of Family is the institution set
up by God to raise and train children with respect for authority, respect for
the rights of others, respect for the privacy of others, respect for common
law, respect for the property of others, plus many other principles. Genesis 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Parents have authority over their children in this
institution until they reach adulthood.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The purpose of the authority of parents is to protect,
teach, and discipline their children to prepare them for life. Parents who do
not exercise their authority over their children and instead seek to befriend
their children have abdicated their God-given purpose. Parents should seek the
respect and obedience of their children first. Their children must first be
authority oriented to certain principles in life. Eph. 6:1-3; Col. 3:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is
right. HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER (which is the first commandment with a
promise), SO THAT IT MAY BE WELL WITH YOU, AND THAT YOU MAY LIVE LONG ON THE
EARTH.&quot;  (Ephesians 6:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Children, be obedient to your parents in all things, for
this is well-pleasing to the Lord.&quot;  (Colossians 3:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Adults do not have to explain their volitional decisions
to their children. Adults have privileges that children do not have in matters
of volition. Responsibility is not a volitional thing. Responsibility is an
absolute. A choice was not given in responsibilities. Our decisions are not to
be made on the basis of societal pressure. Something is not to be done because
the community did it or because the neighbors did it.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The decisions were made by the parents and not as a
family co-operative. Parents make better decisions than children. Parents do
not always make the right decisions. Parents do not always know the right
decision to make. The parents’ goal for their children should be to excel and
operate to peak capacity in school, get good grades, focus daily on the intake
and application of Bible doctrine, etc. Parents’ responsibility is to instill a
respect for the Word of God and the teaching of Bible doctrine. This spiritual
responsibility is the highest responsibility that parents have. Deut. 6:6-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;These words, which I am commanding you today, shall be
on your heart. &quot;You shall teach them diligently to your sons and shall
talk of them when you sit in your house and when you walk by the way and when
you lie down and when you rise up. &quot;You shall bind them as a sign on your
hand and they shall be as frontals on your forehead. &quot;You shall write them
on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.” (Deuteronomy 6:6-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We should all strive to be the best at what we do. We are
to do everything as unto the Lord. If you realize that you are not the best at
what you do, then you should reassess your performance and then retrain, take
classes, etc. to aim to become the best. However, your pursuit of being the
best at what you do should adhere to the principles of Bible doctrine in order
to say you are working as unto the Lord. While others may climb or run over
people to excel, you as a believer in Jesus Christ are held to a far higher
standard. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Parents who truly love their children will teach critical
authority orientation principles using forms of discipline. Children must be
taught to respect the privacy, property, and rights of others. They must be
taught to not abuse their freedom and to respect the systems of authority in
the society in which they live. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/F/Family%2C%20Divine%20Institution%203.html">The
Family</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Divine Institution 4 – Nationalism </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Nationalism is the means of protecting and preserving the
human race so that no segment of individuals gain enough power to destroy the
rest of the human race and eventually themselves. Nationalism is a human
barrier against the supremacy of evil in the world controlled by Satan and
protects from the power lust of the old sin nature. Nationalism is authorized
by God. Gen. 10:5; Deut. 32:8; Acts 17:26-28.</p>

<p class=Verses>“From these the coastlands of the nations were separated into
their lands, every one according to his language, according to their families,
into their nations.” (Genesis 10:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance,
When He separated the sons of man, He set the boundaries of the peoples
According to the number of the sons of Israel.” (Deuteronomy 32:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and He made from one man every nation of mankind to live on
all the face of the earth, having determined their appointed times and the
boundaries of their habitation, that they would seek God, if perhaps they might
grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us; for in
Him we live and move and exist, as even some of your own poets have said, 'For
we also are His children.'” (Acts 17:26-28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The purpose of nationalism is to provide protection so
that the individual volition can operate under maximum freedom and liberty. In
contrast, internationalism is anti-biblical. Organizations that espouse
internationalism operate under a system of evil. These include the United
Nations, organizations or governments that promote socialism or communism,
organizations that promote the international redistribution of wealth, and any
religious or political group that is international in scope.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Government has divinely-delegated authority that is
vested in the governmental leaders of each nation. This includes common law
(judges on the bench and policemen) and the laws of limitation for the benefit
of others (civil code, driver’s license, etc.) Gen. 11:1-9; Rom. 13:1; 1 Tim.
2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now the whole earth used the same language and the same words.
It came about as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of
Shinar and settled there. They said to one another, “Come, let us make bricks
and burn them thoroughly.” And they used brick for stone, and they used tar for
mortar. They said, “Come, let us build for ourselves a city, and a tower whose
top will reach into heaven, and let us make for ourselves a name, otherwise we
will be scattered abroad over the face of the whole earth.” The LORD came down
to see the city and the tower which the sons of men had built. The LORD said, “Behold,
they are one people, and they all have the same language. And this is what they
began to do, and now nothing which they purpose to do will be impossible for
them. “Come, let Us go down and there confuse their language, so that they will
not understand one another’s speech.” So the LORD scattered them abroad from
there over the face of the whole earth; and they stopped building the city.
Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the LORD confused the
language of the whole earth; and from there the LORD scattered them abroad over
the face of the whole earth.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis 11:1-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Every person is to be in subjection to the governing
authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist
are established by God.” (Romans 13:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is not the author of confusion. 1 Cor. 14:40.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But all things must be done properly and in an orderly manner.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Corinthians 14:40, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Resistance to authority can lead to criminal activity.
Subscribing to any form of internationalism opposes Divine Institution 4 -
Nationalism. Religion also opposes divinely established authority because
religion always sponsors international­ism. Socialism challenges established
authority because it tries to make everyone equal. Volition gives everyone the
right to choose a vocation. Romans 13:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore whoever resists authority has opposed the ordinance
of God; and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
13:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Rulers have the authority to uphold the laws of their
land. The principle of authority is to reward the good and prosecute the evil,
criminal activity or violation of common law. Rom. 13:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior, but for
evil. Do you want to have no fear of authority? Do what is good and you will
have praise from the same;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 13:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For enforcing the laws of the land, there are various
degrees of punishment including capital punishment. In Romans 13:4, “bear the
sword” refers to the Roman method of capital punishment for Roman citizens -
beheading. Today it would be the electric chair, gas chamber, chemical
injection, hanging, etc. This is God’s approved method of removing the mad dogs
of society following legal due process for that nation. </p>

<p class=Verses>“for it is a minister of God to you for good. But if you do
what is evil, be afraid; for it does not bear the sword for nothing; for it is
a minister of God, an avenger who brings wrath on the one who practices evil.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
13:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The principle of subjection to the law occurs in two
ways. Some are restrained by fear of the government’s wrath. Some are
restrained by their conscience. Rom. 13:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore it is necessary to be in subjection, not only
because of wrath, but also for conscience’ sake.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 13:5,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For financing the nation, God has ordained the principle
of taxation - that is taxation with representation. In the U.S., we have
federal income tax, state income taxes depending on which state you live in,
sales tax, etc. There are also many other taxes embedded in what you buy, how
you buy, where you buy, etc. All such taxes are divinely authorized. You might not
like them, but the believer is mandated to adhere to such laws. Rom. 13:6-7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For because of this you also pay taxes, for rulers are
servants of God, devoting themselves to this very thing. Render to all what is
due them: tax to whom tax is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear;
honor to whom honor.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 13:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When a national entity violates the Divine Institutions,
the citizens of that country are under obligation to the Word of God and not
the slavery laws of that country which usually means miraculous deliverance or
death. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>National confusion due to rejection of God’s Divine
Institutions is seen in Isaiah 24:2 and Jeremiah 6:13-19. The result of
national rejection of God and His Word is never a good one.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the people will be like the priest, the servant like his
master, the maid like her mistress, the buyer like the seller, the lender like
the borrower, the creditor like the debtor.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah 24:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““For from the least of them even to the greatest of them,
Everyone is greedy for gain, And from the prophet even to the priest Everyone
deals falsely. “They have healed the brokenness of My people superficially,
Saying, ‘Peace, peace,’ But there is no peace. “Were they ashamed because of
the abomination they have done? They were not even ashamed at all; They did not
even know how to blush. Therefore they shall fall among those who fall; At the
time that I punish them, They shall be cast down,” says the LORD. Thus says the
LORD, “Stand by the ways and see and ask for the ancient paths, Where the good
way is, and walk in it; And you will find rest for your souls. But they said, ‘We
will not walk in it.’ “And I set watchmen over you, saying, ‘Listen to the
sound of the trumpet!’ But they said, ‘We will not listen.’ “Therefore hear, O
nations, And know, O congregation, what is among them. “Hear, O earth: behold,
I am bringing disaster on this people, The fruit of their plans, Because they
have not listened to My words, And as for My law, they have rejected it also.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jeremiah
6:13-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Divine Establishment Characteristics of a Nation</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There should be protection of freedom within the nation
by a system of law enforcement, a judicial system that adheres to the written
rule of law, a system of justice that places the burden of proof of guilt on
the accuser rather than the accused, where testimony on a court of law relies
on testimony based on facts rather than hearsay, and where no one can be tried
twice for the same crime (double jeopardy).</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The nation’s military should be well-trained and
well-equipped to protect the nation from external enemies. The nation’s
government should protect the freedoms and rights of its citizens based on use
of legitimate power based on written law. The nation’s economy must be based on
free enterprise and capitalism where private businesses are free to function
within the written law without government interference. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The nation’s system of law protects the freedoms, rights,
life, and property of its citizens. The nation’s culture should reflect the
freedoms to worship God as the citizens wish, believers should be free to live
their spiritual lives, there should be an established system of social mores
that clearly defines morality, encourages patriotism, and promotes the future
of the nation through the arts.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The nation should be governed with legally-defined powers
to administer the proper function of tax collection, enforcement of written
laws, an objective court system based on the rule of written law, and support
for a well trained and equipped military.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Ten Commandments Define Human Freedom</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Ten Commandments (the Decalogue) are part of the laws
of divine establishment and were designed to protect human freedoms. They
define freedom in terms of morality, privacy, property, and authority. Freedom
is the basic heritage of a nation to God and is critical for the function of
evangelism, spiritual growth, and missionary outreach. The Decalogue doesn't
deal with sin but with human freedom because certain sins actually oppose human
freedom. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Ten Commandments were written by God on two stone tablets
and then given to Moses on Mount Sinai. The record of the Ten Commandments can
be found in Exodus 20:2-17 and Deuteronomy 5:6-21.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The First Commandment</u> - Exodus 20:3. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first commandment deals with worship of only The God
to the absolute exclusion of other gods.  There are many religions that worship
other gods. The first commandment also prohibits mental or soul idolatry. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;You shall have no other gods before Me.&quot; 
(Exodus 20:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Second Commandment</u> - Exodus 20:4-6. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The second commandment deals with idols or objects that
depict other gods (any likeness) to which people may render overt worship. This
includes idols such as the golden calf of the Exodus, statues of God or Christ
and “any likeness of what is in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the
water under the earth” which includes worshipping fish, oxen, the cow, or any
animal or bird or sea life. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;You shall not make for yourself an idol, or any
likeness of what is in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the water
under the earth. &quot;You shall not worship them or serve them; for I, the
LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the
children, on the third and the fourth generations of those who hate Me, but
showing lovingkindness to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My
commandments.&quot;  (Exodus 20:4-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Exodus 20:5, “serve them” refers to providing
sacrifices (animal), food, clothing, human sacrifices, and entering into the
sexual activities of the Phallic Cult. “Am a jealous God” is an anthropopathism
that conveys God the Father’s policy of forbidding idolatry in any form. This
was for the protection of Israel and to keep the nation from moral and immoral
degeneracy. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Iniquities of the fathers” means that negative volition
cannot be perpetuated past four generations. If so, divine discipline escalates
to include death of the family line, war, famine, pestilence and the many forms
of the five cycles of divine discipline on a nation that opposes God and turns
away from His mandates. In Jeremiah’s day, negative volition for two
generations resulted in the Fifth Cycle of Discipline. Exodus 20:6 shows the
positive side of this commandment to them that have positive volition toward
God and His commandments.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Overt idolatry is said to be contact with demons which
destroys human freedom and ultimately the nation. 1 Cor. 10:19-21; Isaiah 2:8;
Ezek. 6:4-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“What do I mean then? That a thing sacrificed to idols is
anything, or that an idol is anything? No, but I say that the things which the
Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God; and I do not want
you to become sharers in demons. You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the
cup of demons; you cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of
demons.” (1 Corinthians 10:19-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Their land has also been filled with idols; They worship the
work of their hands, That which their fingers have made.” (Isaiah 2:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;So your altars will become desolate and your incense
altars will be smashed; and I will make your slain fall in front of your idols.
&quot;I will also lay the dead bodies of the sons of Israel in front of their
idols; and I will scatter your bones around your altars. &quot;In all your
dwellings, cities will become waste and the high places will be desolate, that
your altars may become waste and desolate, your idols may be broken and brought
to an end, your incense altars may be cut down, and your works may be blotted
out.” (Ezekiel 6:4-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Third Commandment</u> - Exodus 20:7.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The third commandment means to take an oath using the
name of God such as; “as God is my witness, such and such happened” or to use
God’s name to cover your lies. You can try to coerce some girl to marry you by
saying, “It’s God’s will or the Lord led me to you.” </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in
vain, for the LORD will not leave him unpunished who takes His name in
vain.&quot;  (Exodus 20:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“You shall not take” is the qal imperfect of <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>נשׂא</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(nâśâ') plus the negative is used as a
prohibition. Translation, you shall not lift up the voice. “In vain” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שׁוא</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(shâv') and means for an evil purpose,
for vanity, for a false purpose, for worthlessness.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This commandment prohibits the use of God’s name for vain
and unworthy objects including false testimony in the name of God in a court of
law and false swearing in any phase of life like, “as God is my witness.” You
are either telling the truth or lying. Don’t bring God into it either way!
Other examples include “so help me God” or in most instances, “God willing” or
“God strike me dead.” These false oaths are often connected with an
exaggeration or a half-lie with the intention to deceive. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Therefore, this commandment prohibits using the name of
God to cover a lie, attaching God’s will or God’s name to some project which
you want to get through. God’s name is rightly used in prayer, praise,
thanksgiving, unconditional love toward others, and doctrinal communication.
God’s name is not to be used in profanity, lying, hate, or bullying a
congregation to take a course of action. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Decalogue is designed to defend human liberty and
freedom. “Will not leave him unpunished” is the piel imperfect of <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>נקה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(nâqâh) and means that the Lord will not
acquit him. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Fourth Commandment</u> - Exodus 20:8-10.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Jewish Age, Saturday provided freedom. In the
Church Age, Sunday provides freedom. In Exodus 20:8, “Remember” is the qal
infinitive absolute of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>זכר</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(zâkar) and refers
to the frame of reference and memory center in the right lobe of the soul and
means to think Bible doctrine.  “Sabbath” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שׁבּת</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(shabbâth) and is taken from the verb “to
rest.” “To keep it holy” is the piel infinitive of <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>קדשׁ</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(qâdash) and means to set apart, to consecrate, to do
something on that day they didn’t do on other days - to rest. This means a
complete relaxation day. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/S/The%20Sabbath.html">The Sabbath</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.
&quot;Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a
sabbath of the LORD your God; in it you shall not do any work, you or your son
or your daughter, your male or your female servant or your cattle or your
sojourner who stays with you.&quot;  (Exodus 20:8-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Sabbath also recognizes that people who work for a
living have to have time to rest. People need to rest to get ready for the next
week. Without some rest, you become a slave to your job. You need opportunity
to exercise your freedom and personal volition outside the workplace. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Fifth Commandment</u> - Exodus 20:12.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fifth commandment establishes authority early in
everyone’s life. The first authority in life is that of your parents. The fifth
commandment says honor not love. It is more important for children to recognize
the authority of their parents than to love them. Love will follow later in
life. Many a young person has gone back to their parents and said, “I want to
thank you for not letting me run loose. I want to thank you for not letting me
date at 16 when I was so stupid. Thank you for keeping me from doing various
things when everyone else did. Thank you for putting your foot down.”</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Honor your father and your mother, that your days
may be prolonged in the land which the LORD your God gives you.&quot;  (Exodus
20:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Honor means to recognize and orient to the authority of
parents. Children who honor their parents in childhood and teenage years will
live a longer life. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/A/Authority%20Orientation.html">Authority
Orientation</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Sixth Commandment</u> - Exodus 20:13.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The sixth commandment has to do with crime. God forbids
murder, the unlawful taking of human life in private vengeance or otherwise.
Murder is the basic violation of human freedom. People should live under the
principle of “live and let live.” Killing is bona fide in justified warfare.
Killing is bona fide in capital punishment. Killing is bona fide in protection
of life, limb and protection of property in defense against criminals. See
category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/M/Murder.html">Murder</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;You shall not murder.&quot;  (Exodus 20:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Seventh Commandment</u> - Exodus 20:14.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The seventh commandment deals with the sanctity of sex
only within marriage of a man and his woman. Acceptance of sexual intercourse
outside of marriage is a good indicator of the level of moral degeneracy of a
society and a nation. Our Lord reminded us in Matthew 5:27-30 that the marriage
sexual relationship must be guarded diligently. See category on <a
href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/M/Marriage%2C%20Sex%20in%20Marriage.html">Marriage, Sex in Marriage</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;You shall not commit adultery.&quot;  (Exodus
20:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;You have heard that it was said, 'YOU SHALL NOT
COMMIT ADULTERY'; but I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust
for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. &quot;If your
right eye makes you stumble, tear it out and throw it from you; for it is
better for you to lose one of the parts of your body, than for your whole body
to be thrown into hell. &quot;If your right hand makes you stumble, cut it off
and throw it from you; for it is better for you to lose one of the parts of
your body, than for your whole body to go into hell.&quot;  (Matthew 5:27-30,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Adultery is both a sin and an attack on human freedom.
Capacity for love and life is distorted and ruined, so that adultery not only
abuses freedom, but destroys the possibility for happiness in life. A greater
regard for the sanctity of marriage is needed today. Marriage vows are under
attack today and many say they are not needed anymore and that marriage is
outmoded. The Word of God says otherwise! </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Eighth Commandment</u> - Exodus 20:15.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The eighth commandment emphasizes the right of private
property and forbids theft or stealing that which you do not own. Theft has
negative consequences in most societies. Where theft is allowed or such laws
are not enforced, societal degeneracy results and freedom of property ownership
is lost. Instead, we are to be content with what we have and trust God to
supply all our needs in Christ Jesus. 1 Tim. 6:6; Phil. 4:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;You shall not steal.&quot;  (Exodus 20:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But godliness actually is a means of great gain when
accompanied by contentment.&quot;  (1 Timothy 6:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And my God will supply all your needs according to His
riches in glory in Christ Jesus.&quot;  (Philippians 4:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Ninth Commandment</u> - Exodus 20:16.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The ninth commandment emphasizes the protection of human
freedom through objectivity in the function of the law. This commandment
forbids the sins of libel, slander, deceit, and calls for the truth and nothing
but the truth. The laws of evidence demand truth in courtroom testimony.
Hearsay is not admissible as testimony.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;You shall not bear false witness against your
neighbor.&quot;  (Exodus 20:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The ninth commandment forbids bribery and forgery and
even the least suggestion contrary to truth. Such false witness is the most
damaging in a court of law where false information is given or critical
information is withheld to sway the outcome of the court’s decision. A nation
and a society must function based on the rule of law. It cannot function properly
with unchecked perjury, gossip and maligning.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Tenth Commandment</u> - Exodus 20:17.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The tenth commandment deals with desiring or coveting
that which is not yours. This includes the possessions of others in all forms.
“Covet” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>חמד</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(châmad) and means
to desire, to take pleasure in, to find delectable, to lust after.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you
shall not covet your neighbor's wife or his male servant or his female servant
or his ox or his donkey or anything that belongs to your neighbor.&quot;&quot; 
(Exodus 20:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has promised to meet all our needs, both spiritual
and physical with His grace resources in the spiritual life. Bible doctrine in
the soul produces a contentment with what God has provided. Phil. 4:19; Matt.
6:33; Heb. 13:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And my God will supply all your needs according to His
riches in glory in Christ Jesus.&quot;  (Philippians 4:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness,
and all these things will be added to you.&quot;  (Matthew 6:33, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Make sure that your character is free from the love of
money, being content with what you have; for He Himself has said, &quot;I WILL
NEVER DESERT YOU, NOR WILL I EVER FORSAKE YOU,&quot;&quot;  (Hebrews 13:5,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Authority Orientation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Functional society cannot exist without authority
orientation. God delegates authorized authority under the laws of divine
establishment for the human race to exist and prosper. This includes believers
and unbelievers. These systems of authority provide for some to have
jurisdiction over and responsibility for others.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The laws of divine establishment do not pertain to
spiritual matters. That authority is the Word of God and the delegated
authority delineated by Bible doctrine. Divinely delegated authority includes
the authority of husband over wife, parents over children, teachers over
students, coaches over athletes, management over labor, and police officers
over the public under their jurisdiction. In marriage, the husband has the
authority over the wife. Eph. 5:22; Col. 3:18. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord.”
(Ephesians 5:22, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the
Lord.” (Colossians 3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Management has authority in business over those employed
in that business. Such authority orientation allows the business to flourish.
Healthy businesses provide stability for the local, regional, and national
economies. Eph. 6:5; Col. 3:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Slaves, be obedient to those who are your masters according to
the flesh, with fear and trembling, in the sincerity of your heart, as to
Christ;” (Ephesians 6:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Slaves, in all things obey those who are your masters on
earth, not with external service, as those who merely please men, but with
sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord.” (Colossians 3:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the military, authority orientation is critical to
preserving the freedom of the nation. Neh. 4:13-15. See category on <a
href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/A/Authority%20Orientation.html">Authority Orientation</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“then I stationed men in the lowest parts of the space behind
the wall, the exposed places, and I stationed the people in families with their
swords, spears and bows. When I saw their fear, I rose and spoke to the nobles,
the officials and the rest of the people: &quot;Do not be afraid of them;
remember the Lord who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your
sons, your daughters, your wives and your houses.&quot; When our enemies heard
that it was known to us, and that God had frustrated their plan, then all of us
returned to the wall, each one to his work.” (Nehemiah 4:13-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Spiritual Freedom Versus Human Freedom</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The laws of divine establishment were designed by God to
protect human freedom so that evangelism and spiritual advance can occur in
every generation. These laws protect the privacy, property, freedom, and
volition of mankind. Freedom is an extension of soul function that includes our
volition, mentality, emotion, conscience, and self-consciousness.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The laws of divine establishment deal with human freedom for
the human race (believer and unbeliever) while the Word of God deals with spiritual
freedom for the believer only. Since man was created to resolve the Angelic
Conflict, freedom is an extension of that conflict into human history. God
provides His grace resources and your spiritual freedom to live the spiritual
life regardless of your human circumstances. 2 Cor. 3:17; Psalms 119:45; Gal.
5:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord
is, there is liberty.” (2 Corinthians 3:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And I will walk at liberty, For I seek Your precepts.” (Psalms
119:45, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“It was for freedom that Christ set us free; therefore keep
standing firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery.” (Galatians
5:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Lord delineates the Christian responsibility in the
civil area and in the spiritual area. When you advance spiritually to fulfill the
plan of God for your life, you demonstrate that God's solutions are the only
true solutions to problems in the nation. 1 Peter 2:13-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every human
institution, whether to a king as the one in authority, or to governors as sent
by him for the punishment of evildoers and the praise of those who do right.”
(1 Peter 2:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Morality</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Morality results from the observation of and conformity
to the laws of divine establishment.  Morality can be produced by the believer
and unbeliever. Believers with civil responsibility also have a moral
responsibility. The spiritual life is not morality, but is only one
manifestation of the divine good produced in the spiritual life. The believer
has a responsibility to their nation to obey the laws of divine establishment.
The growing believer should never be anti-establishment or immoral. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Morality is the result of spiritual growth, but is not an
indicator that you are spiritual. Unbelievers can be moral based on their
adherence to the laws of divine establishment. Therefore, morality is not
unique to the Christian way of life. Morality protects human freedom, but is
not a means of obtaining eternal salvation. Gal. 2:16; Rom. 3:20; Titus 3:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“nevertheless knowing that a man is not justified by the works
of the Law but through faith in Christ Jesus, even we have believed in Christ
Jesus, so that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of
the Law; since by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified.” (Galatians
2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“because by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified in
His sight; for through the Law comes the knowledge of sin.” (Romans 3:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done in
righteousness, but according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration and
renewing by the Holy Spirit,” (Titus 3:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Human Freedom and the Military</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Failure of the military to protect the nation from
outside aggression means loss of freedom for those living in that nation. Such
disastrous failure in battle can be caused by lack of leadership, inadequate training
and planning, lack or moral and spiritual courage in the soul of the soldier, but
mostly from poor authority orientation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Human freedom is always related to authority orientation.
Freedom without authority is anarchy. Authority without freedom is tyranny. The
military character usually reflects the national character. Lack of support for
or even opposition toward the military reduces the military’s effectiveness. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The soldiers within the military who come from a society
of reversionistic, apostate, and degenerate people will render military
training ineffective. Lack of authority orientation destroys the function of
the military as the instrument of freedom. Military victory is also the means
of maintaining peace between nations. Joshua 11:23; Psalms 46:7-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD
had spoken to Moses, and Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel according
to their divisions by their tribes. Thus the land had rest from war.” (Joshua
11:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD of hosts is with us; The God of Jacob is our
stronghold. Selah. Come, behold the works of the LORD, Who has wrought
desolations in the earth. He makes wars to cease to the end of the earth; He
breaks the bow and cuts the spear in two; He burns the chariots with fire.”
(Psalms 46:7-9, NASB)</p>
