<h2>Demon Possession </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A demon is a fallen angel who chose with Satan to oppose
God. A believer cannot be indwelt by a demon because every Church Age
believer’s body is indwelt by all three members of the Trinity. However, the
believer’s soul can be demon influenced due to long-term carnality and lack of
spiritual growth. The soul containing Bible doctrine is the fortress of the
body. <i>Epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the soul is
protection from demon influence of the believer. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Demon possession in the Old Testament was very dangerous
to the well-being of a national entity. Therefore, it was punishable by death.
Lev. 20:27.</p>

<p class=Verses>“‘Now a man or a woman who is a medium or a spiritist shall
surely be put to death. They shall be stoned with stones, their bloodguiltiness
is upon them.’““&nbsp;&nbsp;(Leviticus 20:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalm 96: 5, “idols” refers to demons. All idol
worship is worship of demons. Every idol has one or more demons connected with
it. Lev. 17:7; 1 Cor. 10:19-21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For all the gods of the peoples are idols, But the LORD made
the heavens.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 96:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““They shall no longer sacrifice their sacrifices to the goat
demons with which they play the harlot. This shall be a permanent statute to
them throughout their generations.”‘“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Leviticus 17:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“What do I mean then? That a thing sacrificed to idols is
anything, or that an idol is anything? No, but I say that the things which the
Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God; and I do not want
you to become sharers in demons. You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the
cup of demons; you cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of
demons.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 10:19-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When God judged the Egyptians with the death of their first
born, He judged their gods or demons. Apostasy is connected with demons. Deut.
23:15-18; Psalms 106:37; 1 Tim. 4:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>““You shall not hand over to his master a slave who has escaped
from his master to you. “He shall live with you in your midst, in the place
which he shall choose in one of your towns where it pleases him; you shall not
mistreat him. “None of the daughters of Israel shall be a cult prostitute, nor
shall any of the sons of Israel be a cult prostitute. “You shall not bring the
hire of a harlot or the wages of a dog into the house of the LORD your God for
any votive offering, for both of these are an abomination to the LORD your God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Deuteronomy
23:15-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“They even sacrificed their sons and their daughters to the
demons,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 106:37, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will
fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and doctrines
of demons,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Timothy 4:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satyrs are demons. Satyrs, the minor forest gods of Greek
mythology, had the face, torso, and arms of a man, the ears and tail of a goat,
and two goatlike legs. Satyrs are depicted many times in ancient art. Jer. 34:18-20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“‘I will give the men who have transgressed My covenant, who
have not fulfilled the words of the covenant which they made before Me, when
they cut the calf in two and passed between its parts— the officials of Judah
and the officials of Jerusalem, the court officers and the priests and all the
people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf— I will give them
into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their life.
And their dead bodies will be food for the birds of the sky and the beasts of
the earth.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jeremiah 34:18-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are two ways for unbelievers to become demon
possessed. The first way is active submission involving isolation of dormant
faculties of the soul. An example would be the use of extra sensory perception
under demon possession. Another is faked necromancy. Actually, this is selling
the body to Satan. The second way is passive submission. This involves idolatry,
Soma mysteries (Hindu), through hallucinogenic drugs like LSD, etc., certain
types of dances (Dervish, etc.), Mesmerism (hypnotism), and contemplating
infinity. Demon possession is illustrated in Leviticus 17:7, Deuteronomy 32:17,
and 2 Chronicles 11:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>““They shall no longer sacrifice their sacrifices to the goat
demons with which they play the harlot. This shall be a permanent statute to
them throughout their generations.”‘“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Leviticus 17:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““They sacrificed to demons who were not God, To gods whom they
have not known, New gods who came lately, Whom your fathers did not dread.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Deuteronomy
32:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He set up priests of his own for the high places, for the
satyrs and for the calves which he had made.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Chronicles 11:15,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Principles of demon possession are illustrated in Mark 5.
Demon possession results in a loss of individuality, loss of consciousness, or
abnormal behavior. Society cannot solve this problem. Demon possessed people
can still be saved. The demons can come out prior to salvation or at salvation.
More than one demon can occupy a person. Demons prefer a certain area. Demons
indwell animals as well as humans. When demon possession involves mental
illness, the mental illness is removed when the demon is removed. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Please keep the following verses in proper perspective.
What these verses say is that demons are capable of causing or manifesting
these maladies or behaviors in the bodies of those unbelievers they possess. They
do not say that everyone who has these problems are demon possessed. Rarely are
these problems caused by demon possession. Demon possession can only be proven
when the demon leaves the unbeliever and the health problems or abnormal
behaviors immediately disappear. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Demon possession may cause the following abnormal
behaviors</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Convulsions: Mark 1:26; Mark 9:20. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Throwing him into convulsions, the unclean spirit cried out
with a loud voice and came out of him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Mark 1:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“They brought the boy to Him. When he saw Him, immediately the
spirit threw him into a convulsion, and falling to the ground, he began rolling
around and foaming at the mouth.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Mark 9:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Violence: Matt. 8:28.</p>

<p class=Verses>“When He came to the other side into the country of the
Gadarenes, two men who were demon-possessed met Him as they were coming out of
the tombs. They were so extremely violent that no one could pass by that way.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew
8:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Abnormal strength: Mark 5:4; Luke 8:29.</p>

<p class=Verses>“because he had often been bound with shackles and chains, and
the chains had been torn apart by him and the shackles broken in pieces, and no
one was strong enough to subdue him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Mark 5:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For He had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the
man. For it had seized him many times; and he was bound with chains and
shackles and kept under guard, and yet he would break his bonds and be driven
by the demon into the desert.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Luke 8:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Raving and self-mutilation: Mark 5:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Constantly, night and day, he was screaming among the tombs
and in the mountains, and gashing himself with stones.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Mark 5:5,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Foaming at the mouth: Luke 9:39; Mark 9:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly screams, and it
throws him into a convulsion with foaming at the mouth; and only with
difficulty does it leave him, mauling him as it leaves.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Luke 9:39,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“They brought the boy to Him. When he saw Him, immediately the
spirit threw him into a convulsion, and falling to the ground, he began rolling
around and foaming at the mouth.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Mark 9:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Nakedness: Luke 8:27.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And when He came out onto the land, He was met by a man from
the city who was possessed with demons; and who had not put on any clothing for
a long time, and was not living in a house, but in the tombs.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Luke
8:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Living in the tombs: Mark 5:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and he had his dwelling among the tombs. And no one was able
to bind him anymore, even with a chain;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Mark 5:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Grinding of teeth: Mark 9:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and whenever it seizes him, it slams him to the ground and he
foams at the mouth, and grinds his teeth and stiffens out. I told Your
disciples to cast it out, and they could not do it.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Mark 9:18,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Demon possession may cause health problems</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Demon possession can result in loss of health.  The
following are examples. Again, remember that demon possession may result in
these health problems. Having these health problems does NOT imply that these
people are demon possessed. These health problems are rarely caused by demon
possession. Demon possession can only be proven when the demon leaves the
unbeliever and the health problems immediately disappear. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Speechless or mute: Mark 9:17; Luke 11:14.</p>

<p class=Verses> “And one of the crowd answered Him, “Teacher, I brought You my
son, possessed with a spirit which makes him mute;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Mark 9:17,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He was casting out a demon, and it was mute; when the
demon had gone out, the mute man spoke; and the crowds were amazed.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Luke
11:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Blindness and mute: Matt. 12:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute was brought
to Jesus, and He healed him, so that the mute man spoke and saw.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew
12:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Seizures and demon-induced mental illness: Mark 5:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“They came to Jesus and observed the man who had been
demon-possessed sitting down, clothed and in his right mind, the very man who
had had the “legion”; and they became frightened.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Mark 5:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Accident prone: Matt. 17:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is a lunatic and is very
ill; for he often falls into the fire and often into the water.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew
17:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every system of pseudo-spirituality has demons behind it.
1 Tim. 4:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will
fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and doctrines
of demons,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Timothy 4:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Examples of Demon Possession</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The strong delusion of 2 Thessalonians 2:7-11 is
described in Isaiah 8:19-20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“When they say to you, &quot;Consult the mediums and the
spiritists who whisper and mutter,&quot; should not a people consult their God?
Should they consult the dead on behalf of the living? To the law and to the
testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, it is because they have
no dawn.” (Isaiah 8:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Isaiah 8:19, “they say” refers to false prophets. “The
mediums” in the Hebrew is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>אוב</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>('ôb) and is
pronounced (ahv) and means a ventriloquist demon, a fallen angel who controls
the vocal cords, causing the person to speak in a different voice. This word
also used for snake.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Spiritists” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>ידּעני</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>(yidde‛ônı̂y) and refers to a demon possessed man (medium) and a demon possessed
woman (witch). “Whisper and mutter” refers to a high falsetto sound and a deep
hollow tone, respectively. The principle here is that they were not to go to
any of these demon-possessed individuals, but to the Word of God, which is the
basis of divine guidance.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 16:16-18, “divination” is πύθων (puthōn) and
refers to the worship of snakes is directly connected with demonism. Satan possessed
the serpent in the Garden to deceive the woman.</p>

<p class=Verses>“It happened that as we were going to the place of prayer, a
slave-girl having a spirit of divination met us, who was bringing her masters
much profit by fortune-telling.” (Acts 16:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Isaiah 29:4 is a reference to demon possession.
Ventriloquist demons are also mentioned in Revelation 16:13-14. “Unclean
spirits like frogs” are demons that make croaking noises. The word “frog” was often
used of politicians. “They are spirits of demons” means that the ventriloquist
demons will control what is said by the rulers of earth during the Tribulation.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then you will be brought low; From the earth you will speak,
And from the dust where you are prostrate Your words will come. Your voice will
also be like that of a spirit from the ground, And your speech will whisper
from the dust.” (Isaiah 29:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the
mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean
spirits like frogs; for they are spirits of demons, performing signs, which go
out to the kings of the whole world, to gather them together for the war of the
great day of God, the Almighty.” (Revelation 16:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Mark 5:1-20, a ventriloquist demon talked with Jesus
Christ. Legion was the name of the demon because there were so many of them.
Permission was given to enter the more than 2,000 pigs owned by the people in
that region of the Gerasenes.</p>

<p class=Verses>“They came to the other side of the sea, into the country of
the Gerasenes. When He got out of the boat, immediately a man from the tombs
with an unclean spirit met Him,” (Mark 5:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Demon Possession, Saul and the Witch at Endor</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Samuel 28:1, “Philistines” refers to Dorian Greeks
who were the same as Spartans, but settled in southern Palestine. Palestine
refers to the land of the Philistines. Goliath was a Greek. They had invaded
Israel and Saul was worried.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now it came about in those days that the Philistines gathered
their armed camps for war, to fight against Israel. And Achish said to David, “Know
assuredly that you will go out with me in the camp, you and your men.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Samuel 28:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Samuel 28:3-4, Samuel was physically dead. Samuel
had previously kicked out of Israel all the male mediums, but there were a few
woman mediums or witches left.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him and
buried him in Ramah, his own city. And Saul had removed from the land those who
were mediums and spiritists. So the Philistines gathered together and came and
camped in Shunem; and Saul gathered all Israel together and they camped in
Gilboa.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Samuel 28:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Samuel 28:5-6, Saul was very afraid of the
Philistines and was out of fellowship, thus his prayers were not answered.</p>

<p class=Verses>“When Saul saw the camp of the Philistines, he was afraid and
his heart trembled greatly. When Saul inquired of the LORD, the LORD did not
answer him, either by dreams or by Urim or by prophets.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Samuel
28:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Samuel 28:7, he finally tries a demon-possessed
woman (medium) in En-dor. Saul disguised himself and went to her at night. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Saul said to his servants, “Seek for me a woman who is a
medium, that I may go to her and inquire of her.” And his servants said to him,
“Behold, there is a woman who is a medium at En-dor.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Samuel
28:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Samuel 28:8-9, Saul told her to begin and contact
whom he said to contact. The woman was wary of a trap and knew the law of the
land outlawing mediums. She didn’t know she was talking to Saul, so we know the
disguise was working.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Saul disguised himself by putting on other clothes, and
went, he and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night; and he
said, “Conjure up for me, please, and bring up for me whom I shall name to you.”
But the woman said to him, “Behold, you know what Saul has done, how he has cut
off those who are mediums and spiritists from the land. Why are you then laying
a snare for my life to bring about my death?”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Samuel 28:8-9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Samuel 28:10-11, he swore by God and took an oath
that she will not be punished and told her to contact Samuel.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Saul vowed to her by the LORD, saying, “As the LORD lives, no
punishment shall come upon you for this thing.” Then the woman said, “Whom
shall I bring up for you?” And he said, “Bring up Samuel for me.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Samuel 28:10-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Samuel 28:12, she begins her séance where she goes
under demonism and tries to crank up the “ob” demon. She has gone into her
trance and now the demon is supposed to start making noises mimicking Samuel,
but this séance got out of hand. God interrupts the séance, the ob demon starts
to sputter and the Lord actually brings up Samuel. This scared her half to
death so she screamed because she was actually seeing Saul as well as Samuel.</p>

<p class=Verses>“When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice;
and the woman spoke to Saul, saying, “Why have you deceived me? For you are
Saul.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Samuel 28:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You don’t scream at a séance. You may moan or groan, but
the medium had just violated rule No. 1 of demon possession. This scream was
different from the high-pitched whisper or the typical low moan guttural sound.
Saul didn’t know what was going on and thought this was routine séance
behavior. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This interrupted séance indicated that both the witch and
the demon had lost control of the séance. Satan himself couldn’t counter-trump
this. God interrupted the séance to bring back Samuel and of course the witch
was frightened. The witch or medium had power to contact demons, but no power
to contact the dead. Her terror at the appearance of Samuel was an exposure of
spiritism as either demonism or fakery. The witch was most frightened because
of a supernatural power greater than Satan, greater than her own was involved
and she lost her poise, her cool.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Notice that Saul was not frightened but thought this was
routine. It is important to emphasize that the witch was frightened, not Saul.
Demons can impersonate the dead, but they cannot produce the dead! Key point!
They cannot talk with the dead! Communication with the dead on the part of
mediums is always cryptic, nebulous, abstruse, and general.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Samuel 28:13, Saul told her to not be afraid. She
replied that she saw “gods.” This was actually Samuel whom she could see, but
Saul could not. The witch described Samuel as God because she knew there was
only one power greater than demons and that is God Himself. She thought God
Himself had come into the séance.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The king said to her, “Do not be afraid; but what do you see?”
And the woman said to Saul, “I see a divine being coming up out of the earth.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Samuel 28:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Samuel 28:14-15, Samuel spoke to Saul and wanted to
know why he had been disturbed and brought up.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He said to her, “What is his form?” And she said, “An old man
is coming up, and he is wrapped with a robe.” And Saul knew that it was Samuel,
and he bowed with his face to the ground and did homage. Then Samuel said to
Saul, “Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?” And Saul answered, “I am
greatly distressed; for the Philistines are waging war against me, and God has
departed from me and no longer answers me, either through prophets or by
dreams; therefore I have called you, that you may make known to me what I
should do.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Samuel 28:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Samuel 28:16-18, this is the status quo of a
believer under the sin unto death. He had not obeyed God regarding destruction
of Amalek.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Samuel said, “Why then do you ask me, since the LORD has
departed from you and has become your adversary? “The LORD has done accordingly
as He spoke through me; for the LORD has torn the kingdom out of your hand and
given it to your neighbor, to David. “As you did not obey the LORD and did not
execute His fierce wrath on Amalek, so the LORD has done this thing to you this
day.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Samuel 28:16-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Samuel 28:19, notice that Saul and his sons would be
in Paradise with God. They will lose the battle. They were believers.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Moreover the LORD will also give over Israel along with you
into the hands of the Philistines, therefore tomorrow you and your sons will be
with me. Indeed the LORD will give over the army of Israel into the hands of
the Philistines!”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Samuel 28:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Saul, in 1 Samuel 31:4, died the next day by suicide.

of suicide too.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Saul said to his armor bearer, “Draw your sword and
pierce me through with it, otherwise these uncircumcised will come and pierce
me through and make sport of me.” But his armor bearer would not, for he was
greatly afraid. So Saul took his sword and fell on it.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Samuel
31:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Demon Possession and Drug Use</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Demon possession of the unbeliever is related to the use
of mind-altering drugs. These are not the drugs or medications prescribed by
doctors, but illicit recreational drug use resulting in drug addiction. The
Greek word <span lang=EL>φαρμακός</span> (pharmakos) is our English word for
pharmacy. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Greek word <span lang=EL>φαρμακία</span> (pharmakia)
primarily signified the use of medicine, drugs, spells, poisoning. But in Galatians
5:20, Revelation 9:21, and Revelation 18:23, “sorcery” is <span lang=EL>φαρμακία</span>
(pharmakia) refers to witchcraft. Drug addiction includes mind release where
there is little to no control over the mind and has destructive qualities. Demon
possession in the Tribulation will also be connected with drug addiction. </p>

<p class=Verses>“idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of
anger, disputes, dissensions, factions,” (Galatians 5:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and they did not repent of their murders nor of their
sorceries nor of their immorality nor of their thefts.” (Revelation 9:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and the light of a lamp will not shine in you any longer; and
the voice of the bridegroom and bride will not be heard in you any longer; for
your merchants were the great men of the earth, because all the nations were
deceived by your sorcery.” (Revelation 18:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Vines, “Dictionary of New Testament Words:” In
sorcery, the use of drugs, whether simple or potent, was generally accompanied
by incantations and appeals to occult powers, with the provision of various
charms, amulets, etc., professedly designed to keep the applicant or patient
from the attention and power of demons, but actually to impress the applicant
with the mysterious resources and powers of the sorcerer. page 52, vol. 4.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Exodus 7:11, Exodus 7:22, Exodus 8:7, and Exodus 8:18 “magicians”
is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>חרטם</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(charṭôm) and
refers to demon possessed men.  </p>

<p class=Verses> “Then Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers,
and they also, the magicians of Egypt, did the same with their secret arts.”
(Exodus 7:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The magicians did the same with their secret arts, making
frogs come up on the land of Egypt.” (Exodus 8:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Isaiah 47:9 and Isaiah 47:12, “sorceries” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>כּשׁף</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(kesheph) and means sorcery, witchcraft. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But these two things will come on you suddenly in one
day: Loss of children and widowhood. They will come on you in full measure In
spite of your many sorceries, In spite of the great power of your spells.”
(Isaiah 47:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Stand fast now in your spells And in your many sorceries
With which you have labored from your youth; Perhaps you will be able to
profit, Perhaps you may cause trembling.” (Isaiah 47:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 16:16, “divination” is related to the Greek words
<span lang=EL>πυ</span>́<span lang=EL>θων</span> (puthōn) and <span lang=EL>μαντευ</span>́<span
lang=EL>ομαι</span> (manteuomai) which mean to divine, to practice divination
from <span lang=EL>μάντις</span> (mantis), a seer, or diviner. The word is
allied to <span lang=EL>μαίνομαι</span> (mantomai), to rave, and <span lang=EL>μόνια</span>
(monia), fury displayed by those who were possessed by evil spirits,
represented by the pagan god or goddess, while delivering their messages from
an oracle. </p>

<p class=Verses>“It happened that as we were going to the place of prayer, a
slave-girl having a spirit of divination met us, who was bringing her masters
much profit by fortune-telling.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 16:16, NASB)</p>
