<h2>Divine Institutions, Genesis to Lamentations</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Genesis</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divine Institutions: Gen. 2, Gen. 3, Gen. 4, and Gen. 9
through Gen. 11. Volition, marriage, family, nationalism. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Exodus</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Law structure given to facilitate the execution of
the four divine institutions. Exod. 1 through Exod. 24. The Tabernacle given to
enable the proper worship functions of Israel as a nation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Leviticus</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The four Divine Institutions seen in: Volition in
personal observance of sacrifices. Marriage demonstrated by strict laws
governing the marriage institution. Family evidenced by a strict,
well-structured system for family living and functioning. Nationalism seen in
the military system, justice system, and power structure.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Numbers</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The four Divine Institutions seen in: Volition - Negative
volition and its consequence - refusal to enter the Land. Marriage - challenged
by the doctrine of Balaam. Num 25. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Deuteronomy</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The four Divine Institutions seen in:  Challenge to
volition of new generation in Deut. 1-6. Challenges to marriage, family and
nationalism. Deut. 11:18-19. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You shall therefore impress these words of mine on your
heart and on your soul; and you shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and
they shall be as frontals on your forehead. &quot;You shall teach them to your
sons, talking of them when you sit in your house and when you walk along the
road and when you lie down and when you rise up.” (Deuteronomy 11:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Joshua</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The four Divine Institutions seen in: Volition - Joshua
example of positive volition; Achan example of negative volition. Nationalism -
exemplified by all tribes working together in the conquest on west of Jordan
before any could settle on the east. Joshua 1:14-17. National discipline seen
in the command to totally destroy the nations in Canaan. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle shall
remain in the land which Moses gave you beyond the Jordan, but you shall cross
before your brothers in battle array, all your valiant warriors, and shall help
them, until the LORD gives your brothers rest, as He gives you, and they also
possess the land which the LORD your God is giving them. Then you shall return
to your own land, and possess that which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you
beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise.&quot; They answered Joshua, saying,
&quot;All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we
will go. &quot;Just as we obeyed Moses in all things, so we will obey you; only
may the LORD your God be with you as He was with Moses.” (Joshua 1:14-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Judges</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The four Divine Institutions seen in:  Classic example of
negative volition on national level Judges 1 and 2. Violation of marriage
instituted by intermarriage concept. Violation of family in failure to teach
doctrine to the children. First, second and third cycles of discipline
expressed upon Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Ruth</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The four Divine Institutions seen in:  Classic example of
positive volition. Classic example of Divine Institution of Marriage. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>1 Samuel</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The four Divine Institutions seen in:  Classic example of
negative volition with Israel’s rejection of the immediate rule of God in their
midst. 1 Samuel 8:19. Classic example of failure in nationalism. 1 Samuel 17.
Principle of National Discipline - continued harassment of Israel by
Philistines. King Saul commits suicide. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Nevertheless, the people refused to listen to the voice of
Samuel, and they said, &quot;No, but there shall be a king over us,” (1 Samuel
8:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>2 Samuel</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The four Divine Institutions seen in:  Development of the
principle of nationalism. Israel becomes large, great and powerful under David.
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>1 Kings</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The four Divine Institutions seen in:  Nationalism -
thrives under Solomon but broken after his death. The kingdom is divided. All
Divine Institutions under fire and in weakened state. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>2 Kings</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Five cycles of discipline administered to the Northern
Kingdom by 726 BC. The first four cycles of discipline administered to the
Southern Kingdom by 726 BC. The fifth cycle of discipline administered to the
Southern Kingdom by 586 BC. Divine Institution of Nationalism very weak with corruption,
graft, and timidity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>1 Chronicles and 2 Chronicles</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divine Institutions - emphasis on same period as the
Kings but on the fruits and blessing of  4 Divine Institutions, especially
under David’s dominion. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Five cycles of Discipline - Chronicles ends with both the
Northern Kingdom and the Southern Kingdom in captivity, North to Assyria, South
to Babylon.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Ezra</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Five cycles of discipline - emphasis on Southern Kingdom returning
from the 5th cycle and rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem, rebuilding the Temple
and establishing the principle of nationalism. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Nehemiah</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divine Institutions: Classic example of nationalistic
spirit in Nehemiah. Classic example of positive volition by returning Jews in
building wall under great adversity and hardships. Judah returning from 5th
cycle after 70 years of captivity. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Esther</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divine Institutions: Volition – Esther 1, King’s
volition-human viewpoint toward Vashti;  Esther 2, King’s volition--toward
Esther; Esther 3 and Esther 6, volition by Haman toward Mordecai. Nationalism -
Esther 4, Jewish nationalistic, principle; Esther 8 and Esther 9, nationalism
(Jewish) honored; Esther 10, nationalism principle victorious. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Job</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divine Institutions: Volition – positive volition, Job
accepting initial suffering without mental attitude sins. Marriage - Job’s wife
provides negative volition to challenge to him. Family - taken from Job in
underserved suffering for him and deserved for them.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Psalms</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Ecclesiastes</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Divine Institutions would come into focus
immediately. Volition is seen in the choice of the details of life over the
truth of doctrine communicated by David and Bathsheba. Marriage is one of the
big problems in the life of Solomon. God had told Solomon not to multiply wives
and he did it anyway. Family doesn’t come into view directly in the book, but
any distortion of volition or marriage within a man’s life would greatly affect
the family. Nationalism under Solomon’s reign prospered, but at his death the
obvious result of the dividing of the nation into Israel in the north and Judah
in the south evidenced the internal instability even though the prosperity
seemed at an all-time high.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Song of Solomon</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Divine Institutions: The proper exercise of volition
is evident by the Shulammite woman in rejecting Solomon’s advances. The Divine
Institution of Marriage is one of the foremost in the book. The problems of
misunderstanding within a family and inter-family relationships come out with
the book. With respect to Nationalism, there is no real issue here as it is
person-centered rather than nation-centered.</p>
