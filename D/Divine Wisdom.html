<h2><a name="_D-Divorce_and_Remarriage"></a><a name="_D-Divorce"></a>Divine
Wisdom</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God's Grace System for Gaining Wisdom</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The grace apparatus for perception is God's grace system
of spiritual comprehension empowered by the filling of God the Holy Spirit where
the Holy Spirit controls the soul of the believer. The Holy Spirit’s power enables
the believer to understand, learn, and apply the whole realm of Bible doctrine,
the Word of God, regardless of the level of human intelligence or education. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Learning the Word and understanding it depends upon who
and what Jesus Christ is, not who and what we are. He has provided everything
necessary for taking in the Word and converting it to applicable <i>epignosis</i>
doctrine or divine wisdom. The grace apparatus for perception was designed by
God the Father in eternity past for each of us to grow spiritually and fulfill
the plan of God for our lives. This grace system allows the believer to
progressively gain in believed spiritual knowledge or divine wisdom which is <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the soul. Eph. 3:16-19; Job 32:8. See
category on the <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/G/Grace%20Apparatus%20For%20Perception.html">Grace Apparatus for Perception</a>.
</p>

<p class=Verses>“that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory,
to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inner man, so that
Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; and that you, being rooted and
grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the
breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ which
surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God.”
(Ephesians 3:16-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But it is a spirit in man, And the breath of the
Almighty gives them understanding.” (Job 32:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Value of Divine Wisdom</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 2:1, “receive” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>לקח</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(lâqach) and means to be taken in marriage, to
conceive, to be impregnated, to become pregnant. This is a metaphor for
positive volition in receiving the Word of God. The word “treasure” means to
store up. Bible doctrine is stored up in the right lobe of the soul. For
spiritual knowledge or divine wisdom to be stored up and to be of current
value, there must be a concentration upon it. </p>

<p class=Verses>“My son, if you will receive my words And treasure my
commandments within you,” (Proverbs 2:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 2:2, the word “attentive” means to cause to
attend, to pay attention to or concentrate on. For divine wisdom to be
received, concentrated upon, believed and applied, opportunity for it to reach
you must be provided. This comes from several Hebrew words. The word “incline”
refers to inclining one’s heart or right lobe of the soul to God’s Word. It
means to extend the hand, or the rod, or the scepter. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Make your ear attentive to wisdom, Incline your heart to
understanding;” (Proverbs 2:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 2:3, The word “cry” means to call or read
aloud, to proclaim. It means to verbally express need for Bible doctrine. An
example is that is the believer attending every Bible class taught at the local
church, requesting recordings of past Bible lessons, and printed and electronic
doctrinal literature. For divine wisdom to be taken in personally, there must
be the mechanics by which that spiritual knowledge is communicated. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For if you cry for discernment, Lift your voice for
understanding;” (Proverbs 2:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Proverbs 2:4 indicates these mechanics or process of
learning Bible doctrine is the grace apparatus for perception. “Seek” means
seeking to find. There are many ways you can seek something. For example, you
can seek to destroy, seek to injure, seek to help, or seek to find. Here the
last is in view. The Hebrew word for “search” means to search or dig for. This
emphasizes the process by which something is found or taken in. This is the
study of the Word of God.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If you seek her as silver And search for her as for hidden
treasures; Then you will discern the fear of the LORD And discover the
knowledge of God.” (Proverbs 2:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Just as a vaccine allows your immune system to guard your
body from infection from viruses and bacteria, divine wisdom in the soul and
the filling of the Holy Spirit will guard your soul. Divine wisdom equips your
soul with the application of the Word of God so you can handle the crisis or
disaster when it strikes.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The life benefit of Bible doctrine in your soul is seen
in Proverbs 2:9 with several words in the Hebrew. “You will discern” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>בּין</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(bı̂yn) and means to know in the mind, to
distinguish, to discern, to understand. There are several areas where
discernment is very important – righteousness and justice.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then you will discern righteousness and justice And equity and
every good course.” (Proverbs 2:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 2:9, “righteousness” is <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>צדק</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(tsedeq) and means what is ethically
right. To be ethical as defined by Webster is to conform to professional
standards of conduct, or moral values and duties. “Justice” is <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>משׁפּט</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(mishpâṭ) and means the act of deciding
a case by applying the ordinances of written law. This is done by making the
proper decisions regarding one’s rights and privileges. It also means that the
believer should self-evaluate their own spiritual fitness and their ability to
make informed and objective decisions based on the divine wisdom in their soul
– the very thinking of Jesus Christ. 1 Cor. 2:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT
HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.” (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One of the practical benefits of <i>epignosis</i> Bible
doctrine or divine wisdom in the right lobe of the soul is that the believer
will have understanding or discernment as to ethically good and proper decision
making. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 2:9, “equity” means uprightness in an ethical
sense. The major benefit of <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the soul is
realized in a crisis or disaster. The major impact of doctrine may only have
“human values” seemingly when taken in. But, later in the Angelic Conflict,
they take on great spiritual vigor in combating the enemy. “Good course” means
a good moral course of action in life. Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the
soul and the filling of the Holy Spirit assists you in the full utilization of
the four divine institutions in your life. See category on <a
href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/D/Divine%20Institutions.html">Divine Institutions</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 2:10, “pleasant to your soul” means
delightful. There will be a full enjoyment and an emotional soul response to
Bible doctrine. It will give capacity for life. They will bring their present
benefits to the believer, but most of all, they will ward off the potential
dangers of sin and involvement with evil. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For wisdom will enter your heart And knowledge will be
pleasant to your soul;” (Proverbs 2:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 2:11, “discretion” means the power of
purpose. The purpose laid down by Bible doctrine will be a constant guard to
keep you on the correct spiritual course that God intends for your life.
“Understanding” is <i>epignosis</i> knowledge not just heard, but understood,
believed and being applied. This is divine wisdom being applied to life’s
situations.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Discretion will guard you, Understanding will watch over you,”
(Proverbs 2:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 2:12, your purpose and divine wisdom will
deliver you. “Deliver” means to snatch away from the evil man. You will be
snatched away from the person speaking perverse things. God will deliver you by
your purpose and divine wisdom from the perverse speech of others. You will not
be sucked in by their speech. </p>

<p class=Verses>“To deliver you from the way of evil, From the man who speaks
perverse things;” (Proverbs 2:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Your guidelines will be a constant purpose that God has
planned for your life with the enabling power of the Holy Spirit to enable you
to think objectively and apply divine wisdom. Divine wisdom in the soul will
deliver you from the strange and adulterous woman. It will deliver you from the
foreigner or those who oppose God’s plan. Therefore, two obstacles that <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine guards the spiritually advancing believer from are evil men and
women. Prov. 2:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“To deliver you from the strange woman, From the adulteress who
flatters with her words;” (Proverbs 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Benefits of Divine Wisdom </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Proverbs 3:1-2 states the benefits of divine wisdom in
terms of a long life and peace, health, and prosperity. </p>

<p class=Verses>“My son, do not forget my teaching, But let your heart keep my
commandments; For length of days and years of life And peace they will add to
you.” (Proverbs 3:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Proverbs 3:3-4 indicates that within your life on earth,
you will have favor and acceptance in the sight of men. This is a grace
appreciation, a kindness to you, goodwill to you, and a good response in
answering you. Doctrine does not turn you into a freak or a phony. It molds you
into a genuine person, free from a facade of self-righteousness. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Do not let kindness and truth leave you; Bind them around your
neck, Write them on the tablet of your heart. So you will find favor and good
repute In the sight of God and man.” (Proverbs 3:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Proverbs 3:5-6 indicates that divine wisdom will have a
twofold influence. It promotes trust in the Lord. It gives a negative attitude
to human viewpoint. Bible doctrine in the soul promises God’s direction of the
course and fortunes of your life. “Make your paths straight” means to make
successful, make smooth or straight, free from obstacles. Paths are the courses
and fortunes of life.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Trust in the LORD with all your heart And do not lean on your
own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He will make your
paths straight.” (Proverbs 3:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Bible doctrine will take you from the babe on to
spiritual maturity. In Proverbs 3:7-8, “healing to your body” means Bible
doctrine provides sustenance for the whole person. “Bones” means that divine
wisdom provides refreshment to one’s whole person.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Do not be wise in your own eyes; Fear the LORD and turn
away from evil. It will be healing to your body And refreshment to your
bones.&quot;  (Proverbs 3:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Proverbs 3:9-10 indicates that Bible doctrine brings
personal prosperity. “Honor” in the Hebrew is in the piel of <span dir=RTL></span><span
dir=RTL><span dir=RTL></span> </span><span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>כּבד</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span>(kâbad) and
means to make honorable, to glorify. “Wealth” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>הון</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span>
(hôn) and means substance, wealth, sufficiency. “First” is <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>ראשׁית</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> (rê'shı̂yth) and means first fruits, the beginnings of one’s
increase. “Produce” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>תּבוּאה</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (tebû'âh) and means revenue, products
and yields. “Barns” are storehouses. “Filled” means prosperity coming out of
the seams. Plenty of good stuff. Luxury as well as necessities, wine vats
bursting at the seams. “New wine” as a sign of prosperity and as a valuable
product.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Honor the LORD from your wealth And from the first of all
your produce; So your barns will be filled with plenty And your vats will
overflow with new wine.&quot;  (Proverbs 3:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Prosperity and giving is related to the Word of God.
God’s Word outlines the teaching on giving and receiving. Giving must be kept
in its dispensational sphere. Giving must reflect a grace attitude toward God,
toward yourself, toward your substance. Blessing and prosperity does not come
by the mechanical procedure of giving a tenth, a twentieth or the whole thing,
first, second or last. Acts 5 is an example. Blessing and prosperity does not
come from great self-denial. 1 Cor. 13:1-3, Col. 2:21-23. See category on <a
href="#_D-Giving">Giving</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but do
not have love, I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have the
gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all
faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. And if I
give all my possessions to feed the poor, and if I surrender my body to be
burned, but do not have love, it profits me nothing.&quot;  (1 Corinthians
13:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch!&quot;
(which all refer to things destined to perish with use)—in accordance with the
commandments and teachings of men? These are matters which have, to be sure,
the appearance of wisdom in self-made religion and self-abasement and severe
treatment of the body, but are of no value against fleshly indulgence.&quot; 
(Colossians 2:21-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer is told in Proverbs 3:11 to not reject the
divine discipline that God brings to the believer who is out of fellowship. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;My son, do not reject the discipline of the LORD Or
loathe His reproof,&quot;  (Proverbs 3:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>James 4:17 tells us that when the <i>epignosis</i> Bible
doctrine in our souls tells us to do a right thing in a certain situation and
we refuse to do it, we have sinned. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore, to one who knows the right thing to do and
does not do it, to him it is sin.&quot;  (James 4:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divine discipline is real and can be severe. God
administers His discipline as proof that He loves us and will correct us as His
children as to the correct thinking and behavior. Prov. 3:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For whom the LORD loves He reproves, Even as a father corrects
the son in whom he delights.” (Proverbs 3:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 3:18, “happy” is in the plural and is
directly related to the one with <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine or divine
wisdom in their soul. Both inner and outer happiness are in vogue here. </p>

<p class=Verses>“She is a tree of life to those who take hold of her, And happy
are all who hold her fast.” (Proverbs 3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 3:21-22, “life” means earthly happiness,
combined with spiritual blessedness. “Soul” refers to the soul structure, life
in the soul toward God. Divine wisdom brings form and appearance to the
institution of parenthood. Divine wisdom enables the instruction to take shape,
and it brings order in appearance to what has been taught. Grace is form and
appearance. “Neck” is used figuratively of instruction by parents as ornaments
of the neck. It means that if accepted, sound wisdom and discretion will become
a part of you. </p>

<p class=Verses>“My son, let them not vanish from your sight; Keep sound wisdom
and discretion, So they will be life to your soul And adornment to your neck.”
(Proverbs 3:21-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Wisdom brings stability in life, not vacillation or
stumbling. Fear will be removed. Rest will be “sweet” as restlessness will be
quenched. Stability replaces the wanderlust. Prov. 3:23-24.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then you will walk in your way securely And your foot will not
stumble. When you lie down, you will not be afraid; When you lie down, your
sleep will be sweet.” (Proverbs 3:23-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Divine Wisdom Warns of the Enticement of Criminality </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual knowledge in the right lobe of the believer’s
soul forms a warning system for temptation or enticement that very often comes
from Satan’s world system surrounds us. The first step in the enticement
process is the enticement itself. Someone convincing tries to persuade you to
join them in the plan. In Proverbs 1:10, “entice” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>פָּתָה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(pathah) and is in the piel stem. This is
the initial staging ground. The plan and contents of the enticement are to get
you involved in the destruction of someone else. The plan of attack is to setup
an ambush. Ambushes are usually a relatively safe way to attack someone. You
simply catch the other person off guard and hit them when they least expect it.
Those enticing you will try to trivialize the dangers and exaggerate the gains
of the ambush. They will tell you that the chances of getting caught or hurt
are extremely low, almost non-existent. Prov. 1:10-15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“My son, if sinners entice you, Do not consent. If they say,
&quot;Come with us, Let us lie in wait for blood, Let us ambush the innocent
without cause; Let us swallow them alive like Sheol, Even whole, as those who
go down to the pit; We will find all kinds of precious wealth, We will fill our
houses with spoil; Throw in your lot with us, We shall all have one
purse,&quot; My son, do not walk in the way with them. Keep your feet from
their path,” (Proverbs 1:10-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The plan of attack always calls for security. It will all
be kept quiet. They will have to convince you that there is no danger in the
venture. The plan calls for an appeal of better things in life. The whole gang
will split the goods. All will share in the glory, the purse, the blessings.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 1:16, “their feet run to evil” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>רַע</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(ra) and means their feet run to injury, evil,
distress, misery, calamity, and adversity. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For their feet run to evil And they hasten to shed blood.”
(Proverbs 1:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They are greedy for gain by violence. This is their true
ruthless character. They will ambush their own lives by what they do. Prov.
1:18-19. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But they lie in wait for their own blood; They ambush their
own lives. So are the ways of everyone who gains by violence; It takes away the
life of its possessors.” (Proverbs 1:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divine wisdom from Bible doctrine in the soul should be
ringing alarm bells about now. This is a warning of their tactics. Their plan
should bring a strong warning from doctrine. There is also a warning in God's
divine discipline because of your negative volition. Prov. 1:24-25.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Because I called and you refused, I stretched out my
hand and no one paid attention; And you neglected all my counsel And did not
want my reproof;” (Proverbs 1:24-25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They will be exposed and scorned and you with them. All
involved with the plan will suffer severely. Prov. 1:26.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I will also laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your
dread comes,” (Proverbs 1:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If you go in
with them in their plan, you are rejecting the Bible doctrine in your soul.
That doctrine will be a reminder to you when you are caught and punished. All
involved will have a terrifying fear which will render them unfit for action.
This fear will come upon everyone involved like a devastating storm. You will
be distressed and full of dread. You will have this severe distress combined
with personal pressures. Prov. 1:27.</p>

<p class=Verses>“When your dread comes like a storm And your calamity comes
like a whirlwind, When distress and anguish come upon you.” (Proverbs 1:27,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The cause for the divine discipline is that <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine or knowledge was not heeded when the temptation appeared. You
went negative to your knowledge of Bible doctrine. In Proverbs 1:29-30, “they
hated knowledge” is human hatred for the perception of Bible doctrine. This is
rejection of Bible doctrine already understood and believed. They “spurned all
my reproof” refers to despising God divine discipline and spurning God’s plan
for your life. This is reversionism. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/QR/Reversionism.html">Reversionism</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Because they hated knowledge And did not choose the fear of
the LORD. &quot;They would not accept my counsel, They spurned all my reproof.”
(Proverbs 1:29-30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is always blessing and spiritual growth to
believers who heed and apply Bible doctrine to a temptation situation. They
will be at ease, undisturbed by ill fortune and will be secure with God as
their refuge. They will not be terrified and will always be spiritually
equipped for action in the Angelic Conflict and in facing life’s challenges and
temptations. Prov. 1:33.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But he who listens to me shall live securely And will be
at ease from the dread of evil.&quot;” (Proverbs 1:33, NASB)</p>
