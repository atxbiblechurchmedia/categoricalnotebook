<h2><a name="_Daily_Intake_of"></a>Daily Intake of Bible Doctrine</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers in the early Church were involved in evangelism
in the temple. The result was daily salvation and an adding to the Church those
that were saved. For the local church, you have it functioning within the
confines of the temple and in the sphere of evangelism. Acts 2:46.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Day by day continuing with one mind in the temple, and
breaking bread from house to house, they were taking their meals together with
gladness and sincerity of heart,” (Acts 2:46, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This was the evangelistic ministry of the apostles,
preaching the Gospel in the temple on a daily basis and also in every house.
The house here would not refer to the “church” otherwise you would have a
multiplicity of churches all over the city. This again is in the context of
evangelism. Acts 5:42.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And every day, in the temple and from house to house, they
kept right on teaching and preaching Jesus as the Christ.” (Acts 5:42, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The context for this daily searching of the Scripture was
the Jewish synagogue, which met weekly on Saturday and involved unbelieving
Jews from the synagogue going home and daily studying their Old Testament
Scriptures to determine the accuracy of the Gospel message being preached to
them in their synagogue. The context is again evangelism. Acts 17:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The brethren immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to
Berea, and when they arrived, they went into the synagogue of the Jews.” (Acts
17:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 6:1, we have the daily ministration of the
deacons. This is in the context of production on a daily basis to relieve the
communicators from details in the teaching of believers. It would seem quite
obvious from the passage that the ministry of these men would take them from
the actual ministry of the apostles at least on a partial basis, but resulted
in the facilitating of the growth of the congregation.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now at this time while the disciples were increasing in
number, a complaint arose on the part of the Hellenistic Jews against the
native Hebrews, because their widows were being overlooked in the daily serving
of food.” (Acts 6:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 3:13, the meaning must be looked at closely
from the Greek text. An actual translation is “But encourage yourselves
according to the standard of each day.” The verb “encourage” is a present
active imperative of <span lang=EL>παρακαλε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(parakaleō). One must, therefore, isolate who is doing the encouraging. There
are three options.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But encourage one another day after day, as long as it is
still called &quot;Today,&quot; so that none of you will be hardened by the
deceitfulness of sin.” (Hebrews 3:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If Hebrews was written to pastors in Jerusalem, then you
would have the pastors encouraging themselves. It is in the active voice so
they would have to be producing the action. The translation “one another” is
not correct because this is the plural form of the reflexive pronoun “myself.”
The second plural form means “yourselves.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If it was written to the congregation referring to being
taught by someone else, it would have to be in the passive voice. In other
words, “be encouraged daily” thus, receiving the action of the verb. This is
not the case.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What then does it mean to “encourage yourselves according
to the standard of a day?” It refers to the daily application of Bible doctrine
on a personal basis. This is done, present tense, on a continual basis. The
active voice means the believer does it volitionally. The imperative mood means
this is his commanded responsibility.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 10:25, the believer is exhorted to not forsake
the assembling of themselves. The word “forsaking” is a present active
participle, which would indicate “not having as a practice of principle of
life, the forsaking of the assembling.” The word for assembling means the
“meeting of the church.”</p>

<p class=Verses>“not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of
some, but encouraging one another; and all the more as you see the day drawing
near.” (Hebrews 10:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The word <span lang=EL>ε</span>̔<span lang=EL>αυτου</span>͂
(heautou) is a reflexive pronoun used in the genitive case as a genitive of
reference. It modifies the “assembling together” to emphasize not neglecting or
forsaking their own meetings or assemblies.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A literal translation: “Not neglecting, as a continual
principle of life, their own meetings.” The word or phrase “but encouraging one
another” is a present active participle. A literal translation: “but you
(plural) keep encouraging continually and so much more as you seeing the day
continually drawing near.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Romans 14:5-6 relates to the esteem given to a day or
days. It is in the context of doubtful things not defined in Scripture. A literal
translation: “For who on the one hand judges a day from a day, who judges every
day; each in his own mind fully persuaded.” The meaning of <span lang=EL>πληροφορε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (plērophoreō) is to be fully convinced. This is a present
middle imperative, a permissive imperative of a third person singular.
Translation: “let him be.” It is the middle voice indicative that he persuades
himself. The present tense means it is continual action.</p>

<p class=Verses>“One person regards one day above another, another regards
every day alike. Each person must be fully convinced in his own mind. He who
observes the day, observes it for the Lord, and he who eats, does so for the
Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he who eats not, for the Lord he does not
eat, and gives thanks to God.” (Romans 14:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The context is how to relate Christian principles that
you have with other believers who have different norms and standards of life.
The criteria of the evaluation of a day or days is whether you are fully
convinced in your own mind. In Proverbs 27:1, the daily concept relates to a
person’s security. We have no security beyond “today.” This is also borne out
by James 4:14-15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do not boast about tomorrow, For you do not know what a day
may bring forth.” (Proverbs 27:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow. You
are just a vapor that appears for a little while and then vanishes away.
Instead, you ought to say, &quot;If the Lord wills, we will live and also do
this or that.&quot;” (James 4:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians, we have three basic references to the
matter of assembling in the local church. The first is found in 1 Corinthians 11:17-22
where the love feast had been distorted. It had preceded the communion service
and ruined all possibilities for an orderly and doctrinally conducted Lord’s
Supper memorial.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Secondly, the assembly of the local church occurs as the
context to the warning of women speaking in the church. 1 Cor. 14:34-35.
Thirdly, the assembly of the local church is implied in the laying aside of
money in the matter of spiritual grace giving. 1 Cor. 16:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The women are to keep silent in the churches; for they are not
permitted to speak, but are to subject themselves, just as the Law also says.
If they desire to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home; for
it is improper for a woman to speak in church.” (1 Corinthians 14:34-35, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I directed
the churches of Galatia, so do you also. On the first day of every week each
one of you is to put aside and save, as he may prosper, so that no collections
be made when I come.” (1 Corinthians 16:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 4:16, we have the reference to the
inward man being renewed “day by day.” The context is that of Paul reflecting
on his ministry with their struggles and pressures. This is the daily
sustainment principle.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore we do not lose heart, but though our outer man is
decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day.” (2 Corinthians 4:16,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 11:28, the Apostle Paul had daily
pressure and concern for all the churches. This does not denote “daily
function.” This emphasizes the daily burden, pressure, and concern that a
communicator feels for those to whom he ministers. This daily concern is a
characteristic of a mature communicator. A literal translation of 2 Corinthians
11:28 is; “Apart from the unmentioned daily pressure on me which is according
to a day, the concern about all the churches.”</p>

<p class=Verses>“Apart from such external things, there is the daily pressure
on me of concern for all the churches.” (2 Corinthians 11:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Thessalonians 2:9, Paul’s ministry functions as an
evangelist and as an apostle in the establishing of the local church in
Thessalonica. It would be an evangelistic and confirming type of ministry and
the length of it, approximately 21 days, based on the three Sabbath concept of
Acts 17:2. This would be an intensive block ministry on a limited basis.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For you recall, brethren, our labor and hardship, how working
night and day so as not to be a burden to any of you, we proclaimed to you the
gospel of God.” (1 Thessalonians 2:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And according to Paul's custom, he went to them, and for three
Sabbaths reasoned with them from the Scriptures,” (Acts 17:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Thessalonians 2:9, the word “recall” is the present
active indicative of <span lang=EL>μνημονευ</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(mnēmoneuō) and means you keep recalling. “Labor” is <span lang=EL>κο</span>́<span
lang=EL>πος</span> (kopos) and means to become wearied and tired, labor which
renders exhausted. “Hardship” is <span lang=EL>μο</span>́<span lang=EL>χθος</span>
(mochthos) and means labor, exertion and hardship. This was an intensive
section given over to an uninterrupted ministry to their needs, evangelism, and
confirmation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Working” is a present middle participle of <span
lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>ργα</span>́<span lang=EL>ζομαι</span>
(ergazomai) meaning that Paul as the communicator was actively engaged in
working out his ministry with them and as a result would enjoy the fruit in
their lives. The participle indicates it was a principle of his life to do
this.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Thessalonians 3:10 is the prayer ministry of Paul
where he relates the face to face concept with the matter of the spiritual growth
of the Thessalonians.</p>

<p class=Verses>“as we night and day keep praying most earnestly that we may
see your face, and may complete what is lacking in your faith?” (1
Thessalonians 3:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>2 Thessalonians 3:7-10 involves working to sustain the
ministry of the Apostle Paul. This would not be applicable to a pastor, but was
operative here for the Apostle Paul. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example,
because we did not act in an undisciplined manner among you, nor did we eat
anyone's bread without paying for it, but with labor and hardship we kept
working night and day so that we would not be a burden to any of you; not
because we do not have the right to this, but in order to offer ourselves as a
model for you, so that you would follow our example. For even when we were with
you, we used to give you this order: if anyone is not willing to work, then he
is not to eat, either.” (2 Thessalonians 3:7-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 Timothy 5:4-5 presents the qualifications of true
widowhood. A true widow is eligible for help from the local church when she “has
been left alone, has fixed her hope on God and continues in entreaties and
prayers night and day.” The daily ministry of prayer is enjoined upon the true
doctrinal widow.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but if any widow has children or grandchildren, they must
first learn to practice piety in regard to their own family and to make some
return to their parents; for this is acceptable in the sight of God. Now she
who is a widow indeed and who has been left alone, has fixed her hope on God
and continues in entreaties and prayers night and day.” (1 Timothy 5:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The principle of daily teaching as a responsibility of a
communicator. All responsibilities of a communicator are directly related to
his growth and maturity. 1 Timothy 3:6 indicates that it is dangerous to have a
novice in the ministry as pastor. It continues by giving the maturity
qualifications of a deacon in 1 Timothy 3:1-13 and Titus 1:5-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and not a new convert, so that he will not become conceited
and fall into the condemnation incurred by the devil.” (1 Timothy 3:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Daily teaching was the normal practice of the mature
apostle in the New Testament. 1 Thess. 2:9; Acts 2:42-47; Acts 5:21; Acts 5:25;
Acts 11:26; Acts 28:30-31,; Acts 19:9-10; Acts 6:3-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For you recall, brethren, our labor and hardship, how working
night and day so as not to be a burden to any of you, we proclaimed to you the
gospel of God.” (1 Thessalonians 2:9, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“But someone came and reported to them, &quot;The men whom you
put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people!&quot;” (Acts
5:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Therefore, brethren, select from among you seven men of
good reputation, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may put in charge of
this task. &quot;But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of
the word.&quot;” (Acts 6:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Daily teaching was the normal practice of the Lord in His
earthly ministry. Matt. 26:55. </p>

<p class=Verses>“At that time Jesus said to the crowds, &quot;Have you come out
with swords and clubs to arrest Me as you would against a robber? Every day I
used to sit in the temple teaching and you did not seize Me.” (Matthew 26:55,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>These are the principles of taking in of the Word daily under
verbal communication to the assembled believers. There are many principles
involved. This was the fare of the Thessalonian believers during a special
evangelistic and Bible conference beginning. This would be the special block
conference type daily ministry lasting three weeks. 1 Thess. 2:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For you recall, brethren, our labor and hardship, how working
night and day so as not to be a burden to any of you, we proclaimed to you the
gospel of God.” (1 Thessalonians 2:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This was the fare of those in the school of Tyrannus for
a space of two years under the daily teaching of Paul. Acts 19:9-10. This was
the daily practice of the new believers in Acts 2:42-47 to meet daily in the
temple for evangelism, fellowship, communion and prayer.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But when some were becoming hardened and disobedient, speaking
evil of the Way before the people, he withdrew from them and took away the
disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus. This took place for two
years, so that all who lived in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and
Greeks.” (Acts 19:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“They were continually devoting themselves to the apostles'
teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. Everyone
kept feeling a sense of awe; and many wonders and signs were taking place
through the apostles. And all those who had believed were together and had all
things in common; and they began selling their property and possessions and
were sharing them with all, as anyone might have need. Day by day continuing
with one mind in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they were
taking their meals together with gladness and sincerity of heart, praising God
and having favor with all the people. And the Lord was adding to their number
day by day those who were being saved.” (Acts 2:42-47, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This was the daily fare of the believers under the
teaching of the apostles in Acts 6. Unless the apostles were teaching daily, it
would not have been necessary to appoint the deacons to handle the daily
ministry to the widows in Acts 6:1-2. The context makes it clear that these
ministries were going on simultaneously. Acts 6:1-8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now at this time while the disciples were increasing in
number, a complaint arose on the part of the Hellenistic Jews against the
native Hebrews, because their widows were being overlooked in the daily serving
of food. So the twelve summoned the congregation of the disciples and said,
&quot;It is not desirable for us to neglect the word of God in order to serve
tables.” (Acts 6:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The principle of daily assembly taking in the Word is a
common sense principle in the Word. God provided manna for the nation Israel on
a daily basis. This was an individual volitional matter and received
instruction from Moses on how to conserve their manna. There was a volitional
expression in the eating. This is analogous to making personal application.
Exodus 16:4; Exodus 16:14-22; Exodus 16:24.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD said to Moses, &quot;Behold, I will rain bread
from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a day's portion
every day, that I may test them, whether or not they will walk in My
instruction.” (Exodus 16:4, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“When the layer of dew evaporated, behold, on the surface of
the wilderness there was a fine flake-like thing, fine as the frost on the
ground. When the sons of Israel saw it, they said to one another, &quot;What is
it?&quot; For they did not know what it was. And Moses said to them, &quot;It
is the bread which the LORD has given you to eat.” (Exodus 16:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So they put it aside until morning, as Moses had ordered, and
it did not become foul nor was there any worm in it.” (Exodus 16:24, NASB)</p>
