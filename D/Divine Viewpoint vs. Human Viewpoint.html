<h2><a name="_D-Divine_Viewpoint_vs."></a><a name="_Divine_Viewpoint_vs."></a>Divine
Viewpoint vs. Human Viewpoint </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divine viewpoint is not a warmed over version of the
power of positive thinking. This is a biblical technique for believers only. It
has to do with the believer who is filled with the Holy Spirit and thinking
based on the Bible doctrine in the right lobe of their soul. It is thinking
with the mind of Jesus Christ. It is “looking unto Jesus, the author and
finisher of our faith.” 1 Cor. 2:16; Heb. 12:2. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT
HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.” (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of
faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame,
and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.&quot;  (Hebrews 12:2,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Occupation with Christ is for believers only.<b> </b>Believers
are what they think. This opens the whole realm of mental attitudes. Proverbs
23:7 says that believers are what they think in the right lobe of their souls.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For as he thinks within himself, so he is. He says to
you, &quot;Eat and drink!&quot; But his heart is not with you.&quot;  (Proverbs
23:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A believer’s physical appearance and success depends upon
what they think. Often people equate a tough person with a profane vocabulary
or someone with a strong physical stature, but toughness is a mental attitude.
You are not beaten until you give up mentally. This was illustrated by the
American soldiers in the Korean War. Some of them had “give-up-itis.” They had
no desire to live and if left alone, in 24 to 48 hours they were dead.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are two ways of thinking - divine viewpoint and
human viewpoint. The believer needs mental attitude divine viewpoint and cannot
get it without the communication of Bible doctrine. The Christian public has
stopped thinking because they have stopped studying the Word of God. It is
interesting that when Christians habitually attend Bible class and the regular
services where the Word is faithfully taught, they learn to concentrate, to
think, and to stabilize. Isaiah 55:7-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Let the wicked forsake his way And the unrighteous man his
thoughts; And let him return to the LORD, And He will have compassion on him,
And to our God, For He will abundantly pardon. &quot;For My thoughts are not
your thoughts, Nor are your ways My ways,&quot; declares the LORD. &quot;For as
the heavens are higher than the earth, So are My ways higher than your ways And
My thoughts than your thoughts.” (Isaiah 55:7-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When an individual accepts Christ as Savior, how much
divine viewpoint do they have in their right lobe? A mustard seed of divine
viewpoint. The spiritually mature believer who has developed a large frame of
reference through Bible doctrine intake and application has displaced much of
their pre-salvation human viewpoint with divine viewpoint. Learning and
applying Bible doctrine has renewed their soul and their thinking. 2 Cor. 4:16;
Eph. 4:22-23; Col. 3:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore we do not lose heart, but though our outer man
is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day.&quot;  (2
Corinthians 4:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;that, in reference to your former manner of life, you lay
aside the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of
deceit, and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind,&quot;  (Ephesians
4:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and have put on the new self who is being renewed to a
true knowledge according to the image of the One who created him—&quot; 
(Colossians 3:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You need divine viewpoint to please God. Human viewpoint
never pleases God, no matter how cultured or intelligent the thinking might be.
The unbeliever has only human viewpoint and believes they must work for what
they get. The harder they work, the more they get. The believer knows that they
are saved by grace and they keep walking after salvation on a non-meritorious
system called “faith.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Only Source of Divine Viewpoint is the Bible</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 Corinthians 2:16 tells us that the Bible is the mind of
Christ. Therefore, we must know the Word to know His mind and apply it to
realize His will. Religion does not agree with the above statement. Remember,
Christianity is not a religion, but a personal grace relationship with the Lord
Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL
INSTRUCT HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Word of God is a critic of the thoughts and intents
of the inner life. Our thinking must jibe with His thinking. We can’t have
inner soul peace without it. Heb. 4:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For the word of God is living and active and sharper than
any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of
both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the
heart.&quot;  (Hebrews 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Four Areas of Mental Attitude</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are four areas of mental attitude thinking –
worldliness, peace, giving, and stability.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Worldliness is not what you do. Worldliness is what you
think. The only answer to mental attitude worldliness is replacing human
viewpoint (worldliness) with divine viewpoint. One can have a beautiful outward
life as did the Pharisees, yet be completely shot through with human viewpoint.
You can be sitting in church and be worldly depending on what you are thinking.
The use of cosmetics or the lack of them does not make you worldly. It is what
you think regarding them. Rom. 12:2; Col. 3:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed
by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is,
that which is good and acceptable and perfect.&quot;  (Romans 12:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Set your mind on the things above, not on the things that
are on earth.&quot;  (Colossians 3:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Peace is a mental attitude. Peace is not laying down arms
and inviting some other foreign power to walk all over you. A relaxed mental
attitude of peace enables one to really enjoy the Christian walk regardless of
other people or circumstances. What do you do under pressure or when you get
upset? Do you use divine viewpoint, think it and apply it? You should be
relaxed and have an inner soul peace based on Bible doctrine resident in the
right lobe of your soul. Just as a good athlete is relaxed and calm before a
competition, so should the believer be in the Angelic Conflict. Isaiah 26:3;
Phil. 4:6-8.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;The steadfast of mind You will keep in perfect
peace, Because he trusts in You.&quot;  (Isaiah 26:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and
supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the
peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, will guard your hearts and
your minds in Christ Jesus. Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is
honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is
of good repute, if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise,
dwell on these things.&quot;  (Philippians 4:6-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Giving is a mental attitude. If the mental attitude is
not right, don’t give. Don’t give under pressure. Give with mental attitude of joy.
You can only have that when in fellowship! It’s the attitude that counts. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Stability is a mental attitude. A good illustration of
this is Robert E. Lee, a believer, at the Battle of Gettysburg. Disaster report
after disaster report came to his headquarters, but he remained calm and had
stability under pressure. He kept thinking. Adults who are cry-babies or have
mental attitude fear are always unstable. Stability is the ability to think
under pressure.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>David and Goliath Example</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Samuel 17:8-10, Goliath had come out each day for 40
days to say ”I defy the ranks of Israel.” The camp of Israel had status quo
fear. They were scared out of their wits. Even Jonathan who had had a great
victory in 1 Samuel 14 was scared. Goliath was 9’2” and was a fearful foe. His
chest protector alone weighed 143 pounds. His spear had a head on it heavier
than a shot-put (17 pounds). David came into the situation with perfect inner
peace and stability. Why? </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel and said to
them, &quot;Why do you come out to draw up in battle array? Am I not the
Philistine and you servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves and let him
come down to me. &quot;If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will
become your servants; but if I prevail against him and kill him, then you shall
become our servants and serve us.&quot; Again the Philistine said, &quot;I defy
the ranks of Israel this day; give me a man that we may fight
together.&quot;&quot;  (1 Samuel 17:8-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>David had courage and confidence in God’s promises in the
right lobe of his soul. He knew that the battle is the Lord’s. He had that
relaxed mental attitude that comes from knowing Bible doctrine. He had no
mental attitude fear when he ran to face Goliath and to kill him. 1 Sam.
17:46-47.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;This day the LORD will deliver you up into my
hands, and I will strike you down and remove your head from you. And I will
give the dead bodies of the army of the Philistines this day to the birds of
the sky and the wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may know that
there is a God in Israel, and that all this assembly may know that the LORD
does not deliver by sword or by spear; for the battle is the LORD'S and He will
give you into our hands.&quot;&quot;  (1 Samuel 17:46-47, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What is your fear? What do believers fear? It is fear of
death, loss of job, loss of health, loss of loved ones and so on? Your courage
and confidence should be based on the Bible doctrine in your soul. We should
learn Bible doctrine and stockpile divine viewpoint in the right lobe of our
souls.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Looking at life from divine viewpoint gives tremendous
stability and inner peace. The obstacles may be terrible and the pressure great,
but the believer “has access to the mind of Christ” which is the Word of God.
Let’s investigate divine viewpoint and human viewpoint in the area of respect
for authority. This makes a fascinating biblical study in that in America all
types of authority are flaunted and children seem to have little respect for
authority. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Respect For Authority</b></p>

For Authority</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Paul’s Demonstration of Human Viewpoint vs. Divine
Viewpoint</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All believers have trouble with their thought life to
some extent. A believer may be able to control overt activities and look fairly
good outwardly, but be completely shot through with a perverted thought life.
And it bothers them. They know they are redeemed. They rejoice in sins
forgiven, but their thought life is a paradox with their outward mode of
living. Many of the answers to the problems of thought life for the believer
are found in 2 Corinthians 10. This chapter could be entitled, “Human Viewpoint
vs. Divine Viewpoint.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul indicates in 2 Corinthians 10:1 that he is in
fellowship and that he has the mental attitude of meekness. This is the
attitude of grace. He also speaks of the gentleness of Christ. This is the
attitude of Paul’s mind, sweet reasonableness. Now beginning with the word “who,”
Paul begins quoting his critics who maligned him and were critical of him.
Actually they were calling him “two-faced” or in plain language, a hypocrite. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now I, Paul, myself urge you by the meekness and
gentleness of Christ—I who am meek when face to face with you, but bold toward
you when absent!&quot;  (2 Corinthians 10:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul is saying in 2 Corinthians 10:2, “I’m the same when
away as present, but I can get tough in either location if I have to.” You see,
Paul was criticized for being dogmatic. A believer has confidence when they
know doctrine and apply it to experience. They know where they are going and have
stability in life. Paul’s critics were very vicious and very caustic and said
his dogmatism was dirty. They said Paul was full of pride and double-minded, a
lion when at a distance, but a mouse when present.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I ask that when I am present I need not be bold with the
confidence with which I propose to be courageous against some, who regard us as
if we walked according to the flesh.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 10:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul continues on in 2 Corinthians 10:3 saying that we
are not to operate on the basis of carnal methods in the Christian walk even
though we are still living in the earth.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according
to the flesh,&quot;  (2 Corinthians 10:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>2 Corinthians 10:4 answers that the weapons of the Christian
are not human viewpoint, but mighty through divine viewpoint. The word
“fortresses” referred to ancient rock forts that were very difficult to
conquer. They were conquered by a war machine that battered down the walls, or
via a ramp that allowed the enemy to conquer them. In analogy, divine viewpoint
is much more powerful than human reasoning. In fact, what you think is more
important than what you do.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but
divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses.&quot;  (2 Corinthians
10:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the first four verses of this chapter, we have Bible
doctrine, and from verse five on we as believers are to apply this to
experience.  2 Corinthians 10:5 says we are to avoid human viewpoint thinking
that is contrary to the Word of God.  Intellectual systems that are not
God-based or oppose Bible doctrine or divine viewpoint should be avoided. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; We are destroying speculations and every lofty thing
raised up against the knowledge of God, and we are taking every thought captive
to the obedience of Christ,&quot;  (2 Corinthians 10:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Many believers use dreamworld to solve their problems,
but dreamworld never solves any problems. Worry is one of the fairy helpers in
dreamworld, but it never solves any problems. For example, there is a believer
who has had a rough day at the office. Instead of utilizing God's grace
resources and faith-rest, he sticks it out even though he has a bad mental
attitude. He is out of fellowship. So he comes home, kicks off his shoes and
tries to relax and read the paper. But really, he is not reading the paper, his
mind is reliving the day at work with the irritable boss, the nervous
secretaries, the griping customers, and the raw deal he has working there. Now
remember this guy is a believer. But yet, he tries to solve it by dreamworld.
He mentally tells off the boss. In his mental picture, he sees the boss begging
his forgiveness. He crucifies the secretarial help until they are pleading with
him for mercy. He tells off the griping customers. Keep in mind that all of
this is done mentally behind the paper he is reading. He dreams himself into a
plush office with nice salary. Suddenly, his wife calls him to supper. Boom, he
leaves dreamworld and comes back to reality and in the meantime he has solved
absolutely nothing.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Here is what that believer did. Any problem you try to
solve by human viewpoint is unchanged and still a problem. Why? Because the
believer is the problem! A problem cannot deal with a problem.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Here is what he should have done. A problem is solved by
divine viewpoint and becomes a problem under control. The believer is to use confession
of sin biblically followed by faith-rest whereby God's promises can be claimed
and applied to the situation. If he has mental attitude sins such as worry, he
confesses known sins to God the Father and then uses the promises, doctrines,
and principles of the Word. He looks at the problem from divine viewpoint and
believes that “the Battle is the Lord’s” and “if God be for me who can be
against me” and he places it into the Lord’s hands. He casts his cares upon the
Lord. Instead of a dreamworld hopper, he puts it into the divine hopper.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Thus he has mental stability and he thinks clearly. When
we pout, get moody, worry, fear or have doubts, we stop thinking clearly. Some
believers become cry-babies. They fall apart at the seams. They say, “Oh, if I
could just change jobs or geographical locations, my problems would go away.”
They withdraw, sublimate, get nervous, fret, become hysterical, and frankly,
they are miserable. They become bitter because no one cares and their self-pity
becomes apparent. Yes they are believers, but they are completely immersed in
the cares and issues of this world. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What is the answer to human viewpoint? Replacing it with
the Word, saturating the right lobe of the soul with Bible doctrine and
applying it to experience. Then armed with Bible truth, the believer is to
challenge the human viewpoint of life. This can only be done when “your
obedience is complete.” That is when you are in fellowship, casting your
burdens on the Lord and knowing that God has not given you the spirit of fear,
but of power and of love and of a sound mind! 2 Cor. 10:6; Psalms 55:22; 2 Tim.
1:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and we are ready to punish all disobedience, whenever
your obedience is complete.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 10:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Cast your burden upon the LORD and He will sustain you;
He will never allow the righteous to be shaken.&quot;  (Psalms 55:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of
power and love and discipline.&quot;  (2 Timothy 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul’s critics were looking at his outward appearance,
which was human viewpoint instead of considering what he was teaching. As
believers grow spiritually, they will have to learn to handle justified and
unjustified criticism with divine viewpoint. Every believer will have plenty of
it in this life. 2 Cor. 10:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;You are looking at things as they are outwardly. If
anyone is confident in himself that he is Christ's, let him consider this again
within himself, that just as he is Christ's, so also are we.&quot;  (2
Corinthians 10:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul mentions his critics again with reference to his
God-given authority and office of Apostle. Paul’s critics said he wrote
“lion-like letters of terror.” 2 Cor. 10:8-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For even if I boast somewhat further about our authority,
which the Lord gave for building you up and not for destroying you, I will not
be put to shame, for I do not wish to seem as if I would terrify you by my
letters.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 10:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul indicates in 2 Corinthians 10:10 that he was not
depending upon a beautiful appearance, but one thing was for sure that he was
the same absent or present. Enemies of the Gospel always try to belittle the
sincere Bible student. Paul, no doubt, had a speech impediment. He also had
some king of pain and hurt all of the time. The thorn in the flesh was a thing
of pain according to the Greek. Through it all, he was a man of God. That is
what counts. He was a man of God and open to any believer because he had Bible
doctrine in the right lobe of his soul! </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For they say, &quot;His letters are weighty and strong,
but his personal presence is unimpressive and his speech contemptible.&quot;
Let such a person consider this, that what we are in word by letters when
absent, such persons we are also in deed when present.&quot;  (2 Corinthians
10:10-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>2 Corinthians 10:12 is describing a mutual admiration
society where members pat each other on the back, obeying the proper ground
rules, and making the proper “clucking” noises to be “in” with the right crowd.
This is a description of a bunch of carnal Christians out of fellowship and not
applying divine viewpoint.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For we are not bold to class or compare ourselves with
some of those who commend themselves; but when they measure themselves by
themselves and compare themselves with themselves, they are without
understanding.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 10:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are to boast in the Lord. The phrase “but within the
measure of the sphere which God apportioned to us” is another way of stating
divine viewpoint. There are five results of thinking divine viewpoint in these
last verses. Mentally, divine viewpoint is the standard. 2 Cor. 10:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But we will not boast beyond our measure, but within the
measure of the sphere which God apportioned to us as a measure, to reach even
as far as you.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 10:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divine viewpoint results in outreach of the Gospel and
growth and development in the believer. 2 Cor. 10:14-15.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For we are not overextending ourselves, as if we did not
reach to you, for we were the first to come even as far as you in the gospel of
Christ; not boasting beyond our measure, that is, in other men's labors, but
with the hope that as your faith grows, we will be, within our sphere, enlarged
even more by you,&quot;  (2 Corinthians 10:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divine viewpoint results in increased missionary activity
and glorifying Him in our thinking. 2 Cor. 10:16-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;so as to preach the gospel even to the regions beyond
you, and not to boast in what has been accomplished in the sphere of another. But
HE WHO BOASTS IS TO BOAST IN THE LORD. For it is not he who commends himself
that is approved, but he whom the Lord commends.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 10:16-18,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divine viewpoint is actually occupation with the Person
and work of Christ. With all the emphasis in the world we live in on seeking
alternatives to God, some believers may be a bit gun-shy because they have used
some form of mental crutch before and it let them down. However, this is a
technique and a disciplined program of getting into the Word which will cause
unbelievable happiness, all based on Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every unbeliever needs to accept Jesus Christ as their
personal Savior. For those that accept the work of Jesus Christ on the Cross
for their sins, they needs to know how to handle the sin problem in their life.
This is the first technique. Then while in fellowship, they needs to claim
God’s promises by faith. The three ingredients of faith-rest are found in
Romans 4:16 - faith, grace and promise. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For this reason it is by faith, in order that it may be
in accordance with grace, so that the promise will be guaranteed to all the
descendants, not only to those who are of the Law, but also to those who are of
the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,&quot;  (Romans 4:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To get these promises, techniques, doctrines and
principles in the right lobe of the soul, the believer needs to live in the
Word. They needs to learn it, believe it, survey it, categorize it, and think
on it. Then the believer needs to understand how the character of Christ is
formed in them and how the fruit of the Spirit is produced in the believer’s
life. Gal. 5:22-23.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,
patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against
such things there is no law.&quot;  (Galatians 5:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A husband in fellowship loves his wife. Because his wife
is also in fellowship, she responds to her husband. Because they are in
fellowship, they have mental attitude joy, which is a divine given enthusiasm
to study the Word and apply it to life. Because a believer is in fellowship,
they have peace in their soul, they have patience, they are good and gentle,
and they are developing in their faith. They have mental attitude humility and
are in control of the situation, because God is in control of their soul. Not
only that, but they continue to grow spiritually and in divine viewpoint. Eph.
5:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation,
but be filled with the Spirit,&quot;  (Ephesians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Thus the believer is equipped for life and they are also
equipped for death. If the believer fails, they confess known sins and they
keep on moving. God has provided everything for taking care of the past and
everything for taking care of the future. This is the marvelous grace of God!</p>
