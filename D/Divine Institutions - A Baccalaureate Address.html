<h2><a name="_Divine_Viewpoint_Versus"></a>Divine Institutions - A
Baccalaureate Address</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Graduates and others honored to be here at this occasion.
I would like to begin my brief address with a question. Why does a clergyman
traditionally speak at a baccalaureate service or in an academic setting such
as this? Did you ever wonder? Why bother with religion? Well, I am not a
religious person, but I can answer the question.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our nation was founded on godly principles, not atheistic
principles as the present communistic state in the Soviet Union. Also, our
country was not founded on religious principles but Christian principles that
proceeded out of the Word of God, the Bible.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our country in its official documents recognizes the
sovereignty of God. Our country in its creeds recognizes the existence of God,
such as the well-known Flag Salute, “One nation under God, indivisible, with
liberty and justice for all.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our country in its official coinage has the inscription,
“In God we Trust” and this has appeared billions of times as an affirmation of
our faith in deity. Our country guarantees freedom of worship, that is worship
on a voluntary basis without coercion or slavery.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>And in this freedom, the Senior Class (without outside
influence) chooses on the basis of the good old democratic process who will
speak to them to the point, in the good old American tradition - stand up, talk
up, and then shut up.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>And so as a clergyman, I represent the country from the
standpoint of Christianity and the viewpoint of our spiritual heritage. Others
today will represent some section of the government of our country, some aspect
of the academics of our country, or even other phases. But, we look on the
fruits of academic provision We commemorate it today in the good old tradition.
Why? Freedom.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You who graduate today have had the freedom to invite the
speakers you want, the freedom of having an audience assemble and give
respectful attention to what is said, the freedom to graduate, the freedom to
pursue the area of your interest, to live life to the full as long as you do
not violate the privacy, property, and rights of your fellow man.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Where did all this freedom come from? The freedom to be
appointed to the great Naval Academy as is possible, or to discontinue school
as others may. Where did it come from? Can we take it for granted? Many nations
of the world do not have it.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We ultimately trace freedom back to Christianity, a
dynamic relationship with Christ through personal faith in Him. And then, the
Divine Institutions that keep us strong as individuals, as a nation, that
guarantees that our rights will be preserved. There are four Divine
Institutions:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first is Freedom. To us it means the freedom to
choose, the freedom to drive “X” brand of car across the USA, to buy “X” brand
of motorcycle. The freedom to go up the river, or go down to the beach. But,
ultimately, this Divine Institution guarantees the freedom to accept Jesus
Christ as our Savior or in fairness, to reject Him, to have nothing to do with
Christianity. But, be fair to this Divine Institution.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The second is Marriage. To explain this vast subject,
graduating class, I’ll have to claim your class motto, “The difficult we do
immediately, the impossible takes a little longer.” It is impossible for me to
elaborate here, except to say that God created one Adam, and one Eve. ...not
one Adam and a half dozen Eve’s or vice versa. God has ordained marriage but as
a minister for 20 years, I’ve seen more heartache in this area than any other
area of life. So bide your time, and when you men make the identification, make
sure it is the right one and about 50% of your troubles will be averted.
Otherwise you can know the slavery of wrong man/wrong woman.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The third Divine Institution is Family. God ordained
families for affection, love, protection, discipline, security and many other
things. Many of you were taught respect for authority, respect for property,
respect for the privacy of others, how to work, do an honest day’s work, to do
the unpleasant, to never give up. And, even though, at times things got a bit
gross. I am reminded of the 18 year old graduate that looked his Dad straight
in the eye just before going to college and said... “Thanks, Dad, for 18
wonderful years.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The last of the four Divine Institutions is Government.
Democracy may have its weak points, but democracy has made this the greatest
nation in the world. I am an American and you are an American. Our ancestors
have come from Protestant, Catholic, Jewish and other backgrounds. America is a
fantastic melting pot but she has been graced out by God with a government that
after nearly 200 years still has a great deal of freedom. The freedom to sing
“God Bless America.” The freedom to assembly in the church of our choice or to
sleep all day Sunday. The freedom to go see Grandma on a Sunday afternoon. The
freedom to drive from Brookings to New York City without any checkpoint<span
lang=EL>σ</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>So, you have it. That is why a clergyman still has the
honor and privilege of ministering to a group of honored graduates. To remind
us of the spiritual heritage of our nation, to pause to remember why we are
truly a great nation and free, to realize what we have and hold as Americans
...these are the reasons.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>I cannot help but quote the end of that great speech
delivered before the Virginia convention so long ago by the brilliant Patrick
Henry; “Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of
chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may
take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!” Freedom and liberty in
Christ are worth preserving!</p>
