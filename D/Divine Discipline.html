<h2><a name="_D-Divine_Discipline"></a><a name="_Divine_Discipline"></a>Divine
Discipline </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divine discipline is from the justice of God in grace to
correct, punish, encourage, train, and motivate the believer to return to
fellowship with God. Divine discipline is for believers only. Heb. 12:5-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and you have forgotten the exhortation which is addressed to
you as sons, “MY SON, DO NOT REGARD LIGHTLY THE DISCIPLINE OF THE LORD, NOR
FAINT WHEN YOU ARE REPROVED BY HIM; FOR THOSE WHOM THE LORD LOVES HE
DISCIPLINES, AND HE SCOURGES EVERY SON WHOM HE RECEIVES.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews
12:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Discipline is based on love. When a believer is out of
fellowship, divine discipline is designed to get them to confess their sins to
the Father and be restored to fellowship. Discipline never implies loss of
salvation. Gal. 3:26.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Galatians
3:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divine discipline is chastisement for sins of the
believer in the immediate vicinity of sin. Discipline is removed by confession
of sin by naming or acknowledging our known sins to God the Father per 1 John
1:9. 1 Cor. 11:31-32.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
John 1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But if we judged ourselves rightly, we would not be judged.
But when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord so that we will not be
condemned along with the world.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 11:31-32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When suffering continues after confession of sin the
purpose is for blessing. Job 5:17-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Behold, how happy is the man whom God reproves, So do not
despise the discipline of the Almighty. “For He inflicts pain, and gives
relief; He wounds, and His hands also heal.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Job 5:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All divine discipline is confined to time. There is no
discipline in eternity. Rev. 21:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there
will no longer be any death; there will no longer be any mourning, or crying,
or pain; the first things have passed away.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation 21:4,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If you suspect suffering in your life and have confessed
your known sins to God the Father, look for something near at hand. Discipline
always relates sins in the immediate past with the exception of the sin unto
death. Heb. 12:15; 1 John 5:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“See to it that no one comes short of the grace of God; that no
root of bitterness springing up causes trouble, and by it many be defiled;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews
12:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“If anyone sees his brother committing a sin not leading to
death, he shall ask and God will for him give life to those who commit sin not
leading to death. There is a sin leading to death; I do not say that he should
make request for this.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 John 5:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The other side of eternal security is discipline for
believers out of fellowship. Certain sins bring triple compound discipline.
Matt. 7:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Do not judge so that you will not be judged. “For in the way
you judge, you will be judged; and by your standard of measure, it will be
measured to you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 7:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Mental Distress From Continued Divine Discipline</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A prime factor in causing mental distress in believers is
when the believer under discipline fights it, refusing to properly use 1 John
1:9. Certain thinking patterns if harbored continually can cause mental
distress. They include guilt complexes, harboring bitterness toward others, hatred
toward others, jealousy or envy, fear about the present, future, and death, anxiety
or worry about little things, desire in the mind for revenge, and judging
another believer or running them down to others. Heb. 12:3; Heb. 12:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
John 1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For consider Him who has endured such hostility by sinners
against Himself, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews
12:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“See to it that no one comes short of the grace of God; that no
root of bitterness springing up causes trouble, and by it many be defiled;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews
12:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divine discipline results in restrained sinning. It also
teaches the believer the spiritual lessons which result in spiritual growth.
Heb. 12:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“All discipline for the moment seems not to be joyful, but
sorrowful; yet to those who have been trained by it, afterwards it yields the
peaceful fruit of righteousness.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 12:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Chain Sinning</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Chain sinning is where one sin leads to the next sin
without confession of sin. Mental attitude sins motivate chain sinning. Chain
sinning can also be caused by bitterness, hatred, guilt complex, by constantly
associating all suffering with some sin in the past, public confession of sin,
trying to hurt, discipline, or condemn someone else, blaming others for your sins
and failures, and discussing sins and past failures with others in order to
gain their sympathy.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Avoiding Divine Discipline</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Confession of sin results in the filling of the Holy
Spirit. The result of confession of sin biblically is the return to fellowship
with God whereby you can continue to produce divine good or the fruit of the
Spirit. Heb. 12:1; James 1:2-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses
surrounding us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so
easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before
us,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 12:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various
trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance. And let
endurance have its perfect result, so that you may be perfect and complete,
lacking in nothing.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(James 1:2-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>The return to fellowship with God
allows occupation with Christ. Heb. 12:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith,
who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has
sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 12:2,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>The return to fellowship with God
enables the believer to avoid mental attitude sins. In Hebrews 12:3, “grow weary”
means the continued mental attitude sins can even result is some types of
psychological maladies. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For consider Him who has endured such hostility by sinners
against Himself, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews
12:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>The return to fellowship with God
enables the believer to have victory over the old sin nature. Hebrews 12:4 encourages
the believer to confess sins biblically to God the Father, keep moving, isolate
the sin, stand on the principle of grace, use faith-rest to claim God's
promises and apply the resulting rationales to life’s situations and
difficulties, and to thereby grow in the spiritual life. </p>

<p class=Verses>“You have not yet resisted to the point of shedding blood in
your striving against sin;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 12:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>The return to fellowship with God
enables the believer to live in the Word and to learn from the divine
discipline to grow spiritually. Heb. 12:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and you have forgotten the exhortation which is addressed to
you as sons, “MY SON, DO NOT REGARD LIGHTLY THE DISCIPLINE OF THE LORD, NOR
FAINT WHEN YOU ARE REPROVED BY HIM;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 12:5, NASB)</p>
