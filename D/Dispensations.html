<h2><a name="_D-Dispensations"></a><a name="_Dispensations"></a>Dispensations </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Dispensations are periods of human history expressed in
terms of divine revelation or divine viewpoint. God’s will and plan are not the
same for every dispensation. Believers must orient to God's will and plan in
each dispensation. God tests the believer’s orientation to His plan in each
dispensation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Although there are many interpretations of human history,
the only accurate theological interpretation is dispensational. The word
“dispensation” is now used as a technical theological term for an era of human
history from the divine viewpoint.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The History of Civilizations </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The divine interpretation of history is set forth in the
Word of God. The Bible gives the mind of Christ with regard to the ups and
downs of civilizations. According to the Bible, when there is a saturation of
Bible doctrine in any one generation or period of history, there is prosperity
and blessing from God. An example was the period from 516 BC to 400 BC and the
period from 400 BC to 323 BC. Also, the time of the Antonine Caesars from 96 AD
to 180 AD. Great Britain became great because of her adherence to Bible
doctrine. When Bible doctrine was forsaken, down went the nation. The Unites
States of America is heading in the same direction.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God in history operates through different administrations
or dispensations. Eph. 3:1-10.</p>

<p class=Verses><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span>“that by revelation
there was made known to me the mystery, as I wrote before in brief. By
referring to this, when you read you can understand my insight into the mystery
of Christ, which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as
it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit;”
(Ephesians 3:3-5, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span>“To me, the very
least of all saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the
unfathomable riches of Christ, and to bring to light what is the administration
of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God who created all things; so
that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known through the church to
the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly places.” (Ephesians 3:8-10,
NASB)</p>

src="Dispensations1.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'><i>The Age of
the Gentiles</i>. Gen. 1-11. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'><i>The Age of
the Jews or Israel</i>.  Gen. 12, the Gospels, and Rev. 6-19.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'><i>The Church
Age</i>. Epistles plus Acts.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'><i>The Kingdom
or the Millennium</i>. Rev. 20, Isaiah 65, many passages in the minor prophets.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>History proves one thing, that mankind learns nothing
from history. Nations forget that adherence to Bible doctrine is the answer to
stability. Nations forget that a strong military is the answer to stability
from animal-like aggression from other nations. Much history can be gleaned
from an intensive study of the battles and battlefields of by-gone decades and
centuries. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/WXYZ/War.html">War</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Salvation By Faith In Jesus Christ In Every
Dispensation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Although there is a different plan from God for each
dispensation, salvation is the same in every dispensation – personal belief in
the substitutionary spiritual death of Jesus Christ on the Cross for the sins
of all mankind. In all of human history, there is only one Savior, Jesus
Christ, and He is revealed in different ways in each dispensation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Old Testament dispensations, they looked forward to
the Cross, where the Messiah would pay for their sins on the Cross. This
payment for sin was taught in Israel through their Levitical offerings. These
were rituals that illustrated what the Messiah would do on the Cross for
mankind. Israel’s Feast of the Passover and the Day of Atonement taught or
foreshadowed the saving work of Jesus Christ. Articles of furniture in the
Tabernacle taught salvation by grace in the Savior to come – Jesus Christ. Isaiah
53.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“He was despised and forsaken of men, A man of sorrows and
acquainted with grief; And like one from whom men hide their face He was
despised, and we did not esteem Him.” (Isaiah 53:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But He was pierced through for our transgressions, He was
crushed for our iniquities; The chastening for our well-being fell upon Him,
And by His scourging we are healed. All of us like sheep have gone astray, Each
of us has turned to his own way; But the LORD has caused the iniquity of us all
To fall on Him.” (Isaiah 53:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 15:6, Abraham believed in the Messiah and
received God's very own righteousness just as a believers of all dispensations
receive. Rom. 4:2-3; <span style='color:black'>Rom 1:16. </span></p>

<p class=Verses>“Then he believed in the LORD; and He reckoned it to him as
righteousness.” (Genesis 15:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to
boast about, but not before God. For what does the Scripture say? &quot;ABRAHAM
BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS CREDITED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS.&quot;” (Romans
4:2-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God
for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the
Greek.” (Romans 1:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Church Age, we look back at the work of Jesus
Christ on the Cross in 30 AD. In future dispensations, they also will look back
at the Cross and express faith alone in Jesus Christ alone for salvation. God’s
Gospel of salvation has always existed in human history from Adam and Eve and
will continue to exist to the end of the Millennium.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Greek Words Used For Dispensations</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Greek word for “times” in 1 Thessalonians 5:1 and “long
ages past” in Romans 16:25 is <span lang=EL>χρο</span>́<span lang=EL>νος</span>
(chronos) and means chronological or time in its sequence of events. For
example, the Dispensation of Israel has a sequence of three main events; the
period of the Patriarchs, the Mosaic Law and the Fifth Cycle of Discipline. Peter
also used the same Greek word for “times” in referring to dispensations in 1
Peter 1:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now as to the times and the epochs, brethren, you have no need
of anything to be written to you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Thessalonians 5:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now to Him who is able to establish you according to my gospel
and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery
which has been kept secret for long ages past,” (Romans 16:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For He was foreknown before the foundation of the world, but
has appeared in these last times for the sake of you” (1 Peter 1:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Greek word for “epochs” in Acts 1:7 is <span lang=EL>καιρο</span>́<span
lang=EL>ς</span><span lang=EL> </span>(kairos) and means to take a period of
time and divide it up into chronological ages. In Luke 21:24, <i>kairos</i> is
used for the “times of the Gentiles.” </p>

<p class=Verses>“He said to them, &quot;It is not for you to know times or
epochs which the Father has fixed by His own authority;” (Acts 1:7, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“and they will fall by the edge of the sword, and will be led
captive into all the nations; and Jerusalem will be trampled under foot by the
Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.” (Luke 21:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Kairos</i> is used in 1 Thessalonians 5:1 for the
organization of historical events into dispensational categories. It refers to
orientation to the Church Age as “time” in Romans 13:11, Romans 8:18, and
Romans 11:5.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“Do this, knowing the time, that it is already the hour for you
to awaken from sleep; for now salvation is nearer to us than when we believed.”
(Romans 13:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are
not worthy to be compared with the glory that is to be revealed to us.” (Romans
8:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“In the same way then, there has also come to be at the present
time a remnant according to God's gracious choice.” (Romans 11:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Kairos</i> is also used for orientation to the Jewish
Age in Ephesians 2:11-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore remember that formerly you, the Gentiles in the
flesh, who are called &quot;Uncircumcision&quot; by the so-called
&quot;Circumcision,&quot; which is performed in the flesh by human hands—
remember that you were at that time separate from Christ, excluded from the
commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no
hope and without God in the world.” (Ephesians 2:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul taught dispensations in Ephesians 3:2 where “if” is
a first class condition and means if and it’s true. Paul was teaching about
dispensations. “Stewardship” in the Greek is <span lang=EL>οι</span>̓<span
lang=EL>κονομι</span>́<span lang=EL>α</span> (oikonomia) and means stewardship,
administration and is often translated dispensations. </p>

<p class=Verses>“if indeed you have heard of the stewardship of God’s grace
which was given to me for you;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 3:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ephesians 1:21, “age” is <span lang=EL>αι</span>̓<span
lang=EL>ω</span>́<span lang=EL>ν</span> (aiōn) and also means dispensation. It
is an era where God works through a specific organization. <i>Aiōn</i> is also
used for divine categories in human history in Romans 16:25, Ephesians 3:9, and
Colossians 1:26.</p>

<p class=Verses>“far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and
every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians
1:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now to Him who is able to establish you according to my gospel
and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery
which has been kept secret for long ages past,” (Romans 16:25, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“and to bring to light what is the administration of the
mystery which for ages has been hidden in God who created all things;”
(Ephesians 3:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“that is, the mystery which has been hidden from the past ages
and generations, but has now been manifested to His saints,” (Colossians 1:26,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God’s Dispensational Administration</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God administers the human race via dispensations. The
human race is His estate. God administers that estate in a certain way. God’s
administration means delegation of authority in each dispensation. God appoints
the administrator for each dispensation from among the believers. Rom. 3:2;
Acts 15:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Great in every respect. First of all, that they were entrusted
with the oracles of God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 3:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““Simeon has related how God first concerned Himself about
taking from among the Gentiles a people for His name.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 15:14,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Administrators may fail or succeed. Whether they do or
not, God’s plan moves on as He decreed it would in Eternity Past. In Esther
2:8, “So it came about” indicates God’s plan is always carried out. Esther
2:16-17; Esther 8:7-8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So it came about when the command and decree of the king were
heard and many young ladies were gathered to the citadel of Susa into the
custody of Hegai, that Esther was taken to the king’s palace into the custody
of Hegai, who was in charge of the women.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Esther 2:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus to his royal palace in
the tenth month which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.
The king loved Esther more than all the women, and she found favor and kindness
with him more than all the virgins, so that he set the royal crown on her head
and made her queen instead of Vashti.” (Esther 2:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the
Jew, &quot;Behold, I have given the house of Haman to Esther, and him they have
hanged on the gallows because he had stretched out his hands against the Jews.
&quot;Now you write to the Jews as you see fit, in the king's name, and seal it
with the king's signet ring; for a decree which is written in the name of the
king and sealed with the king's signet ring may not be revoked.&quot;” (Esther
8:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is only one administrator for each dispensation. 1
Sam. 12:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>““For the LORD will not abandon His people on account of His
great name, because the LORD has been pleased to make you a people for Himself.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Samuel 12:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'><u>Dispensations Administrators</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'><i>Age of the

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'><i>Age of the

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every dispensation involves revelation which was not
given in previous dispensations, as well as a recognition of that which was
accumulative. Promises found in any dispensation that are grace promises are
always applicable to any believer in any dispensation. Isaiah 41:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“‘Do not fear, for I am with you; Do not anxiously look about
you, for I am your God. I will strengthen you, surely I will help you, Surely I
will uphold you with My righteous right hand.’“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah 41:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The ultimate in dispensations is the application of Bible
doctrine to experience so that at all times your life you are personally
oriented to life. If you understand the chronology of times, you don’t confuse “the
Law” with “grace.” You aren’t trying to make the “Church Age’’ world a “Millennial”
world and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><a name="_The_Age_of"></a><b>The Age of the Gentiles</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The dispensation of the Age of the Gentiles began with
the creation of mankind and continued to the Exodus of Israel from Egypt in
1441 BC. In Genesis 2, there was the Era of Positive Volition also referred to
as the Age of Innocence. This era was from the creation of man until the fall
in the Garden of Eden.  The divine institutions of Volition and Marriage began,
but failed even under perfect environment.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 3, there is the Era of Negative Volition also
referred to as the Age of Conscience. The Era of Negative Volition was from the
fall of man to Abraham. In this era, two more divine institutions began - Family
and Nationalism. This was the time of great disasters on the earth such as the
cohabiting of fallen angels with human women of Genesis 6 resulting in the
Nephilim, the Great Flood of Noah’s time, and the Tower of Babel.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 11, there is the era of Nationalism also
referred to as the Age of Human Government and the Era of the Patriarchs and
was from Abraham to Moses. In this era, the Jewish race began with Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob. The Gentiles continued through the three sons of Noah - Shem,
Ham, and Japheth.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This age was characterized by only one language and one
race. They still did not get along. In this age, the four Divine Institutions
were developed and attacked by Satan. He attacked Volition in Genesis 3. He
attacked Marriage and the Family in Gen. 6 involving angelic infiltration of
the human race. He attacked Nationalism in Genesis 11:1-9.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The scope of the Age of the Gentiles was from Adam to the
Tower of Babel. During this age, there was no Canon of Scripture.  There was
divine revelation, but not in written form. Salvation was by faith alone in the
Messiah to come, Jesus Christ as it is today. There was no basic missionary
agency. There was evangelism, but no missionary agency. The family was the
basis of evangelism. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/G/Age%20of%20the%20Gentiles.html">The Age of the
Gentiles.</a></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><a name="_The_Age_of_1"></a><b>The Age of the Jews</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Age of the Jews is also called the Dispensation of
Israel or the Age of Israel. The Age of the Jews started when Moses led Israel
out of Egypt in the Exodus and ends at the Second Advent of Jesus Christ.
However, the Church Age has been inserted at the Day of Pentecost and will end
at the Rapture of the Church. This age or dispensation also includes the First
Advent of Jesus Christ or His incarnation from 4 BC to 30 AD. Following the
Rapture, the Age of the Jews will resume to complete the last seven years called
the Tribulation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This age is outlined in Genesis 12, in Malachi minus
Millennial passages such as Isaiah 11, 35, 64, and 65. Also, Matthew, Mark,
Luke, John except John 13-17 and Revelation 6-19.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This age is also called the Age of the Patriarchs
(Abraham to the giving of the Law). This age is also called the Age of the Law
(Moses to Christ). This age also includes the Tribulation (the Rapture of the
Church until the Second Advent).</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This age is characterized by many races and many
languages with nations separated. There was a specific missionary agency - the
regenerate of Israel. Israel was to give the Gospel to people speaking
different languages. Abraham was the founder of this missionary base. Abraham
was a Gentile who became a Jew through regeneration. This missionary base must
be characterized by security. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/C/Covenants%20to%20Israel.html">Covenants
to Israel</a>. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Since there was a missionary base, there must be divine discipline
for failure in the form of the Five Cycles of Discipline in Leviticus 26:27-46.
The scope of the Age of the Jews was from Abraham to the Second Advent, minus
the Church Age. Salvation was through faith in Christ Jesus, not salvation by
keeping the Law. Spirituality included faith-rest, confession of sin, and
occupation with Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Characteristics of the Age of Israel</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Salvation by faith in Jesus Christ. Rom. 1:1-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle,
set apart for the gospel of God, which He promised beforehand through His
prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, who was born of a
descendant of David according to the flesh, who was declared the Son of God
with power by the resurrection from the dead, according to the Spirit of
holiness, Jesus Christ our Lord,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 1:1-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>No union with Christ in death, burial, and resurrection.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jews and proselytes.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Church Age</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Church Age began on the Day of Pentecost and will end
at the Rapture of the Church. It is composed of two periods of time – the
Pre-Canon Period and the Post-Canon Period. The Pre-Canon Period of the Church
Age was from 30 AD to 96 AD. It was the time of temporary spiritual gifts and
the time when the New Testament was being written. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Post-Canon Period of the Church Age is from 96 AD to
the Rapture of the Church. It is the era of permanent spiritual gifts and the
time when the completed written Canon of New Testament Scripture is available
and is being disseminated throughout the world. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The dispensation of the Church Age was inserted into the
Age of the Jews to form the Body of Christ that is made up of all Church Age
believers. The Body of Christ is being formed through the Baptism of the Spirit
whereby all believers are placed into union with Jesus Christ at salvation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Church Age brought a new modus operandi. The Church
Age is a very special age, a unique age, the age of mystery doctrine, an age of
great grace provision and assets not existing in Old Testament times. It provides
a supernatural grace means of the spiritual life. All of that has been provided
under the power and filling of the Holy Spirit enabling you to identify and
utilize your spiritual gift to the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual gifts came into operation in the Church Age. In
the Age of the Gentiles and the Age of the Jews, there were no spiritual gifts.
There were talents and abilities such as David being a king, a singer and
musician, a great military man and great leader. He used all of that for the
glory of God, but the only spiritual gift given and mentioned in Old Testament
times is the gift of prophecy. Some men had both the gift and the office, but
in the Church Age, you have every Christian receiving a spiritual gift. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Church Age is outlined in John 13 – John 17, Acts,
the New Testament epistles (except for certain portions that deal with the
Tribulation) and Revelation 1 through Revelation 3. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Characteristics of the Church Age</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Church Age is characterized by the believer’s unique
grace assets which include the following: </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Salvation by faith alone in Christ Jesus alone. Acts
16:31.</p>

<p class=Verses>“They said, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved,
you and your household.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 16:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Positional Truth where all believers are placed into
union with Christ at salvation. Christianity is not a religion, but a personal
relationship with Jesus Christ. 1 Cor. 12:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether
Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one
Spirit.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 12:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>In the Church, all distinctions
have been removed regarding race, sex or social status. There is neither Jew
nor Gentile. Gal. 3:28.</p>

<p class=Verses>“There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor
free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ
Jesus.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Galatians 3:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The indwelling of the deity of the Lord Jesus Christ in
the body of every Church Age believer as the residence of the Shekinah Glory. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The indwelling of the Holy Spirit in the body of every
Church Age believer to prepare a suitable residence for the Shekinah Glory.
Only a few Old Testament saints were endued with the Holy Spirit, but only for
special purposes. John 14:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“that is the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive,
because it does not see Him or know Him, but you know Him because He abides
with you and will be in you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 14:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The universal priesthood of the believer. Never has God
given so much power and meaning to a believer. Every believer is an ambassador
for Jesus Christ and therefore in full time Christian service. 1 Peter 2:5; 1
Peter 2:9; 2 Cor. 5:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“you also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual
house for a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
through Jesus Christ.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Peter 2:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But you are A CHOSEN RACE, A royal PRIESTHOOD, A HOLY NATION,
A PEOPLE FOR God’s OWN POSSESSION, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of
Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Peter 2:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were
making an appeal through us; we beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to
God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Corinthians 5:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>The written Canon of Scripture was
completed after 96 AD.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The filling of the Holy Spirit results in spirituality -
a supernatural way of life. A supernatural way of life from the enabling power
of the Holy Spirit when the believer is in fellowship whereby the Holy Spirit
controls the soul. There is nothing we can do in the flesh which pleases God.
The filling of the Holy Spirit is the only means of executing this supernatural
way of life coupled with confession of sin via 1 John 1:9. Eph. 5:18; Gal.
5:22-23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but
be filled with the Spirit,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience,
kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things
there is no law.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Galatians 5:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>Emphasis on role and
responsibility of the individual believer. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>The only mandated ritual or ordinance
is the Eucharist or Communion. 1 Cor. 11:23-26.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to
you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which He was betrayed took bread; and
when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, “This is My body, which is for
you; do this in remembrance of Me.” In the same way He took the cup also after
supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in My blood; do this, as often as
you drink it, in remembrance of Me.” For as often as you eat this bread and
drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until He comes.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Corinthians 11:23-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>There is another ritual, water
baptism, but this one is not mandated. It is an optional ritual that is a
public demonstration of the believer having already accepted Jesus Christ as
their Savior. Acts 8:36-38.</p>

<p class=Verses>“As they went along the road they came to some water; and the
eunuch said, “Look! Water! What prevents me from being baptized?” [And Philip
said, “If you believe with all your heart, you may.” And he answered and said, “I
believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.”] And he ordered the chariot to
stop; and they both went down into the water, Philip as well as the eunuch, and
he baptized him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 8:36-38, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>No sabbath. We worship every day.
Col 2:16-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore no one is to act as your judge in regard to food or
drink or in respect to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath day— things which
are a mere shadow of what is to come; but the substance belongs to Christ. Let
no one keep defrauding you of your prize by delighting in self-abasement and
the worship of the angels, taking his stand on visions he has seen, inflated
without cause by his fleshly mind,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Colossians 2:16-18, NASB)</p>

Age</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><a name="_The_Tribulation_1"></a><b>The Tribulation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Tribulation will begin at the Rapture of the Church
and will end at the Second Advent of Jesus Christ. This dispensation will be
seven literal years in duration where the Age of the Jews will resume and be
completed. This dispensation is also referred to as Daniel’s 70<sup>th</sup>
Week. The last half of the Tribulation dispensation is also called the time of
Satan’s desperation and the Great Tribulation. The death and destruction on
earth will be unlike anything that the world has ever experienced. The
destruction will be so great that if the time were extended, there would be no
believers left alive. Matt. 24:21-22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For then there will be a great tribulation, such as has
not occurred since the beginning of the world until now, nor ever will.
&quot;Unless those days had been cut short, no life would have been saved; but
for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short.” (Matthew 24:21-22,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Tribulation will be the greatest power struggle in
all of human history. It will be Satan’s last attempt to destroy all Jewish
believers prior to the return of Jesus Christ at His Second Advent. At the
middle of the Tribulation, Satan and all fallen angels will be cast down to the
earth. In this time of the Satan’s desperation, Satan will do all that he can
to destroy the Jewish population of the earth – especially the remnant of
Jewish believers.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As with all dispensations in human history, God will
evangelize the unbeliever with salvation obtained the same way as in all
dispensations – faith alone in the work of Jesus Christ alone on the Cross. Matt.
24:14; Rev. 14:12. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the
whole world as a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.”
(Matthew 24:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Here is the perseverance of the saints who keep the
commandments of God and their faith in Jesus.” (Revelation 14:12, NASB)</p>

Tribulation</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Age of the Millennium</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Millennium or the Millennial reign of Christ runs
from the Second Advent of Christ to the end of human history and will last for
1,000 literal years. For these 1,000 years, the earth will have perfect
environment. The human race (unbelievers) that survived the Tribulation and the
Armageddon campaign will be judged by our Lord Jesus Christ at His Second
Advent. Here, Jesus Christ will separate all believers from unbelievers and
remove the unbelievers from the earth. This is called the Baptism of the Fire
and means that only believers (Jews and Gentiles) still alive on earth will
enter the Millennium in their physical bodies. All other believers will be in
resurrection bodies. The nation of Israel will be restored to the Land and
God's unconditional covenants to Israel will be fulfilled. The remnant of
Israel (believers) will begin the Millennium in the Land.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Age of the Millennium is outlined in Revelation 20,
Isaiah 11, Isaiah 35, Isaiah 64, Isaiah 65 and many other passages. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Since the believers that enter the Millennium will
procreate, there will be a growing number of unbelievers that result. Even in
perfect environment, some will still chose freely to reject the Gospel of Jesus
Christ. Rev. 20:7-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“When the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released
from his prison, and will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four
corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for the war; the
number of them is like the sand of the seashore. And they came up on the broad
plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city,
and fire came down from heaven and devoured them.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation
20:7-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Life will be extended on earth. Capital punishment will
be seldom used. Salvation, as for all dispensations, will be by faith alone in
the work of the Lord Jesus Christ on the Cross. Old Testament sacrifices will
be resumed. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the end of the Millennium, Satan will be released and
will institute his final revolt called the Gog and Magog Revolt. Jesus Christ
will end this revolt just as suddenly and completely as He did the Armageddon
Campaign 1,000 years earlier. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The universe will be destroyed followed by the Great
White Throne Judgment or the Last Judgment. Following this last judgment by
Jesus Christ Himself, Satan, all fallen angels, and all unbelievers will be
cast into the Lake of Fire for eternity. Rev. 20:11-15. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat upon it, from
whose presence earth and heaven fled away, and no place was found for them. And
I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books
were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life; and the
dead were judged from the things which were written in the books, according to
their deeds. And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and Hades
gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged, every one of them
according to their deeds. Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of
fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire. And if anyone’s name was not
found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation
20:11-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Comparison of The Church Age and The Age of the Jews</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are many differences between the Church Age and the
Age of the Jews or the Age of Israel.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-align:justify'><img border=0 width=500
height=600 id="Picture 1" src="Dispensations2.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Age of the Jews, Israel’s relationship with God is
always related to their unconditional covenants. In the Church Age, all
believers are placed into union with Jesus Christ through the Baptism of the
Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Age of the Jews, there is a specialized Levitical priesthood.
In the Church Age, all believers are priests and therefore represent themselves
before God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Age of the Jews, they looked to the future
atonement for sins by the Messiah on the Cross and believed. In the Church Age,
we look to the past completed unlimited atonement for sins by Jesus Christ on
the Cross and believe. Salvation in all dispensations is always the same - by faith
alone in Jesus Christ alone.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Age of the Jews, to commemorate the salvation work
of the Messiah to come, believers brought select animals to the priests in the
temple for a ritual sin offering. In the Church Age, the ritual of Communion or
the Eucharist is where the believer looks back in time to the completed
substitutionary spiritual death of Jesus Christ on the Cross - the Blood of
Christ. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Age of the Jews, spirituality is regained by confess
their known sins directly to God and then claiming the promises of God through
faith rest. In the Church Age, believers confess their known sins directly to
God the Father through silent prayer and God is always faithful and just to
forgive those named sins and to forgive all unknown or forgotten sins. Spirituality
was then gained via the filling of the Holy Spirit.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Age of the Jews, believers were elected to a new racial
species. In the Church Age, all believers are elected to a new spiritual
species.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Age of the Jews, they had an Old Testament Canon
of Scripture. In the Church Age after 96 AD, we have the completed written Canon
of Scripture - Old Testament and New Testament. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Age of the Jews, Jesus Christ, as the Shekinah
Glory, indwelt the Holy of Holies in the Temple. In the Church Age, the deity
of Jesus Christ indwells the body of every believer as the Shekinah Glory. The
bodies of believers in the Church Age are temples of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Age of the Jews, there was enduement of the Holy
Spirit only for a select few and for special purposes. In the Church Age, all
believers are permanently indwelled by the Holy Spirit in their bodies to
prepare a residence for the Shekinah Glory. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Age of the Jews there was only the spiritual gift
of prophecy given to select few. In the Church Age, every believer is given a
spiritual gift by the Holy Spirit at salvation. The believer’s spiritual gift
becomes operational as they mature spiritually. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Comparison of the Rapture and the Second Advent </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Rapture of the Church</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Only believers will see Jesus Christ. It will be private.
Heb. 9:28; Acts 1:11. </p>

<p class=Verses>“so Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of
many, will appear a second time for salvation without reference to sin, to
those who eagerly await Him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 9:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“They also said, “Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into
the sky? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in
just the same way as you have watched Him go into heaven.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts
1:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Christ meets believers in the air and all go to heaven. Bible
does not state when this will be. 1 Thess. 4:17; John 14:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together
with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we shall always be
with the Lord.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Thessalonians 4:17, NASB)  </p>

<p class=Verses>““If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and
receive you to Myself, that where I am, there you may be also.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John
14:3, NASB)  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers’ divine good production will be rewarded at the
Judgment Seat of Christ. 1 Cor. 3:11-15; Rev. 22:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For no man can lay a foundation other than the one which is
laid, which is Jesus Christ. Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold,
silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, each man’s work will become evident;
for the day will show it because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire
itself will test the quality of each man’s work. If any man’s work which he has
built on it remains, he will receive a reward. If any man’s work is burned up,
he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Corinthians 3:11-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““Behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to
render to every man according to what he has done.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation
22:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The imminency of the Rapture of the Church is a source of
comfort to believers. 1 Thess. 4:16-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout,
with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in
Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up
together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we shall
always be with the Lord. Therefore comfort one another with these words.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Thessalonians 4:16-18, NASB)  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There will be no recorded changes in nature. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The world (people) will not be judged at this time.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Rapture is a mystery and was hidden and not mentioned
in the Old Testament. 1 Cor. 15:51.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Behold, I tell you a mystery; we will not all sleep, but we
will all be changed,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 15:51, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Unconditional covenants to Israel remain unfulfilled. God
does not deal with Satan at the Rapture.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Second Advent of Jesus Christ </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every eye shall see Him. Public. Rev. 1:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“BEHOLD, HE IS COMING WITH THE CLOUDS, and every eye will see
Him, even those who pierced Him; and all the tribes of the earth will mourn
over Him. So it is to be. Amen.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Christ will first stand on the Mount of Olives. Zech.
14:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“In that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which
is in front of Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split in
its middle from east to west by a very large valley, so that half of the
mountain will move toward the north and the other half toward the south.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Zechariah
14:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Unbelievers remaining alive following the Armageddon
Campaign will be removed from the earth. Matt. 24:37-39.</p>

<p class=Verses>““For the coming of the Son of Man will be just like the days
of Noah. “For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking,
marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, and
they did not understand until the flood came and took them all away; so will
the coming of the Son of Man be.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 24:37-39, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Church Age believers with resurrection bodies return with
Christ as His bride. 1 Thess. 3:13; Col. 3:4; 2 Thess. 1:10; Zech. 14:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“so that He may establish your hearts without blame in holiness
before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all His saints.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Thessalonians 3:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“When Christ, who is our life, is revealed, then you also will
be revealed with Him in glory.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Colossians 3:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“when He comes to be glorified in His saints on that day, and
to be marveled at among all who have believed—for our testimony to you was
believed.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Thessalonians 1:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“You will flee by the valley of My mountains, for the valley of
the mountains will reach to Azel; yes, you will flee just as you fled before
the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the LORD, my God, will
come, and all the holy ones with Him!”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Zechariah 14:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ returns physically to the earth seven years after
the Rapture. Matt. 24:29-30.</p>

<p class=Verses>““But immediately after the tribulation of those days THE SUN
WILL BE DARKENED, AND THE MOON WILL NOT GIVE ITS LIGHT, AND THE STARS WILL FALL
from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. “And then the sign
