<h2>Spiritual Death </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Adam was created spiritually alive and had fellowship
with God. When Adam decided to willfully sin against God's single mandate in
the Garden and eat of the fruit, he died spiritually and was in a state of sin.
Since perfect God cannot have contact with sin, so he lost his fellowship with
God. He then had only relative righteousness (-R) for the first time. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>After the Fall, Adam also acquired or brought into
existence an old sin nature. Because Adam willfully sinned, part of God's
punishment was that he would pass this now genetically-formed old sin nature on
to his children. Thus, all human beings (except for the Lord Jesus Christ) are
born with this old sin nature in their DNA. The other part of Adam’s divine
discipline is that Adam’s Original Sin would also be imputed to all human
beings at birth. This imputation at birth is done by God the Father just after
He imputes soul life to the emerging baby at physical birth. This is imputed
sin.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Members of the human race (of Adam’s seed) are born
sinners and spiritually dead because of the genetically-inherited old sin
nature (inherent sin) and the imputation of Adam’s Original Sin (imputed sin)
at birth. Adam’s willful sin in the Garden is the basis for all of mankind
being born with an old sin nature (inherent sin) and Adam’s Original Sin
(imputed sin) being imputed to all by God the Father at birth. 1 Cor. 15:22;
Rom. 5:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made
alive.” (1 Corinthians 15:22, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world,
and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned—”
(Romans 5:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A doctrinal clarification of Romans 5:12 is, “Therefore,
just as through one man (Adam) sin (first old sin nature) entered into the
world, and death (spiritual death) through sin (negative volition), and so
death (spiritual death) spread to all men, because all sinned when Adam sinned
(imputed sin or Adam’s Original Sin).”  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The old sin nature is the internal source of temptation
to sin. Sin comes from our free will as negative volition in the soul whether
tempted internally or from external sources. Personal sin causes temporal spiritual
death (no fellowship with God) while living on earth.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The condition of the human race is that relative
righteousness (-R) cannot have fellowship with God's absolute righteousness (+R).
We are all born with no human spirit and, therefore, have no ability to
understand spiritual information. 1 Cor. 2:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of
God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because
they are spiritually appraised.” (1 Corinthians 2:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our position in Adam means that we are all born
physically alive, but spiritually dead. The unbeliever is spiritually dead
(under imputed Adam’s Original Sin), has an old sin nature (is a sinner) and is
condemned. John 3:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;He who believes in Him is not judged; he who does not
believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the
only begotten Son of God.” (John 3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Through our free will faith in the work of Jesus Christ
on the Cross for our sins, we become spiritually alive in Christ. As believers,
our new position is now in Christ. 1 Cor. 15:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made
alive.” (1 Corinthians 15:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As believers, our condition is that God imputed His very
own perfect righteousness (+R) to us at  salvation. Our ability to understand
spiritual information was also given through regeneration where we gained a
human spirit. Rom. 8:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are
children of God,” (Romans 8:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer is spiritually alive (under imputed +R), also
has an old sin nature (still a sinner but saved), but is no longer condemned.
John 3:18.  However, the old sin nature is under condemnation per Romans 8:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For what the Law could not do, weak as it was through the
flesh, God did: sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and as an
offering for sin, He condemned sin in the flesh,” (Romans 8:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The remedy for the old sin nature for the believer is spiritual
growth whereby the believer’s soul and thinking becomes renovated by Bible
doctrine in the right lobe of the soul. By growing spiritually, the believer
uses 1 John 1:9 consistently to name their known sins to God the Father and
thereby regain the filling of the Holy Spirit (fellowship with God) and thus being
empowered to learn and apply the promises and mandates of the Word of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The old sin nature in control of the soul causes temporal
spiritual death – being out of fellowship with God. The Holy Spirit in control of
the soul (in fellowship) through the use of confession of sin causes the
restoration of spirituality. 1 John 1:9. </p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>
