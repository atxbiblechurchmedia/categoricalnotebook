<h2><a name="_D-Physical_Death"></a><a name="_Physical_Death"></a>Physical Death
</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Physical death occurs when the soul leaves the physical
body. For believers, the soul and the human spirit remain in the presence of
the Lord until the Rapture, when the dead in Christ rise first. The soul and
human spirit will come down to wherever the death occurred and receive a
resurrection body and meet the Lord in the air. The bodies of the living
believers are changed and they meet the Lord in the air. Phil. 3:21; 2 Cor.
5:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“who will transform the body of our humble state into
conformity with the body of His glory, by the exertion of the power that He has
even to subject all things to Himself.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Philippians 3:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“we are of good courage, I say, and prefer rather to be absent
from the body and to be at home with the Lord.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Corinthians 5:8,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For the unbeliever at physical death, the soul leaves the
body and goes to Hades to await the Last Judgment - the Great White Throne
Judgment. The body is deserted in physical death. The elements that form the
chemistry of the body go into the soil and the air. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The sovereignty of God determines the time, place, and
manner of our physical death. It is part of His plan. When the believer’s
purpose on earth has been completed, God calls us home to be with the Lord. Psalms
68:19-20. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Blessed be the Lord, who daily bears our burden, The God who
is our salvation. Selah. God is to us a God of deliverances; And to GOD the
Lord belong escapes from death.” (Psalms 68:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer’s lifetime can be extended by God. The
believer’s life can also be shortened by reversionism.  The worst-case scenario
for shortening your lifespan is the sin unto death which does not bring glory
to God. Psalms 102:23-24; Prov. 14:27; Psalms 118:18; Isaiah 38:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He has weakened my strength in the way; He has shortened my
days. I say, &quot;O my God, do not take me away in the midst of my days, Your
years are throughout all generations.” (Psalms 102:23-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life, That one may avoid
the snares of death.” (Proverbs 14:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD has disciplined me severely, But He has not given me
over to death.” (Psalms 118:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For Sheol cannot thank You, Death cannot praise You;
Those who go down to the pit cannot hope for Your faithfulness.” (Isaiah 38:18,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Because a believer’s soul is saved, in physical death,
the soul and the human spirit leave the body and go into the presence of the
Lord. 2 Cor. 5:8; Rev. 21:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“we are of good courage, I say, and prefer rather to be absent
from the body and to be at home with the Lord.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Corinthians 5:8,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there
will no longer be any death; there will no longer be any mourning, or crying,
or pain; the first things have passed away.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation 21:4,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 5:8, “absent from the body” means
physical death and “at home with the Lord” means we will instantly be face to
face with Jesus Christ. The soul and human spirit will have perceptive ability
regarding things in heaven in their vicinity, but probably will not be aware of
what is going on down on earth. In Philippians 3:21, the phrase “for to me to
live is Christ” refers to the spiritually mature believer fulfilling God's
purpose for their life via filling of the Holy Spirit and through application
of <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine. “To die is gain” means death for the mature
believer will be even greater than the living the spiritual life. See category
on <a href="#_Doubtful_Things">Dying Grace</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Philippians
1:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 5:1, the phrase “For we know” refers to
believers in the Church Age. “If” is a third class condition - maybe we will,
or maybe we won’t die before the Rapture, which may be any time. The “earthly tent”
is our physical body as a temporary structure. “Torn down” means the body, after
death, returns to the chemicals from which it was made. “Building from God” is
a permanent structure or the resurrection body.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For we know that if the earthly tent which is our house is
torn down, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in
the heavens.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Corinthians 5:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 5:2, the phrase “in this house” refers
to our temporary bodies. “We groan” is in the present tense and means we keep
on groaning. “Longing” means intense desire to be face to face with the Lord. Phil.
1:22-24.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For indeed in this house we groan, longing to be clothed with
our dwelling from heaven,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Corinthians 5:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But if I am to live on in the flesh, this will mean fruitful
labor for me; and I do not know which to choose. But I am hard-pressed from
both directions, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, for that is
very much better; yet to remain on in the flesh is more necessary for your
sake.” (Philippians 1:22-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 5:3, “having put it on” is our
resurrection body and “will not be found naked” refers to physical death before
the Rapture. The physical body (corpse) without the soul and spirit is naked. The
application here is that a casket should never be open in a believer’s funeral.
Heathenism makes much over the corpse.</p>

<p class=Verses>“inasmuch as we, having put it on, will not be found naked.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2
Corinthians 5:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 5:4, “in this tent” refers to those
alive right now and “to be unclothed” means to not be worried about receiving a
resurrection body. “What is mortal will be swallowed up by life” means that we
might enter into the Rapture without physical death.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For indeed while we are in this tent, we groan, being
burdened, because we do not want to be unclothed but to be clothed, so that
what is mortal will be swallowed up by life.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Corinthians 5:4,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 5:5, God has planned that we should have
a resurrection body like the Lord Jesus Christ. He proved this by giving us a
down payment - “gave to us the Spirit” or the indwelling presence of the Holy
Spirit.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now He who prepared us for this very purpose is God, who gave
to us the Spirit as a pledge.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Corinthians 5:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 5:6, “being always of good courage” is
in the present tense and means we are to keep on being of good courage or
having confidence. This should be the normal Christian life. “Knowing” is in
the perfect tense and means knowing the past and we keep on knowing forever. “Home
in the body” means we are still physically alive.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, being always of good courage, and knowing that
while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord—”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2
Corinthians 5:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Believer’s Hope</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Thessalonians 4:13-14, the term “asleep” refers to
sleep of the body. Soul and spirit are never said to sleep. The awakening of
the body is the resurrection. The Thessalonians had been listening to false
teachers regarding those dead in Christ. John 11:25-26; Rev. 21:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But we do not want you to be uninformed, brethren, about those
who are asleep, so that you will not grieve as do the rest who have no hope.
For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with
Him those who have fallen asleep in Jesus.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Thessalonians
4:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life; he who
believes in Me will live even if he dies, and everyone who lives and believes
in Me will never die. Do you believe this?”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 11:25-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there
will no longer be any death; there will no longer be any mourning, or crying,
or pain; the first things have passed away.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation 21:4,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Thessalonians 4:14, the word “if” is a first class
condition (if and we do) and refers to Church Age believers who have died. The
phrase “God will bring with Him” refers to the Second Advent of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Thessalonians 4:15-18, the “dead in Christ” refers
to the Church Universal or the invisible Body of Christ. The soul and spirit at
the Rapture go where the body checked out. They rejoin the body (which has
since become dust in most instances) and the moment the soul and spirit hits
the body, it becomes a new resurrection body. The dead in Christ rise first,
then the living believers are caught up and they all rendezvous with the Lord
in the air.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who
are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who
have fallen asleep.&nbsp;For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a
shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, and the
dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain will be caught
up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we
shall always be with the Lord. Therefore comfort one another with these words.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Thessalonians 4:15-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Children who have not reached the age of accountability
(where their volition is operative) will go to heaven (Christ died for all -
Unlimited Atonement). Children who have reached the age of accountability and
remain unbelievers will stay on earth.</p>
