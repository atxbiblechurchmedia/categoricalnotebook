Deuteronomy 5:1-21. The Ten Commandments include morality only because morality

human freedom in personally believing in Jesus Christ. This portion of the
Mosaic Law includes Scripture relating to Christ and His time here in the earth
as in Exodus 25-31. Codex #3 presents the Laws of Divine Establishment and how
they bless a national entity as presented in Exodus 21-25.</p>

comprehensible to the unbeliever. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Confess: The mandate to every believer to simply name,
cite, admit, or acknowledge sins in privacy to God the Father (1 John 1:9). </p>

the time of Christ, the hands and feet were bound or nailed to a cross-beam.
Jesus Christ died physically on the Cross following His substitutionary
spiritual death for all of the sins of mankind (see Unlimited Atonement).  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Cycles of Discipline: The Cycles of Discipline are
national judgment from God in five progressively intense stages for
disobedience to God’s Word. God’s justice must judge nations with punitive
measures against apostasy, reversionism, and evil. The five cycles of
discipline are described in Leviticus 26:14-46. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>First Cycle of Discipline</i>: Loss of health, decline
of agricultural prosperity, terror, fear and death in combat, loss of personal
freedoms due to negative volition toward Bible doctrine. Lev. 26:14-17. </p>

<p class=Verses>“'But if you do not obey Me and do not carry out all these
commandments, if, instead, you reject My statutes, and if your soul abhors My
ordinances so as not to carry out all My commandments, and so break My
covenant, I, in turn, will do this to you: I will appoint over you a sudden
terror, consumption and fever that will waste away the eyes and cause the soul
to pine away; also, you will sow your seed uselessly, for your enemies will eat
it up. 'I will set My face against you so that you will be struck down before
your enemies; and those who hate you will rule over you, and you will flee when
no one is pursuing you.” (Leviticus 26:14-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Second Cycle of Discipline</i>: Economic recession and
depression, increased personal and individual discipline for continued negative
attitude in spite of the first warning. Lev. 26:18-20. </p>

<p class=Verses>“'If also after these things you do not obey Me, then I will
punish you seven times more for your sins. 'I will also break down your pride
of power; I will also make your sky like iron and your earth like bronze. 'Your
strength will be spent uselessly, for your land will not yield its produce and
the trees of the land will not yield their fruit.” (Leviticus 26:18-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Third Cycle of Discipline</i>: Violence and breakdown
of law and order; cities broken up. There will be increased internal violence.
Lev. 26:21-22. </p>

<p class=Verses>“'If then, you act with hostility against Me and are unwilling
to obey Me, I will increase the plague on you seven times according to your
sins. 'I will let loose among you the beasts of the field, which will bereave
you of your children and destroy your cattle and reduce your number so that
your roads lie deserted.” (Leviticus 26:21-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i> Fourth Cycle of Discipline</i>: Military conquest and
foreign occupation, scarcity of food (reduced to one-tenth of the normal
supply), the breaking up of families. Lev. 26:23-26. See also Deut. 28:15-48,
where the listing of the five cycles is not progressive, but is specified as
part of the same curse.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“'And if by these things you are not turned to Me, but act with
hostility against Me, then I will act with hostility against you; and I, even
I, will strike you seven times for your sins. 'I will also bring upon you a
sword which will execute vengeance for the covenant; and when you gather
together into your cities, I will send pestilence among you, so that you shall
be delivered into enemy hands. 'When I break your staff of bread, ten women
will bake your bread in one oven, and they will bring back your bread in
rationed amounts, so that you will eat and not be satisfied.” (Leviticus
26:23-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Fifth Cycle of Discipline</i>: Destruction of a nation
due to maximum rejection of biblical principles. Lev. 26:27-46; Deut. 28:49-57.
</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;'Yet if in spite of this you do not obey Me, but act with
hostility against Me, then I will act with wrathful hostility against you, and
I, even I, will punish you seven times for your sins.&quot;  (Leviticus
26:27-28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;'Further, you will eat the flesh of your sons and the
flesh of your daughters you will eat. 'I then will destroy your high places,
and cut down your incense altars, and heap your remains on the remains of your
idols, for My soul shall abhor you.&quot;  (Leviticus 26:29-30, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;'I will lay waste your cities as well and will make your
sanctuaries desolate, and I will not smell your soothing aromas. 'I will make
the land desolate so that your enemies who settle in it will be appalled over
it.&quot;  (Leviticus 26:31-32, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;'But you will perish among the nations, and your enemies'
land will consume you. 'So those of you who may be left will rot away because
of their iniquity in the lands of your enemies; and also because of the
iniquities of their forefathers they will rot away with them.&quot;  (Leviticus
26:38-39, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Deity: The character or nature of God. Jesus Christ true
humanity and undiminished deity. See Hypostatic Union. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Demonology: The doctrine of demons (fallen angels).</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Devil: From the Greek word meaning “accuser, adversary.”
Satan, the enemy of God, elect angels, and all believers. First known as
Lucifer. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Dialectic materialism: The basic doctrine of Communism.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Dichotomous: Composed of only two parts - body and soul.
All people are born dichotomous. Believers become trichotomous by God the Holy
Spirit’s imputation of a human spirit at salvation. All unbelievers remain
dichotomous. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Dispensations: A period of time in which God specifies a
way of life for believers and reveals to unbelievers through revelation and
activity which He authorizes, that man is incapable of having fellowship with
God. The divine outline of history or the divine interpretation of human
history. The dispensations of human history and the future of mankind include
the Age of the Gentiles, the Age of the Jews, the Church Age, the Tribulation,
and the Millennium.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divine Decree: God's eternal, holy, wise, and sovereign
purpose comprehending simultaneously in eternity past all things that ever were
or will be in their causes, conditions, successions, relations, and determining
their certain future existence. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divine Essence: Characteristics or attributes of the
Godhead. What God is like.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divine Establishment: Principles set up by God for the
protection, orderly function, survival and perpetuation of the human race
during the period of the Angelic Conflict. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divine Good: Good Christian service or deeds performed by
a believer using God's grace resources and who is filled with the Holy Spirit
when doing so. This is the opposite of human good. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divine Institutions: Principles set up by God under the
Laws of Divine Establishment for the perpetuation of the human race. They are:
1) Volition which is the free will basis of freedom, 2) Marriage which is the
stabilizer of the human race, 3) Family which is the basis for an orderly
society, and 4) Nationalism which is the basis for privacy, protection of
rights, and freedom. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divine Judgment: God's punishment for those who disobey
Him. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Doctrine: The teaching of God’s Word categorically.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ecclesiology: The doctrine of the Church. The Church is
the organized local church and universal church as the Body of Christ. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Edification Complex of the Soul - Immaterial “structure”
in the soul of a mature believer. The foundation is doctrine stored in the
right lobe of the soul. Composed of five “floors”: grace orientation; relaxed
mental attitude; mastery of the details of life; capacity to love God, your
right man or right woman and your friends; inner happiness. From the Bible
doctrine in the Edification Complex of the Soul, the believer can apply doctrine
to life’s situations.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Efficacious Grace: A specific ministry of the Holy Spirit
whereby the faith of a spiritually dead person is acknowledged and made
effective for salvation. Without the work of the Holy Spirit, the volition of
an unbeliever could never result in eternal life. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Elect Angel: Spirit-beings who obeyed God and refused to
follow Satan. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Elohim: Plural Hebrew word meaning unity of the Trinity;
all three persons of the Trinity. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Emotional Revolt of the Soul: The principle whereby the
emotional response to the old sin nature controls the essence of the soul,
contrary to the divine order whereby the heart or right lobe should control the
soul. This results in wide emotional swings and misery heaped on misery.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Eschatology: The branch of theology concerned with the
end of the world or of humankind. The study of all Scriptures which were
predictive when written and the completion of the plan of the ages. The
doctrine of “last things.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Essence of God: The nature or essential being of the
person of God. The individual qualities or characteristics which are intrinsic
to the essence of God. Same as Attributes of God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Eternal: Having no beginning or ending. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Eternal Life: The attribute of God that describes His
absolute existence outside the boundaries of time. An everlasting relationship
with God reserved in heaven for every person the moment they express faith in
Jesus Christ as their Savior. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Eternal Security: Based on God’s character, believers in
union with Christ cannot lose their salvation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Eve: From the Hebrew word meaning “Mother of all Living.”
The woman God made from Adam's rib. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Exegesis: The grammatical, etymological interpretation of
Scripture from its original languages. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Exodus: God's deliverance of Israel from their slavery in
Egypt to their new home in the Promised Land. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Expiation: The cancellation of the debt for the penalty
of sin because of Christ’s work on the Cross. The penalty of sin is spiritual
death or the separation from God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Faith: A non-meritorious system of perception based on
confidence and trust in the authority and veracity of God. Confident belief in
the truth. Belief and trust in God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Faith-Rest: Mixing the promises of God with faith which
is believing God and His Word as seen in Hebrews 4:1-2. This problem-solving
capability is used more correctly and consistently as the believer approaches
spiritual maturity. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, let us fear if, while a promise remains of entering
His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short of it. For indeed we have
had good news preached to us, just as they also; but the word they heard did
not profit them, because it was not united by faith in those who heard.”
(Hebrews 4:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Fallen Angel: Spirit-beings who disobeyed God and
followed Satan. Same as demons.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Fifth Cycle of Discipline: Destruction of a nation by God
due to maximum rejection of biblical principles. Lev. 26:27-46. See Cycles of
Discipline.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Filling of the Holy Spirit: The absolute status of being
in fellowship with God commanded to every Church Age believer for the purpose
of divine empowerment for the Christian life. The opportunity to use the
enabling power of God the Holy Spirit to execute the Christian life. This
condition may be lost through sinning, but is recovered through privately
naming or acknowledging sins to God the Father. See Confession of Sin.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Format Soul: The home for the immaterial soul, which is
imparted by God at birth. This format for the soul derives from the genes of
both parents and develops as biological life in the cranial area of the fetus.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Garden of Eden: The perfect place created by God where
Adam and Eve before they sinned. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Gnosticism: False teaching which tries to reconcile Bible
doctrine, philosophy, heathenism and Judaism. It claims all matter is evil
(Plato). </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God-Consciousness: Recognition of the existence of a supreme
being. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Father: First Person of the Trinity; designed the
plan of salvation for all mankind and a personal destiny for every believer;
the Person to whom we pray.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Holy Spirit: Third Person of the Trinity; enables
us to learn Bible doctrine, live the Christian way of life, and please God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Son: Jesus Christ, the Second Person of the
Trinity, who became the unique God-Man, the Savior, who died on the Cross as a
substitute for everyone so those who believe in Him can live forever with God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Grace: What God has done and will do for man because
Christ died for them. Grace is undeserved and unmerited. God's unearned,
undeserved love toward all human beings. The title of God's plan for mankind. A
free gift. Mankind through his own work can never accomplish or achieve the
notice or favor of God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Grace Apparatus for Perception (GAP): The divine
provision for spiritual growth whereby every believer can understand every
doctrine, regardless of education or human IQ. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Hamartiology: A theological term for the study or
doctrine of sin. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Hardening of the Heart: The development of “scar tissue”
of the soul. Negative volition toward God or Bible doctrine results in
hardening of the heart toward God and doctrine. Promiscuity, drug addiction,
alcoholism, or any other frantic search for happiness hardens the heart which
means that no meaningful soul activity with other people is possible. A stage
of reversionism in which the believer becomes entrenched in some form of
negative volition through reactor factors in the soul, leading to a frantic search
for happiness and emotional revolt in the soul. This opens a vacuum into the
soul (Eph. 4:17), which fills the left (perceptive) lobe with doctrines of
demons and/or evil and results in the blackout of doctrine in the left lobe.
This leads to hardness of the heart (Eph. 4:18) and therefore to total lack of
soul capacity toward God. See Scar Tissue of the Soul.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So this I say, and affirm together with the Lord, that you
walk no longer just as the Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their mind,
being darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life of God because of
the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart;”
(Ephesians 4:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Heart: The dominant or right lobe of the mentality of the
soul where believed (<i>epignosis</i>) Bible doctrine is stored for
application. It is where the conscience, norms and standards and viewpoint
reside. See Right Lobe.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Heathen: Anyone who does not believe in Jesus Christ for
salvation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Heathenism: Unbelief or rejection either at the point of
God consciousness or upon hearing the Gospel. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Heaven: The home of God and of all believers in eternity;
the place of perfect happiness. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Heavens: The sun, moon, and stars; the galaxies and all of
the universe. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Hermeneutics: The science of interpretation of the Bible
and the methods of that interpretation. Biblical hermeneutics follow the I.C.E.
principles of interpretation – Isagogics, Categories, Exegesis.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Homo Sapiens: The Latin word for mankind.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Human Good: Good deeds produced under the control of the
sin nature. The believer with unconfessed sin in their life is not spiritual
but carnal (soul is controlled by the sin nature). The good deeds of a carnal
Christian are indistinguishable from good deeds performed by an unbeliever and
have no spiritual value. This is the opposite of divine good. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Humanity: The character and nature of man. Jesus Christ
is perfect and true humanity with no sin nature.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Human Life: The union of soul life and biological life at
the moment the fetus emerges from the womb when God imparts the first “breath
of life.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Human Spirit: The invisible part of the believer gained
at salvation designed by God to allow the believer to understand Bible doctrine
taught via the power of the Holy Spirit. This spiritually understood
information is then transferred by the Holy Spirit to the left lobe of the soul
as <i>gnosis</i> or understood knowledge. The human spirit is also the home for
eternal life imputed to the believer by God the Father at salvation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Hypostatic Union: A distinctly theological term
applicable exclusively to Jesus Christ in whom two distinct and independent
natures, divine and human, are united. In the person of Jesus Christ are two
natures inseparably united without mixture or loss of separate identity and
without loss or transfer of properties or attributes. The union is both
personal and eternal.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“ICE” Teaching: Includes isagogics, categories, and
exegesis. The fundamental requirement for correct teaching of the Word of God
or “rightly dividing the Word of Truth.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Image of God: The immaterial, invisible essence of
mankind. The pattern God used to create mankind was Himself. Our essence
includes volition, emotion, self-consciousness, conscience, and mentality.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Immanence: A theological term used to describe God as
ubiquitous and pervasive in His creation, in history, in all the affairs of
mankind. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Immediate Creation: The direct creative act of God apart
from intermediate agents or means. Adam was created immediately by God as is
the soul of every human being.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Immutability: One of the attributes of God that describes
His inability to change. He is not susceptible to or capable of change. He is
absolute, unalterable stability. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Immutable: Unchangeable</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Impeccability: Christ was sinless on earth because He had
no sin nature or imputed sin and he had never committed any acts of personal
sin.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Imputation: The judicial act of crediting a debit or
credit to someone's account. The condemnation of Adam's original sin is given
to each person at birth. The act of God the Father whereby He credits His very
own perfect absolute righteousness to the believer in Christ. God's eternal
life is also credited to each person at the moment of faith in Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Impute: To assign or credit something to someone.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Incarnation: God becoming flesh and taking the form of
man. The time Jesus Christ, the second person of the Trinity, lived on the
earth in hypostatic union. (see Hypostatic Union). </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Indwelling of the Holy Spirit: A permanent status
acquired at the moment of salvation by every Church Age believer which
transforms the believer’s human body into a temple for the simultaneous
indwelling of the deity of Jesus Christ. See Shekinah Glory. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Inspiration: God so supernaturally directed the writers
of Scripture that without waiving their human intelligence, literary style, or
personal feelings, or any other human factor, His complete and coherent message
to man was recorded with perfect accuracy, the very words of the original
Scripture bearing the authority of divine authorship.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Integrity of God: The combination of the divine
attributes of righteousness and justice to form God's holiness. The totality of
divine perfection. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Isagogics: The interpretation of the Bible in its
historical setting. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Israel: The Old Testament nation, God's chosen people,
the Jews. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jehovah: A title of God derived from the sacred
Tetragrammaton (four letters). Refers to all three members of the Trinity. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ: The Son of God; the Second Person of the
Trinity's name after the Incarnation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jews: God's chosen people. A race of people descended
from Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Justice: The attribute of God that describes His infinite
fairness in blessing, reward, judgment, and condemnation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Justification: The judicial act of God whereby He imputes
His perfect righteousness to everyone who believes in Jesus Christ and declares
them righteous. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Kenosis: Jesus Christ voluntarily restricted the
independent use of His relative divine attributes in compliance with the
Father's plan for His incarnation. The word “kenosis” is derived from the Greek
word κενόω (kenoō) found in Philippians 2:7 translated “emptied” and means to
empty oneself or to deprive oneself of a proper function. The Lord Jesus Christ
voluntarily took on Himself the form of true humanity in order to redeem
mankind from sin, in order to propitiate God the Father, and to reconcile
mankind to God. Therefore, during the incarnation, Jesus Christ did not even
once exercise the independent use of His own divine attributes either to
benefit Himself, to provide for Himself, or to glorify Himself. </p>

<p class=Verses>“but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and
being made in the likeness of men.” (Philippians 2:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Lake of Fire: The final abode for all unbelievers and
fallen angels who remain eternally condemned and separated from God in a place
of eternal burning and punishment originally created for Satan and the fallen
angels. This is the final destination of all unbelievers who are sentenced by
the Lord Jesus Christ at the Last Judgment. Matt. 25:41; Rev. 20:1-15. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Then He will also say to those on His left, 'Depart from
Me, accursed ones, into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil
and his angels;” (Matthew 25:41, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Last Judgment: The unbeliever's separation from God for
all eternity. Also called the Second Death. Rev. 20:11. </p>

whose presence earth and heaven fled away, and no place was found for them.”
(Revelation 20:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Laws of Divine Establishment: Principles set up by God
for the protection, orderly function, survival and perpetuation of the human
race during the period of the Angelic Conflict. The laws of divine
establishment define freedom in terms of privacy, property and authority. The
laws of divine establishment provide the freedom in a nation to fulfill God's plan.
These freedoms are designed for believers and unbelievers to function under
many different types of government. Divine establishment laws depend on
authority orientation and directly affects freedom, civilization, authority,
evangelism, spiritual growth, and perpetuation of the human race. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Legalism: Any attempt to win God's favor or to gain
salvation or spirituality by human merit or effort. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Logistical Grace: God's complete provision of every
physical and spiritual need for every believer regardless of their spiritual
status. Logistical grace keeps the believer alive, provides access to Bible
doctrine, and enables him to grow spiritually in the devil's world. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Love: God's attitude of esteem and regard toward Himself
and His concern, mercy, and benevolence toward His created beings. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Love Categories: love toward God, love between a man and
woman, and love toward friends. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Lucifer: From the Hebrew word meaning “bright, morning
star.” The angel who guarded the throne of God. The name of Satan before he
sinned.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mediate Creation: The indirect creative act of God
through intermediate agents or means. All biological life since the original
creation of Adam has been formed mediately through human procreation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mediator: One who is equal with both parties of a
mediation and therefore acts as a go-between.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Messiah: Literally means “the Anointed One” in Hebrew,
parallel to “Christ” in Greek, indicating Jesus' offices of prophet, priest,
and king to Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Millennium: The last 1,000 literal years of human history
in which the Lord Jesus Christ will reign and produce perfect environment on

Israel and gave Moses the Ten Commandments. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mystery: Bible doctrine hidden from those living prior to
the Church Age (Old Testament believers) but now revealed through the Canon of
Scripture (the New Testament of the Bible). </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Necromancy: The practice of attempting communicating with
the spirits of the dead in order to seek information or to predict the future.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Neshamah: Hebrew word <span lang=HE dir=RTL>נשׁמה</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (neshâmâh) translated the “breath of
life” from God which imparts the human soul to the mediately formed human body
at birth. Gen. 2:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD God formed man of dust from the ground, and
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being.”
(Genesis 2:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>New Testament: The second part of the Bible from Matthew
to Revelation. God's message after Jesus Christ was born. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Old Sin Nature: The flawed character possessed by every
human being which tempts us to sin. The old sin nature is the source of
temptation to commit personal sins and depends on human good production to gain
acceptance from God. This always results in contributing to the evil of Satan’s
world system. The old sin nature is also the center of corruption and rebellion
against God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The old sin nature is an integral part of every human
being which resides in the cell structure of the human body as seen in Romans
6:6, Romans 7:5, and Romans 7:18. The old sin nature was acquired originally by
Adam at his fall and is transmitted only by the male sperm that fertilizes the
female ovum. Gen. 5:3. The result is both spiritual death and total depravity
of all humanity and the sovereignty of the sin nature over human life. Rom.
6:12. Jesus Christ was unique humanity because He was born as a result of the
Holy Spirit fertilizing Mary (virgin pregnancy leading to the virgin birth).
Because no male human contributed any chromosomes, the old sin nature was not
passed on. Therefore, Jesus Christ was born without an old sin nature. </p>

<p class=Verses>“knowing this, that our old self was crucified with Him, in
order that our body of sin might be done away with, so that we would no longer
be slaves to sin;” (Romans 6:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For while we were in the flesh, the sinful passions, which
were aroused by the Law, were at work in the members of our body to bear fruit
for death.” (Romans 7:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my
flesh; for the willing is present in me, but the doing of the good is not.”
(Romans 7:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“When Adam had lived one hundred and thirty years, he became
the father of a son in his own likeness, according to his image, and named him
Seth.” (Genesis 5:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you
obey its lusts,” (Romans 6:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The old sin nature is composed of an area of strength
which produces human good, an area of weakness which produces personal sins,
trends toward legalism or antinomianism, and lust patterns. The old sin nature
is also called the “old self” in Ephesians 4:22, the “flesh” in Romans 8:3-4, and
the principle of “sin” in Romans 7:8-20. Same as Sin Nature.</p>

<p class=Verses>“that, in reference to your former manner of life, you lay
aside the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of
deceit,” (Ephesians 4:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For what the Law could not do, weak as it was through the
flesh, God did: sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and as an
offering for sin, He condemned sin in the flesh, so that the requirement of the
Law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but
according to the Spirit.” (Romans 8:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Old Testament: The first part of the Bible from Genesis
to Malachi. God’s message to mankind before the First Advent of Jesus Christ. </p>

authority, or force. All powerful. One of God's attributes of unlimited power
and authority to accomplish anything He wills. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Omnipresence: God's presence everywhere in the universe
simultaneously. One of God's attributes of eternal and simultaneous presence in
every place. He is not subject to the limitations of space and time. See
Immanence and Transcendence. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Omniscience: Total knowledge. One of God's attributes of
infinite and eternal knowledge of all things past, present, and future which
either have happened, could happen, or will happen including all of the
possible alternatives. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Parable: A short, fictitious narrative which illustrates
a principle of Bible doctrine. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Phallic Cult: A system of religion which involved
idolatry and fornication in the worship of Baal and the other members of the Canaanitic
pantheon. Exod. 34:12-16; Lev. 18; 1 Kings 14:15; 2 Chron. 33:3; Jer. 17:2. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Watch yourself that you make no covenant with the
inhabitants of the land into which you are going, or it will become a snare in
your midst. &quot;But rather, you are to tear down their altars and smash their
sacred pillars and cut down their Asherim” (Exodus 34:12-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For the LORD will strike Israel, as a reed is shaken in
the water; and He will uproot Israel from this good land which He gave to their
fathers, and will scatter them beyond the Euphrates River, because they have
made their Asherim, provoking the LORD to anger.” (1 Kings 14:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For he rebuilt the high places which Hezekiah his father had
broken down; he also erected altars for the Baals and made Asherim, and
worshiped all the host of heaven and served them.” (2 Chronicles 33:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“As they remember their children, So they remember their altars
and their Asherim By green trees on the high hills.” (Jeremiah 17:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Physical Death: For the unbeliever, when the soul
separates from the physical body. For the believer, when the soul and human
spirit separate from the physical body.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Pneumatology: The doctrine of the person and work of the
Holy Spirit. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Positional Truth: The doctrine that every believer is
placed into union with Jesus Christ by the Holy Spirit at the point of
salvation resulting in every believer being “in Christ.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Prodigal: A reckless and extravagantly wasteful person. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Progress of Revelation: God’s revelation of Himself to
man has been gradual through time and is now completed in the Bible.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Propitiation: To be satisfied. An aspect of the saving
work of God through the substitutionary spiritual death of Jesus Christ on the Cross
whereby the justice and righteousness of God were satisfied concerning the sins
of mankind. God the Father was propitiated by the work of Jesus Christ on the
Cross. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Rapture: The resurrection, rendezvous, or meeting of all
dead and living Church Age believers from the earth at the end of the present
age, the Church Age. All Church Age believers will physically meet the Lord in
the air and receive their resurrection bodies. These believers constitute the
Bride of Christ as stated in 1 Thessalonians 4:14-17. The Rapture will signal
the end of the Church Age and the beginning of the Tribulation. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God
will bring with Him those who have fallen asleep in Jesus. For this we say to
you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming
of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep. For the Lord
Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel
and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we
who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to
meet the Lord in the air, and so we shall always be with the Lord.” (1
Thessalonians 4:14-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Reconciliation: The sum total of all that Christ did on
the Cross in removing the insurmountable barrier and natural antagonism between
God and sinful man. God is propitiated, man is reconciled. This is the manward
side of the Cross. Reconciliation removes the barrier between God’s perfect
righteousness and man’s personal sin, the penalty of sin, man's position in
Adam, man’s physical birth, and man's relative righteousness. Rom. 5:11. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And not only this, but we also exult in God through our Lord
Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.” (Romans
5:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Redemption: The saving work of Jesus Christ on the Cross
whereby all humanity is bought from the slave market of sin in which they were
born and delivered to the freedom of grace. Jesus Christ paid the ransom by His
blood, which represents His substitutionary spiritual death on the Cross. 1
Peter 1:18-19. Redemption is realized when a person is born again by faith
alone in Christ alone. </p>

<p class=Verses>“knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable things like
silver or gold from your futile way of life inherited from your forefathers,
but with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and spotless, the blood of
Christ.” (1 Peter 1:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Regeneration: The theological term for spiritual birth or
being “born again” at the point of salvation. The imputation of eternal life at
the moment anyone believes in Jesus Christ for eternal salvation. A regenerate
person passes from spiritual death to spiritual life. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Relative Righteousness: Man's standards are adequate only
in comparison or relative to other humans, but are totally inadequate when
compared to God's absolute or perfect standards. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Religion: Man, by his own efforts, trying to gain
salvation or the approbation of God. Religion is the Devil’s “ace trump.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Repentance: A complete change of mental attitude. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Resurrection: A theological term that means to be
physically raised from the dead and to receive an immortal body just like that
received by Jesus Christ upon His resurrection. Resurrection is in contrast to
resuscitation where a dead person is restored alive to his mortal body, but
subsequently dies again. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Restoration: God the Holy Spirit's act of remaking the
earth after Lucifer sinned and it became desolate and uninhabitable. The Holy
Spirit restored earth into a perfect environment for the human race. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Revelation: God's message to mankind about Himself and
His plan for believers. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Reversionism: Continual prolonged carnality of the
believer. This is a recession from any stage of spiritual growth and is
characterized by negative volition toward Bible doctrine, emotional revolt of
the soul, apostasy, and scar tissue of the soul. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Righteousness: The attribute of God that describes the
absolute perfection of His character and Person. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Right Lobe: The dominant lobe of the mentality of the
soul designated by the Greek word <i>kardia</i> (usually translated “heart”),
in contrast to the left or perceptive lobe - <i>nous</i> which is a staging
area only for knowledge. The right lobe has five areas. The first is the frame
of reference with its memory center which is the final storage place for all
knowledge and is the basis for learning new knowledge. The second is the conscience
where your norms and standards reside. The third area is your vocabulary in which
categories are formed. The fourth area is viewpoint where we use vocabulary,
conscience, and your frame of reference which leads to a viewpoint of life on
any given subject. The fifth area of the soul is a “launching pad” for
application of Bible doctrine to your life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Royal Family of God: A biblical term derived from the
term “sons of God” and describes the familial relationship between God and the
believer. Every believer is related to the kingly lineage of Jesus Christ
through the new birth. Same as the Church and the Body of Christ. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sanctification: A state of being set apart unto God. The
English terms saint, sanctify, and holy are derived from the same Greek root. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan: From the Hebrew word meaning “accuser.” The enemy
of God, the elect angels, and all Christians. The leader of the fallen angels. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scar Tissue: The concept of “hardening of the heart.”
Negative volition toward God or Bible doctrine puts scar tissue on the soul
whereby the heart becomes “hardened” toward God and doctrine. Promiscuity, drug
addiction. alcoholism, or any other frantic search for happiness puts scar
tissue on the soul which means that no meaningful soul activity with other
people is possible. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scar tissue is a stage of reversionism in which the
believer becomes entrenched in some form of negative volition through reactor
factors in the soul, leading to a frantic search for happiness and emotional
revolt in the soul. This opens a vacuum into the soul (Ephesians 4:17), which
fills the left (perceptive) lobe with doctrines of demons and/or evil and
results in the blackout of doctrine in the left lobe. This leads to the
accumulation of scar tissue on the right lobe or hardness of the heart
(Ephesians. 4:18) and therefore to total lack of soul capacity toward God. </p>

<p class=Verses>“So this I say, and affirm together with the Lord, that you
walk no longer just as the Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their mind,
being darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life of God because of
the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart;”
(Ephesians 4:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Second Advent: The doctrine that Jesus Christ, who died,
was resurrected and ascended to the Father in the third heaven, will one day
again personally return to this earth in power and glory. His return will
signal the end of the Tribulation and the beginning of the Millennium.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Second Death: The entrance of all unbelievers and fallen
angels into the Lake of Fire at the end of the Great White Throne Judgement
immediately following the Millennial reign of Jesus Christ on the Earth. All of
those found in God's Book of Life (believers in Jesus Christ as their personal
Savior) are promised by God that the second death has no claim on them. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Seminal Presence in Adam: Seminal presence in Adam means
we were all present with Adam because we are all genetically derived from him.
We are his seed. Therefore, the entire human race was present when Adam sinned,
which resulted in depravity of the nature of mankind. We all share Adam's
corrupt nature. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Senatus Populusque Romanus: Latin for “The Senate and
People of Rome.” Abbreviated as SPQR.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Serpent: The beautiful creature in the garden of Eden
that Satan used to convince Eve to disobey God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Shekinah Glory: As the visible manifestation of God’s
glory, the Second Person of the Trinity who dwelt with Israel in the sacred
Tabernacle or Temple. His presence in the Holy of Holies was demonstrated by a
brilliant cloud in the daytime above the Tabernacle and a pillar of fire at
nighttime. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sin: Any mental, verbal, or overt activity that violates
the perfect righteousness of God. To think, say, or do what God says is wrong
whether you know it is wrong or whether you were unaware of what God says is
wrong. To break one of God's rules, to say no to God, or to disobey God in any
way. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sin Nature: The flawed character possessed by every human
being which tempts us to sin. The sin nature is the source of temptation to
commit personal sins and depends on human good production to gain acceptance
from God. This always results in contributing to the evil of Satan’s world
system. The sin nature is also the center of corruption and rebellion against
God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The sin nature is an integral part of every human being
which resides in the cell structure of the human body as seen in Romans 6:6,
Romans 7:5, and Romans 7:18. The old sin nature was acquired originally by Adam
at his fall and is transmitted only by the male sperm that fertilizes the
female ovum. Gen. 5:3. The result is both spiritual death and total depravity
of all humanity and the sovereignty of the sin nature over human life. Rom.
6:12. Jesus Christ was unique humanity because He was born as a result of the
Holy Spirit fertilizing Mary (virgin pregnancy leading to the virgin birth).
Because no male human contributed any chromosomes, the sin nature was not
passed on. Therefore, Jesus Christ was born without a sin nature. </p>

order that our body of sin might be done away with, so that we would no longer
be slaves to sin;” (Romans 6:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For while we were in the flesh, the sinful passions, which
were aroused by the Law, were at work in the members of our body to bear fruit
for death.” (Romans 7:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my
flesh; for the willing is present in me, but the doing of the good is not.”
(Romans 7:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“When Adam had lived one hundred and thirty years, he became
the father of a son in his own likeness, according to his image, and named him
Seth.” (Genesis 5:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you
obey its lusts,” (Romans 6:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The sin nature is composed of an area of strength which
produces human good, an area of weakness which produces personal sins, trends
toward legalism or antinomianism, and lust patterns. The sin nature is also
called the “old self” in Ephesians 4:22, the “flesh” in Romans 8:3-4, and the
principle of “sin” in Romans 7:8-20. Same as Old Sin Nature.</p>

<p class=Verses>“that, in reference to your former manner of life, you lay
aside the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of
deceit,” (Ephesians 4:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For what the Law could not do, weak as it was through the
flesh, God did: sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and as an
offering for sin, He condemned sin in the flesh, so that the requirement of the
Law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but
according to the Spirit.” (Romans 8:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual Death: Separation from God. The inability to

5:21. Of the rest of the human race, as we are born condemned, the natural
progeny of fallen Adam: “the wages of sin (Adam's original sin) is death
(divine condemnation, not physical death).” Rom. 6:23; Rom. 5:12; Gen. 2:17. </p>

Satan and crowning of the King. The believer is identified with the strategic
