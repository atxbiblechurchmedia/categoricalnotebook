<h2>The Unbeliever’s Death </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The human race is divided into two groups - the believer
who has accepted Jesus Christ as Savior and the unbeliever who has rejected
Jesus Christ as Savior. John 3:36.</p>

<p class=Verses>““He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who does
not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(John
3:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The unbeliever goes through life with only one birth. He
has only a body and a human soul. No new birth, therefore no human spirit. His
human spirit is dormant, not active. When the unbeliever dies, his soul remains
alive, leaves the body and goes to a place called Torments - a compartment of
Hades or Sheol. This is a temporary place of suffering of the soul (no second
chance) until the final disposition of the body at the Last Judgment. Torments
is not Purgatory. Purgatory is not mentioned in the Word of God. The unbeliever’s
rejection of Jesus Christ becomes a permanent decision at physical death. There
is no second chance.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For the believer in eternity there is no more sorrow or
tears or suffering. Rev. 21:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there
will no longer be any death; there will no longer be any mourning, or crying,
or pain; the first things have passed away.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation 21:4,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the case of the unbeliever, the soul will sorrow
eternally. Luke 16:19-24. This is the “weeping” mentioned in Matthew 22:13,
Matthew 24:51, Matthew 25:30, and Luke 13:28.</p>

<p class=Verses> ““Now there was a rich man, and he habitually dressed in
purple and fine linen, joyously living in splendor every day. “And a poor man
named Lazarus was laid at his gate, covered with sores, and longing to be fed
with the crumbs which were falling from the rich man’s table; besides, even the
dogs were coming and licking his sores. “Now the poor man died and was carried
away by the angels to Abraham’s bosom; and the rich man also died and was
buried. “In Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torment, and saw Abraham far
away and Lazarus in his bosom. “And he cried out and said, ‘Father Abraham,
have mercy on me, and send Lazarus so that he may dip the tip of his finger in
water and cool off my tongue, for I am in agony in this flame.’“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Luke
16:19-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““Then the king said to the servants, ‘Bind him hand and foot,
and throw him into the outer darkness; in that place there will be weeping and
gnashing of teeth.’“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 22:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and will cut him in pieces and assign him a place with the
hypocrites; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew
24:51, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““Throw out the worthless slave into the outer darkness; in
that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew
25:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth
when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of
God, but yourselves being thrown out.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Luke 13:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the second resurrection (unto damnation – the Great
White Throne), the soul of the unbeliever will be resurrected with some kind of
body for the flames of the Lake of Fire. Matt. 10:28.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Do not fear those who kill the body but are unable to kill
the soul; but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in
hell.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 10:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>From then on, the soul and the body suffer, for the
unbeliever is then cast into the Lake of Fire, which has already been prepared
for Satan and his angels. Matt. 25:41. This is the second death - eternity in
the Lake of Fire. The second death, in Rev. 20:14, is a perpetuation of
spiritual death into eternity. It is eternal separation from God. </p>

<p class=Verses>““Then He will also say to those on His left, ‘Depart from Me,
accursed ones, into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and
his angels;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 25:41, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This
is the second death, the lake of fire.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation 20:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 5:29, the second resurrection is called a
resurrection of judgment or condemnation.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and will come forth; those who did the good deeds to a
resurrection of life, those who committed the evil deeds to a resurrection of
judgment.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 5:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The unbeliever is resurrected in his body of corruption
so that he might receive his final judgment (wrath) from Jesus Christ at the
Great White Throne Judgment. The unbeliever’s judgment to the Lake of Fire will
not be for all of his good deeds, but for his rejection of Jesus Christ. Rom.
2:5. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But because of your stubbornness and unrepentant heart you are
storing up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath and revelation of the
righteous judgment of God,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 2:5, NASB)</p>
