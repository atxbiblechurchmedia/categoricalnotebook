<h2><a name="_Dying_Grace"></a>Decision Making </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Moses applied five grace principles in making his
decision to identify with his people instead of Egypt. Remember, Moses was the
heir to the throne of Egypt and would have been one of the greatest Pharaohs of
all time. Heb. 11:24-26.</p>

<p class=Verses>“By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the
son of Pharaoh’s daughter, choosing rather to endure ill-treatment with the
people of God than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin, considering the
reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he was
looking to the reward.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 11:24-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The phrase “By faith” refers to the process of making a
decision used by Moses. He was in fellowship and used faith-rest. In decision
making, make sure you are in fellowship and thus filled with the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The phrase “refused to be called” refers to decision
making. In making a decision, one must be able to refuse and choose. This is
thinking divine viewpoint versus human viewpoint. This is application of <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the soul. Many people cannot make a
decision because they cannot refuse. They want the best of two worlds.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 11:24-26, “choosing rather” refers to Moses in
considering the facts, he took in the panorama of the consequences of his
decision. At the point the decision, he may have looked very foolish to some,
but time bore out the wisdom of his decision. Moses was spiritually
self-sufficient and was responsible for his own actions.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The phrase “considering the reproach of Christ” means
that Moses was in fellowship and considered all the angles. He had <i>epignosis</i>
in the right lobe of his soul and knew the will of God meant much more than all
the glitter in Egypt. Being a believer does not rule out thinking. “For he was
looking” means that when Moses finally made the decision to identify with his
own people, it was with eternity’s values in view. </p>

<p class=Verses>“By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for
he endured, as seeing Him who is unseen.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 11:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 11:27, the phrase “he endured, as seeing Him
who is unseen” refers to the world that Moses could see by faith was more real
to him than the world he could see by rationalism and empiricism.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Greek Verbs “To Do”</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The word “do” comes from three different Greek words. <span
lang=EL>Κατεργα</span>́<span lang=EL>ζομαι</span> (katergazomai) means
something on the inside working itself to the outside.  <span lang=EL>Πρα</span>́<span
lang=EL>σσω</span> (prassō) means to practice something therefore to do it.  <span
lang=EL>Ποιε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (poieō) means “to do” as the only
legitimate translation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All through the Pauline epistles, <i>poieō</i> is used
for the believer committing sin. <i>Prassō</i> is used when an unbeliever
sins. The difference between the two verbs is one of category, not relativity.
When the believer is under the control of their old sin nature, they imitate
the unbeliever. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 7:15, <i>katergazomai</i>, <i>prassō</i>, and <i>poieō</i>
are used.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For what I am doing, I do not understand; for I am not
practicing what I would like to do, but I am doing the very thing I hate.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
7:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 7:16, Romans 7:21 and Galatians 5:17, <i>poieō</i>
is used.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But if I do the very thing I do not want to do, I agree with
the Law, confessing that the Law is good.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 7:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“I find then the principle that evil is present in me, the one
who wants to do good.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 7:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit, and the
Spirit against the flesh; for these are in opposition to one another, so that
you may not do the things that you please.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Galatians 5:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 7:18, <i>katergazomai</i> is used in “the doing
of the good.”</p>

<p class=Verses>“For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my
flesh; for the willing is present in me, but the doing of the good is not.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
7:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 7:19, both <i>prassō</i> and <i>poieō</i> are
used.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the good that I want, I do not do, but I practice the very
evil that I do not want.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 7:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 7:20, both <i>katergazomai</i> and <i>poieō</i>
are used.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But if I am doing the very thing I do not want, I am no longer
the one doing it, but sin which dwells in me.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 7:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Galatians 5:21, <i>prassō</i> is used.</p>

<p class=Verses>“envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these, of
which I forewarn you, just as I have forewarned you, that those who practice
such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Galatians 5:21,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When you make a decision, you should never look back.
Just keep on moving forward. Don’t shift back and forth and muse, “Now did I or
did I not make a right decision?” Moses made the right decision – the divine
viewpoint decision. </p>
