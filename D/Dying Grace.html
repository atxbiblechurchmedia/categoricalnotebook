<h2><a name="_Doubtful_Things"></a><a name="_D-Dying_Grace"></a>Dying Grace</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Christian way of life can be divided into living and
dying. Dying may be a long period or a short period, but for the believer and
the believer only, God provides a time of happiness and peace just prior to
death. Often this great peace and happiness is expressed just prior to the
sudden death of the young or middle aged. This is often said to be a tragedy
because they had been so happy. That happiness and the expression of it is
simply dying grace, which the Lord apparently gives to those believers whom He calls
home instantly.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the case of prolonged death, such as cancer, dying
grace is provided in a different way. During prolonged illness, the believer has
the opportunity to provide a wonderful testimony to those around them. The Lord
helps that believer to have great inner happiness, peace, and blessing in the
midst of pain. There is no fear of death, no concern of death, and no falling
apart in the midst of death. For the believer who dies over a prolonged period
of time, God will provide in such a way that this time of dying is the most
productive and actually the most wonderful part of their lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is a point of ecstatics at the time of dying. If
you are with a believer who dies, you may notice a smile at the moment of
death, or the believer may comment about the room becoming light or utter the
name of the Lord. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Dying grace depends on who and what God is and He
provides it for all believers, regardless of how they have lived. We don’t earn
or deserve dying grace. All believers are saints, not just those who honor Him
in life. This is the grace of God when we die. It is who and what God is, not
who and what we are. Psalm 116:15; 2 Cor. 12:1-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Precious in the sight of the LORD Is the death of His godly
ones.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 116:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Boasting is necessary, though it is not profitable; but I will
go on to visions and revelations of the Lord. I know a man in Christ who
fourteen years ago—whether in the body I do not know, or out of the body I do
not know, God knows—such a man was caught up to the third heaven. And I know
how such a man—whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know, God
knows— was caught up into Paradise and heard inexpressible words, which a man
is not permitted to speak. On behalf of such a man I will boast; but on my own
behalf I will not boast, except in regard to my weaknesses.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2
Corinthians 12:1-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Dying grace removes fear of death and takes the sting out
of death. In Psalms 23:4, “the valley of the shadow of death” is the period of
dying. “I fear no evil” means I will not fear death. 1 Cor 15:55.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
I fear no evil, for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms
23:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;O DEATH, WHERE IS YOUR VICTORY? O DEATH, WHERE IS
YOUR STING?&quot;&quot;  (1 Corinthians 15:55, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Dying grace is provision of deliverance in extreme
difficulty. Job 5:17-21; Psalms 33:19; Psalms 56:13; Psalms 116:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Behold, how happy is the man whom God reproves, So do not
despise the discipline of the Almighty. “For He inflicts pain, and gives
relief; He wounds, and His hands also heal. “From six troubles He will deliver
you, Even in seven evil will not touch you. “In famine He will redeem you from
death, And in war from the power of the sword. “You will be hidden from the
scourge of the tongue, And you will not be afraid of violence when it comes.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Job
5:17-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;To deliver their soul from death And to keep them alive
in famine.&quot;  (Psalms 33:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For You have delivered my soul from death, Indeed my feet
from stumbling, So that I may walk before God In the light of the
living.&quot;  (Psalms 56:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For You have rescued my soul from death, My eyes from
tears, My feet from stumbling.&quot;  (Psalms 116:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Believer in Eternity</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Dying grace is the bridge between life on this earth and
eternity. Dying grace is blessing from God that is better than any other
blessing in life. In eternity, God provides better than the best than can be
found in this life. Heb. 11:13; Rom. 5:12-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;All these died in faith, without receiving the promises,
but having seen them and having welcomed them from a distance, and having
confessed that they were strangers and exiles on the earth.&quot;  (Hebrews
11:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the
world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all
sinned— for until the Law sin was in the world, but sin is not imputed when
there is no law. Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over
those who had not sinned in the likeness of the offense of Adam, who is a type
of Him who was to come. But the free gift is not like the transgression. For if
by the transgression of the one the many died, much more did the grace of God
and the gift by the grace of the one Man, Jesus Christ, abound to the many. The
gift is not like that which came through the one who sinned; for on the one
hand the judgment arose from one transgression resulting in condemnation, but
on the other hand the free gift arose from many transgressions resulting in
justification. For if by the transgression of the one, death reigned through
the one, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of
righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.&quot;  (Romans
5:12-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The is no judgment in eternity. Rom. 8:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in
Christ Jesus.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 8:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The is no sin nature in eternity. 1 Cor. 3:11-16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For no man can lay a foundation other than the one which is
laid, which is Jesus Christ. Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold,
silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, each man’s work will become evident;
for the day will show it because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire
itself will test the quality of each man’s work. If any man’s work which he has
built on it remains, he will receive a reward. If any man’s work is burned up,
he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire. Do
you not know that you are a temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in
you?”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 3:11-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers are immediately face to face with the Lord in
eternity. 2 Cor. 5:6-8.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore, being always of good courage, and knowing that
while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord— for we walk by
faith, not by sight— we are of good courage, I say, and prefer rather to be
absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord.&quot;  (2 Corinthians
5:6-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All sorrow is removed in eternity. Rev. 21:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there
will no longer be any death; there will no longer be any mourning, or crying,
or pain; the first things have passed away.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation 21:4,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every believer has an inheritance in eternity. 1 Peter
1:4-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“to obtain an inheritance which is imperishable and undefiled
and will not fade away, reserved in heaven for you, who are protected by the
power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last
time.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Peter 1:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Death means a new eternal home. John 14:1-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Do not let your heart be troubled; believe in God, believe
also in Me. “In My Father’s house are many dwelling places; if it were not so,
I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you. “If I go and
prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself, that
where I am, there you may be also.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 14:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Death means a fuller realization of eternal life. 2 Cor.
4:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the
things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporal, but the
things which are not seen are eternal.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Corinthians 4:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Dying grace begins appropriately with living where even
God's divine discipline is profitable for the believer because it helps the
believer to mature spiritually. Job 5:17-18; Heb. 12:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Behold, how happy is the man whom God reproves, So do not
despise the discipline of the Almighty. For He inflicts pain, and gives relief;
He wounds, and His hands also heal.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Job 5:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“All discipline for the moment seems not to be joyful, but
sorrowful; yet to those who have been trained by it, afterwards it yields the
peaceful fruit of righteousness.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 12:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God provides deliverance in time of extreme difficulties
of life. Two examples are given in Job 5:19-20 – famine and warfare. </p>

<p class=Verses>““From six troubles He will deliver you, Even in seven evil
will not touch you. “In famine He will redeem you from death, And in war from
the power of the sword.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Job 5:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>No matter how you are maligned, here is a promise of
deliverance. You are the gainer, but they are the loser providing you leave it
to the Lord and do not retaliate. “Destruction” in Job 5:21 refers to death.
When death comes, you will not be afraid because God has provided dying grace. Psalms
64:6-7, Rom. 12:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>““You will be hidden from the scourge of the tongue, And you
will not be afraid of violence when it comes.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Job 5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“They devise injustices, saying, “We are ready with a
well-conceived plot”; For the inward thought and the heart of a man are deep.
But God will shoot at them with an arrow; Suddenly they will be wounded.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms
64:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Never take your own revenge, beloved, but leave room for the
wrath of God, for it is written, “VENGEANCE IS MINE, I WILL REPAY,” says the
Lord.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 12:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Dying grace promises inner peace. Because of dying grace,
the believer can laugh at violence, famine and even death, not humorously, or
hysterically, but the believer can laugh inside because it is wonderful to be
relaxed about death. You can look death in the face and laugh because you know
God provides dying grace. Job 5:21-22.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;You will be hidden from the scourge of the tongue,
And you will not be afraid of violence when it comes. &quot;You will laugh at
violence and famine, And you will not be afraid of wild beasts.&quot;  (Job
5:21-22, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the time Job was written, wild animals roamed the
earth and often killed people. This simply means that you shall not be afraid
of the things on the earth that cause terror or even death. You are not afraid
of certain things in life, such a flying, traffic, etc., where danger is
involved, because you have inner peace and are confident of eternal life with
our Lord.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The dangerous things in life cannot touch you until the
Lord is ready to take you. You can be in the midst of battle, you can be in the
midst of the most terrible and the most extreme situations in life, and you are
absolutely in the Lord’s hands, you are safe. You can laugh at death all around
you simply because you understand dying grace. No matter what the circumstances
may be, the believer can be relaxed about death. If it is sudden, there will be
great happiness just before. If it is prolonged, there will be great happiness
during the interim of the prolonged dying. Job 5:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>““For you will be in league with the stones of the field, And
the beasts of the field will be at peace with you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Job 5:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The body is not permanent. It wears out and is eventually
removed and in its place, for the believer, there will be an everlasting body -
a resurrection body. While dying, you will know that while you are dying, even
though the body is the source of pain and agony in many cases, and even though
you see your own body deteriorating through some sort of disease or injury, you
will have peace. In Job 5:24, “abode” is heaven and “fear no loss” is ultimate
sanctification. </p>

<p class=Verses>““You will know that your tent is secure, For you will visit
your abode and fear no loss.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Job 5:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Job 5:25, dying grace gives comfort to those left
behind. This verse points out to those left behind that their loved ones in the
Lord are under the principle of dying grace and that they are not to grieve as
others who have no hope. Your life must go on. Your life can be destroyed by
bitterness, hysteria, or abnormal grief after the death of a loved one. They
are to go right on living. These are idiomatic phrases, which mean you know
that you have to go on living, that you have a purpose in life and that you
must not allow the death of a loved one to destroy or hinder that purpose.</p>

<p class=Verses>““You will know also that your descendants will be many, And
your offspring as the grass of the earth.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Job 5:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Job 5:26, God takes the believer at the right time.
When you arrive at death, as a believer, your time whether young or old is
full, because this is God’s perfect timing to call you home. The analogy being
used here is corn that when ripened is harvested. All corn does not ripen at
the same time. It is picked as it ripens. This is a promise that when God takes
His own home, that person has lived a full life. </p>

<p class=Verses>““You will come to the grave in full vigor, Like the stacking
of grain in its season.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Job 5:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has a purpose for every life and when God takes a
life, whether the person is just a child a year or two old, a young person in
the teens or in the twenties, He always takes the life at the right time. Do
not question God’s omniscience when He takes a person out at an early age or
even at an old age. When we see some lovely young person taken, there seems to
be no justice in life. We are to understand that when God takes a person home,
He knows via His omniscience exactly the right time. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Precious in the sight of the LORD Is the death of His godly
ones.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 116:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Job 5:27, we are commanded to know what is dying grace.
If you know and apply the doctrine of dying grace, you will be able to laugh at
death. This is the laugh of faith. You look at death through faith. You look at
death through the Word of God.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Behold this; we have investigated it, and so it is. Hear it,
and know for yourself.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Job 5:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Then you are able to say, “O death, where is your sting?
O death, where is your victory?” The sting has been taken out of death and the
grave has been robbed of its victory for the believer who knows dying grace. 1
Cor. 15:55.</p>

<p class=Verses>““O DEATH, WHERE IS YOUR VICTORY? O DEATH, WHERE IS YOUR STING?”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Corinthians 15:55, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer’s spiritual growth is the basis for grace
blessing in life and while dying. This is what is meant in Philippians 1:21.
There is great excitement for the believer in their dying experience.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.&quot; 
(Philippians 1:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Although you will not forget loved ones who have preceded
you in dying grace, even in your sorrow, you must continue in life and fulfill
God's plan, will, and purpose for your life. God’s purpose which keeps us on
this earth must be fulfilled. We have been given the time and grace resources
to do so. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God knew in eternity past the exact moment you would be
born and the exact moment when you will depart from this life. The death of
every believer is always a matter of God's grace. Since God has eternal,
personal love for each of us, it is impossible for God to do anything
incompatible with His perfect love for each one of us. Therefore, we have no
right to question the wisdom or justice of God, when someone we love dies.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Life must go on for the living even following the death
of a loved one. We cannot resent others who seem to be having a good time while
we are mourning for the loss of a loved one. Your comfort in time of sorrow
must come from God’s Word learned and retained in your own soul. Your grief is
a private matter between you and the Lord. You have no right to bitterness,
anger, or abnormal grief. Bible doctrine resident in your soul enables you to
rejoice over those loved ones who are in the presence of the Lord. The enabling
power of the Holy Spirit provides the ability to handle your loneliness,
sorrow, and grief in the proper manner. As with any tough situation in life,
application of Bible doctrine means that you are relying on God’s grace
resources applied to the situation rather than the sin nature’s approach of
bitterness, abnormally long grief, blaming yourself in some way for their
death, or resenting God’s sovereign decision to take them from this life. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the dying phase of God’s plan for our lives, the
emphasis is on the function of the sovereignty and grace of God, because God
decides the time, manner, and place of our death. The challenge to every
believer is always to apply the Bible doctrine we have learned to the problems
and situations in which we find ourselves. Application to the death of a loved
one is simply one of those points of application where we learn that God’s
grace is always sufficient for us to handle the situation – always when we feel
we can’t handle it by ourselves. </p>
