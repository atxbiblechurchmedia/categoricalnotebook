<h2><a name="_Divine_Discipline,_The"></a><a name="_D-Five_Cycles_of"></a><a
name="_Five_Cycles_of"></a>Five Cycles of Discipline</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Five Cycles of Discipline are national judgment for
disobedience to God’s Word. God’s justice must judge nations with punitive
measures against apostasy, reversionism, and evil. Hosea 4:1-6. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Listen to the word of the LORD, O sons of Israel, For the LORD
has a case against the inhabitants of the land, Because there is no
faithfulness or kindness Or knowledge of God in the land. There is swearing,
deception, murder, stealing and adultery. They employ violence, so that
bloodshed follows bloodshed. Therefore the land mourns, And everyone who lives
in it languishes Along with the beasts of the field and the birds of the sky,
And also the fish of the sea disappear. Yet let no one find fault, and let none
offer reproof; For your people are like those who contend with the priest. So
you will stumble by day, And the prophet also will stumble with you by night;
And I will destroy your mother. My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.
Because you have rejected knowledge, I also will reject you from being My
priest. Since you have forgotten the law of your God, I also will forget your
children.” (Hosea 4:1-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As the nation accumulates disobedience and rejects the
Word, the judgment or divine discipline increases. This is illustrated by the
ministries of Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Daniel. The nation of Israel brought
discipline upon themselves through rejection of the Word concerning Divine
Institution #4 - Nationalism. Lev. 26:14-16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“'But if you do not obey Me and do not carry out all these
commandments, if, instead, you reject My statutes, and if your soul abhors My
ordinances so as not to carry out all My commandments, and so break My
covenant, I, in turn, will do this to you: I will appoint over you a sudden
terror, consumption and fever that will waste away the eyes and cause the soul
to pine away; also, you will sow your seed uselessly, for your enemies will eat
it up.” (Leviticus 26:14-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For a nation to survive, there must be morality.
Immorality is evidenced by dishonesty. Two factors necessary to keep a nation
together are salvation and morality. Morality is vitally necessary for the
health of a nation, but will not, in itself, keep a nation from going down. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Five Cycles of Discipline </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The five cycles of discipline are described in Leviticus
26:14-46. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>First Cycle of Discipline - Leviticus 26:14-17</u></p>

<p class=Verses>“‘But if you do not obey Me and do not carry out all these
commandments, if, instead, you reject My statutes, and if your soul abhors My
ordinances so as not to carry out all My commandments, and so break My
covenant, I, in turn, will do this to you: I will appoint over you a sudden
terror, consumption and fever that will waste away the eyes and cause the soul
to pine away; also, you will sow your seed uselessly, for your enemies will eat
it up. ‘I will set My face against you so that you will be struck down before
your enemies; and those who hate you will rule over you, and you will flee when
no one is pursuing you.”  (Leviticus 26:14-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Leviticus 26:16, rulers will be “appointed” who do not
care for the best interests of their people. There will be a loss of health in
the nation. The more emphasis on health, the less health the nation enjoys.
Hospitals will overflow with the sick. Mental disorders will become rampant
with many admitted to hospitals having mental disorders. Note the terms
“consumption and fever that will waste away the eyes and cause the soul to pine
away.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There will be terror, fear and death in combat. There
will be a frantic search for security. There will be a big emphasis on life
insurance, savings, welfare plans, etc. Terror or fear on the part of the
people will cause many laws to be passed for the social betterment of the
people. These laws will trap and suffocate them instead.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There will be a decline in agricultural prosperity or the
national economy. “Sow your seed uselessly” refers to believers not having any
impact upon the spiritual condition of their community. There will be loss of
personal freedoms because believers are not walking in victory because they do
not understand spirituality and are defeated spiritually. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Second Cycle of Discipline - Leviticus 26:18-20</u></p>

<p class=Verses>“‘If also after these things you do not obey Me, then I will
punish you seven times more for your sins. ‘I will also break down your pride
of power; I will also make your sky like iron and your earth like bronze. ‘Your
strength will be spent uselessly, for your land will not yield its produce and
the trees of the land will not yield their fruit.”  (Leviticus 26:18-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the second cycle of divine discipline, there will be
an increase in personal and national divine discipline intensity when compared
to the first cycle. People will be characterized by pride and
self-righteousness. Religion will predominate instead of Christianity. There
will be lots of zeal, but not according to Bible doctrine. There will be
economic recession and depression, disaster and famine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Third Cycle of Discipline - Leviticus 26:21-22</u></p>

<p class=Verses>“‘If then, you act with hostility against Me and are unwilling
to obey Me, I will increase the plague on you seven times according to your
sins. ‘I will let loose among you the beasts of the field, which will bereave
you of your children and destroy your cattle and reduce your number so that
your roads lie deserted.”  (Leviticus 26:21-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the third cycle of divine discipline, the forms of
divine discipline to the nation from the previous discipline cycles will further
intensify. There will be a breakdown of law and order. There will be increased
internal violence. In Leviticus 26:22, the “beasts of the field” refers to
violence in a nation. The Bible must be interpreted in the time in which it is
written. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There will be rebellious teenagers and a significant
increase in crime with little or no respect for authority. Property will be
vandalized. Cities will be made desolate because of mass demonstrations. “Your
roads lie deserted” refers to the severe restrictions of travel that will be
enforced. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Fourth Cycle of Discipline - Leviticus 26:23-26</u></p>

<p class=Verses>“‘And if by these things you are not turned to Me, but act with
hostility against Me, then I will act with hostility against you; and I, even
I, will strike you seven times for your sins. ‘I will also bring upon you a
sword which will execute vengeance for the covenant; and when you gather
together into your cities, I will send pestilence among you, so that you shall
be delivered into enemy hands. ‘When I break your staff of bread, ten women
will bake your bread in one oven, and they will bring back your bread in
rationed amounts, so that you will eat and not be satisfied.”  (Leviticus
26:23-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“I will also bring upon you a sword” refers to not doing
well in military battles. The nation will suffer military defeats. It can be
invasion by the enemy or it can be not winning in some foreign area. “Vengeance
for the covenant” refers to the unconditional covenants of grace to Israel, in
particular the Abrahamic and Palestinic covenants. Israel had forgotten the
grace of God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Gather together into your cities” refers to a nation
that actually lives in its cities like the US presently with huge population
centers that become areas of crime and immorality. The danger signal in the
fourth cycle is economic recession and severe inflation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Pestilence” refers to epidemics of disease,
malnutrition, and physical weakness due to lack of good food. “Delivered into
enemy hands” refers to decisive military defeat with all the horrors that go
with it. “Break your staff of bread” is an idiom for a broken economy with
resultant loss of savings and economic stability. Inflation will be at
dangerous levels. “Ten women will bake”  refers to a surplus of women due to
the number of men killed in battle. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Bring back your bread in rationed amounts” refers to
scarcity of food leading to food rationing. This also refers to one-tenth of
the normal amount of food available. “You will eat and not be satisfied” refers
to a hungry nation. An example of the administration of the fourth cycle of
discipline in history is the ten tribes of the Northern Kingdom of Israel in 2
Kings 17:1-5. </p>

<p class=Verses>“In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah, Hoshea the son of
Elah became king over Israel in Samaria, and reigned nine years. He did evil in
the sight of the LORD, only not as the kings of Israel who were before him.
Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against him, and Hoshea became his servant
and paid him tribute. But the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea, who
had sent messengers to So king of Egypt and had offered no tribute to the king
of Assyria, as he had done year by year; so the king of Assyria shut him up and
bound him in prison. Then the king of Assyria invaded the whole land and went
up to Samaria and besieged it three years.”  (2 Kings 17:1-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Fifth Cycle of Discipline</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Characteristics of the Fifth Cycle of Discipline involve
the destruction of the nation because of widespread rejection of the Word of
God. Lev. 26:27-46; Deut. 28:49-57.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;'Yet if in spite of this you do not obey Me, but act with
hostility against Me, then I will act with wrathful hostility against you, and
I, even I, will punish you seven times for your sins.&quot;  (Leviticus
26:27-28, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;'Further, you will eat the flesh of your sons and the
flesh of your daughters you will eat. 'I then will destroy your high places,
and cut down your incense altars, and heap your remains on the remains of your
idols, for My soul shall abhor you.&quot;  (Leviticus 26:29-30, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;'I will lay waste your cities as well and will make your
sanctuaries desolate, and I will not smell your soothing aromas. 'I will make
the land desolate so that your enemies who settle in it will be appalled over
it.&quot;  (Leviticus 26:31-32, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;'But you will perish among the nations, and your enemies'
land will consume you. 'So those of you who may be left will rot away because
of their iniquity in the lands of your enemies; and also because of the
iniquities of their forefathers they will rot away with them.&quot;  (Leviticus
26:38-39, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;'Yet in spite of this, when they are in the land of their
enemies, I will not reject them, nor will I so abhor them as to destroy them,
breaking My covenant with them; for I am the LORD their God. 'But I will
remember for them the covenant with their ancestors, whom I brought out of the
land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God. I am the
LORD.'&quot; These are the statutes and ordinances and laws which the LORD
established between Himself and the sons of Israel through Moses at Mount Sinai.&quot; 
(Leviticus 26:44-46, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is described in Zechariah 7:4-14 for the nation of
Israel. Other characteristics of the Fifth Cycle of Discipline for Israel
involved rejection of the Sabbatical Year and the Egyptian Alliance that was
formed against God's will. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There was idolatry in Judah. Jer. 17:1-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The sin of Judah is written down with an iron stylus; With a
diamond point it is engraved upon the tablet of their heart And on the horns of
their altars, As they remember their children, So they remember their altars
and their Asherim By green trees on the high hills. O mountain of Mine in the
countryside, I will give over your wealth and all your treasures for booty,
Your high places for sin throughout your borders. And you will, even of
yourself, let go of your inheritance That I gave you; And I will make you serve
your enemies In the land which you do not know; For you have kindled a fire in
My anger Which will burn forever.” (Jeremiah 17:1-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There was dependence on man instead of the Lord. Jer.
17:5-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Thus says the LORD, &quot;Cursed is the man who trusts in
mankind And makes flesh his strength, And whose heart turns away from the LORD.
&quot;For he will be like a bush in the desert And will not see when prosperity
comes, But will live in stony wastes in the wilderness, A land of salt without
inhabitant. &quot;Blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD And whose trust is
the LORD. &quot;For he will be like a tree planted by the water, That extends
its roots by a stream And will not fear when the heat comes; But its leaves will
be green, And it will not be anxious in a year of drought Nor cease to yield
fruit. &quot;The heart is more deceitful than all else And is desperately sick;
Who can understand it?” (Jeremiah 17:5-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There was emotionalism. Jer. 17:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I, the LORD, search the heart, I test the mind, Even to
give to each man according to his ways, According to the results of his deeds.”
(Jeremiah 17:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There was a false scale of values and forsaking the Lord.
Jer. 17:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“O LORD, the hope of Israel, All who forsake You will be put to
shame. Those who turn away on earth will be written down, Because they have
forsaken the fountain of living water, even the LORD.” (Jeremiah 17:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There was cannibalism. Lev. 26:29.</p>

<p class=Verses>“‘Further, you will eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of
your daughters you will eat.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Leviticus 26:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There was horrible and wide-spread death of more than 1.9
million Jews during the complete destruction of Jerusalem by Rome in 70 AD. Lev.
26:30.</p>

<p class=Verses>“'I then will destroy your high places, and cut down your
incense altars, and heap your remains on the remains of your idols, for My soul
shall abhor you.” (Leviticus 26:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There was complete destruction of Jerusalem and of the
temple. Lev. 26:31.</p>

<p class=Verses>“'I will lay waste your cities as well and will make your
sanctuaries desolate, and I will not smell your soothing aromas.” (Leviticus
26:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There was utter desolation of the land of Israel. Lev.
26:32.</p>

<p class=Verses>“'I will make the land desolate so that your enemies who settle
in it will be appalled over it.” (Leviticus 26:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There was and continues to this day dispersion of the
Jews among the Gentile nations. Lev. 26:33.</p>

<p class=Verses>“'You, however, I will scatter among the nations and will draw
out a sword after you, as your land becomes desolate and your cities become
waste.” (Leviticus 26:33, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Israel and the Fifth Cycle of Discipline</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Northern Kingdom underwent the Fifth Cycle of
Discipline in 721 BC by Assyria under Sargon II. This national divine
discipline will last until the Second Advent of Jesus Christ. 2 Kings 17:6; 2
Kings 17:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria captured
Samaria and carried Israel away into exile to Assyria, and settled them in
Halah and Habor, on the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.” (2
Kings 17:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“until the LORD removed Israel from His sight, as He spoke
through all His servants the prophets. So Israel was carried away into exile
from their own land to Assyria until this day.” (2 Kings 17:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Southern Kingdom of Judah underwent the first
administration of the Fifth Cycle of Discipline in 586-516 BC by
Nebuchadnezzar. This Babylonian captivity and slavery lasted for 70 years -
from the fall of Jerusalem to the rebuilding of the temple led by Zerubbabel.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Southern Kingdom of Judah underwent the second
administration of the Fifth Cycle of Discipline from 63 to 70 AD with the
complete destruction of Jerusalem by Rome first by Vespasian and then by his
son Titus. The surviving Jews were scattered throughout the earth – the
Diaspora. This dispersion continues today and will last until the Second Advent
of Jesus Christ.  The temple that will be built at Jerusalem in the Tribulation
is not bonafide.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Fifth Cycle of Discipline in Dispensations</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Age of the Gentiles </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The moral and spiritual breakdown of a nation leads to
national divine discipline. This includes Internationalism with the
construction of the Tower of Babel in Genesis 11:3-4. </p>

<p class=Verses>“They said to one another, &quot;Come, let us make bricks and
burn them thoroughly.&quot; And they used brick for stone, and they used tar
for mortar. They said, &quot;Come, let us build for ourselves a city, and a
tower whose top will reach into heaven, and let us make for ourselves a name,
otherwise we will be scattered abroad over the face of the whole earth.&quot;”
(Genesis 11:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Idealism in defiance of God also leads to national divine
discipline. They conceived a better society, more secure, more compatible, more
idealistic. Volitional defiance of God leads to national divine discipline.
They started at the “grass roots” level. “They said one to another” means they
discussed what they should do and agreed to go this route.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Governmental defiance of God leads to national divine
discipline. These nations united in an effort to organize their society under
agreed principles. Physical defiance of God leads to national divine discipline.
This involved dissatisfaction with the type of human living existing in their
time. The whole ecology bit is anti-nature in reverse. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual defiance of God leads to national divine
discipline. This was complete disregard for God. There was no communication
between God and man. God didn’t seem to be interested in trying to get a
reversal of their opinion and ideals. This was human good vs. divine good.
Personal defiance of God leads to national divine discipline. This is a
structural revolt against God. They refused the divine mandate of going
throughout the world and multiplying.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Age of the Jews </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Age of the Jews, they rejected the Bible doctrine being
communicated. They would not listen and would not obey. Characteristics of a
nation rejecting Bible doctrine and building for the five cycles of divine
discipline can be found in Hosea 4:1-9 and Leviticus 26:14. In Hosea 4:1, “no
faithfulness or kindness” means there was no application of grace.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Listen to the word of the LORD, O sons of Israel, For the LORD
has a case against the inhabitants of the land, Because there is no
faithfulness or kindness Or knowledge of God in the land.” (Hosea 4:1, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“'But if you do not obey Me and do not carry out all these
commandments,” (Leviticus 26:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hosea 4:2, “swearing” refers to false business
practices. In Hosea 4:3, “languishes” means they were in a miserable state. </p>

<p class=Verses>“There is swearing, deception, murder, stealing and adultery.
They employ violence, so that bloodshed follows bloodshed.” (Hosea 4:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore the land mourns, And everyone who lives in it
languishes Along with the beasts of the field and the birds of the sky, And
also the fish of the sea disappear.” (Hosea 4:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hosea 4:7, “The more they multiplied” refers to a
false prosperity. In Hosea 4:9, “like people, like priest” means the people
will follow their religious leaders to destruction.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The more they multiplied, the more they sinned against Me; I
will change their glory into shame.” (Hosea 4:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And it will be, like people, like priest; So I will punish
them for their ways And repay them for their deeds.” (Hosea 4:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They rejected God's statutes and would not obey His
commandments. They refused to obey written revelation. Lev. 26:15; Deut. 28:15;
Deut. 28:58.</p>

<p class=Verses>“if, instead, you reject My statutes, and if your soul abhors
My ordinances so as not to carry out all My commandments, and so break My
covenant,” (Leviticus 26:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But it shall come about, if you do not obey the LORD
your God, to observe to do all His commandments and His statutes with which I
charge you today, that all these curses will come upon you and overtake you:”
(Deuteronomy 28:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;If you are not careful to observe all the words of this
law which are written in this book, to fear this honored and awesome name, the
LORD your God,” (Deuteronomy 28:58, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The reasons for divine discipline to the nation of Israel
can be found in Isaiah 2. In the entire book of Isaiah, Israel had rejected the
authority of God. Drunkenness was evident. Isaiah 28:7-8. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And these also reel with wine and stagger from strong drink:
The priest and the prophet reel with strong drink, They are confused by wine,
they stagger from strong drink; They reel while having visions, They totter
when rendering judgment. For all the tables are full of filthy vomit, without a
single clean place.” (Isaiah 28:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They became religious and worshipped other gods. 1 Kings;
2 Kings 17:7; 2 Kings 22:15-16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now this came about because the sons of Israel had sinned
against the LORD their God, who had brought them up from the land of Egypt from
under the hand of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and they had feared other gods” (2
Kings 17:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“She said to them, &quot;Thus says the LORD God of Israel,
'Tell the man who sent you to me, thus says the LORD, &quot;Behold, I bring
evil on this place and on its inhabitants, even all the words of the book which
the king of Judah has read.” (2 Kings 22:15-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Age of the Church</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The cycles of divine discipline are administered to a
nation because they become a religious nation as well as other factors. Refusal
to preserve and follow the four divine institutions and the laws of divine
establishment brings national decline and divine discipline. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Church Age, Israel will remain under the fifth
cycle of discipline. Rom. 11:7-8; Rom. 11:25; 2 Cor. 3:13-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“What then? What Israel is seeking, it has not obtained, but
those who were chosen obtained it, and the rest were hardened; just as it is
written, &quot;GOD GAVE THEM A SPIRIT OF STUPOR, EYES TO SEE NOT AND EARS TO
HEAR NOT, DOWN TO THIS VERY DAY.&quot;” (Romans 11:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For I do not want you, brethren, to be uninformed of this
mystery—so that you will not be wise in your own estimation—that a partial
hardening has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come
in;” (Romans 11:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and are not like Moses, who used to put a veil over his face
so that the sons of Israel would not look intently at the end of what was
fading away. But their minds were hardened; for until this very day at the
reading of the old covenant the same veil remains unlifted, because it is
removed in Christ.” (2 Corinthians 3:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Age of the Kingdom </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the end of the Millennial Kingdom of Jesus Christ,
Satan will be released and he will unite all unbelievers against Jesus Christ
in the Gog and Magog Revolution. This will be Satan’s last stand with a united
military front against our Lord and His saints. Rev. 20:7-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“When the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released
from his prison, and will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four
corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for the war; the
number of them is like the sand of the seashore. And they came up on the broad
plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city,
and fire came down from heaven and devoured them.” (Revelation 20:7-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God’s National Discipline Expressed</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God expressed His judgment on the Tower of Babel and
Internationalism in Genesis 11. He also expressed His divine discipline in the
conquest of Canaan in Joshua. He brought divine discipline on Egypt in the Exodus.
Gen. 15; Isaiah 20. He brought severe divine discipline on Assyria in 2 Kings
19:35 and 2 Chronicles 32:21. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then it happened that night that the angel of the LORD went
out and struck 185,000 in the camp of the Assyrians; and when men rose early in
the morning, behold, all of them were dead.” (2 Kings 19:35, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the LORD sent an angel who destroyed every mighty warrior,
commander and officer in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned in
shame to his own land. And when he had entered the temple of his god, some of
his own children killed him there with the sword.” (2 Chronicles 32:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He brought divine discipline on Babylon in Daniel 5 and
Daniel 2:35.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the
gold were crushed all at the same time and became like chaff from the summer
threshing floors; and the wind carried them away so that not a trace of them
was found. But the stone that struck the statue became a great mountain and
filled the whole earth.” (Daniel 2:35, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s discipline was meted out to Edom in Obadiah 1:1-9. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;The arrogance of your heart has deceived you, You who
live in the clefts of the rock, In the loftiness of your dwelling place, Who
say in your heart, 'Who will bring me down to earth?' &quot;Though you build
high like the eagle, Though you set your nest among the stars, From there I
will bring you down,&quot; declares the LORD.” (Obadiah 1:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Then your mighty men will be dismayed, O Teman, So that
everyone may be cut off from the mountain of Esau by slaughter.” (Obadiah 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>National discipline is a part of the prophetic plan of
God. Zeph. 3:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Therefore wait for Me,&quot; declares the LORD,
&quot;For the day when I rise up as a witness. Indeed, My decision is to gather
nations, To assemble kingdoms, To pour out on them My indignation, All My
burning anger; For all the earth will be devoured By the fire of My zeal.”
(Zephaniah 3:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Divine Discipline to Cities</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divine discipline is not just related to nations, but
also to cities such as Sodom and Gomorrah in Genesis 18:20, Jericho in Joshua
6, Jerusalem in Luke 21:24 and Jeremiah 5:1, Damascus in Isaiah 17:1, Nineveh in
Nahum 3:5-8, Babylon in Isaiah 13:19-21, Tyre in Ezra 26, Ezra 27, and Isaiah
23:1, Rome in Revelation 17:11 and Revelation 18:1ff, Chorazin and Bethsaida in
Matthew 11:21, and Sidon in Ezra 28:20-22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the LORD said, &quot;The outcry of Sodom and Gomorrah is
indeed great, and their sin is exceedingly grave.” (Genesis 18:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The oracle concerning Damascus. &quot;Behold, Damascus is
about to be removed from being a city And will become a fallen ruin.” (Isaiah
17:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The oracle concerning Tyre. Wail, O ships of Tarshish, For
Tyre is destroyed, without house or harbor; It is reported to them from the
land of Cyprus.” (Isaiah 23:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the
miracles had occurred in Tyre and Sidon which occurred in you, they would have
repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.” (Matthew 11:21, NASB)</p>
