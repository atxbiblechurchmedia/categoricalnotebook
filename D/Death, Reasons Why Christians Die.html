<h2>Death, Reasons Why Christians Die </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>To Glorify the Lord</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 21:19, our Lord told Peter in what manner he
would die as an apostle. In Luke 16:19-31, is the parable of the Rich Man
(unbeliever) and Lazarus (a believer). The believer should be motivated to
reach spiritual maturity to glorify Jesus Christ in their spiritual life.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now this He said, signifying by what kind of death he would
glorify God. And when He had spoken this, He said to him, “Follow Me!”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(John
21:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God’s Plan for You on Earth is Finished</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul is an example of death after God's plan was
completed for his life on earth in 2 Timothy 4:6-7. Also, the corn analogy of
Job in Job 5:25-27. The most striking example is in Luke 23:46 where our Lord
Jesus Christ was on the Cross following the completion of His substitutionary
spiritual death for the sins of mankind when He voluntarily gave up His human
spirit and died physically. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For I am already being poured out as a drink offering,
and the time of my departure has come. I have fought the good fight, I have
finished the course, I have kept the faith;&quot;  (2 Timothy 4:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;You will know also that your descendants will be
many, And your offspring as the grass of the earth. &quot;You will come to the
grave in full vigor, Like the stacking of grain in its season. &quot;Behold
this; we have investigated it, and so it is. Hear it, and know for
yourself.&quot;&quot;  (Job 5:25-27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And Jesus, crying out with a loud voice, said, “Father, INTO
YOUR HANDS I COMMIT MY SPIRIT.” Having said this, He breathed His last.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Luke
23:46, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Maximum Divine Discipline</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The ultimate in divine discipline is called the Sin Unto
Death. Divine discipline can be stopped at any time with the use of confession
of sins biblically. The sin unto death is God removing a believer prematurely
for disciplinary reasons. The sin unto death can also be related to capital
punishment. 1 John 5:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If anyone sees his brother committing a sin not leading to
death, he shall ask and God will for him give life to those who commit sin not
leading to death. There is a sin leading to death; I do not say that he should
make request for this.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 John 5:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>David was under divine discipline when he committed
adultery with Bathsheba. Psalms 38. In Corinth, many believers were partaking in
the Lord’s Supper out of fellowship and died the sin unto death. 1 Cor. 3:17; 1
Cor. 11:27; 1 Cor. 11:30. </p>

<p class=Verses>“If any man destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him,
for the temple of God is holy, and that is what you are.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Corinthians 3:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord
in an unworthy manner, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Corinthians 11:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason many among you are weak and sick, and a number
sleep.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 11:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Suicide</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Suicide is the superimposition of the believer’s will
over God’s will. Remember, Christ died for the sin of suicide. A believer who
commits suicide will be in heaven just as much as any other believer. Saul is
an example of that. 1 Sam. 28:9; 1 Sam. 31:1-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But the woman said to him, &quot;Behold, you know what
Saul has done, how he has cut off those who are mediums and spiritists from the
land. Why are you then laying a snare for my life to bring about my
death?&quot;&quot;  (1 Samuel 28:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now the Philistines were fighting against Israel, and the
men of Israel fled from before the Philistines and fell slain on Mount Gilboa.
The Philistines overtook Saul and his sons; and the Philistines killed Jonathan
and Abinadab and Malchi-shua the sons of Saul. The battle went heavily against
Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was badly wounded by the archers. Then
Saul said to his armor bearer, &quot;Draw your sword and pierce me through with
it, otherwise these uncircumcised will come and pierce me through and make
sport of me.&quot; But his armor bearer would not, for he was greatly afraid.
So Saul took his sword and fell on it. When his armor bearer saw that Saul was
dead, he also fell on his sword and died with him.&quot;  (1 Samuel 31:1-5,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God will not take the believer until His appointed time.
No matter your age, when God determines that your work is finished on earth,
nothing can keep you here. You will be absent from the body and at home
face-to-face with the Lord. 2 Cor. 5:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“we are of good courage, I say, and prefer rather to be absent
from the body and to be at home with the Lord.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Corinthians 5:8,
NASB)</p>
