<h2><a name="_Dispensations,_Means_of"></a>Dispensations, Means of Communication</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Communication in the Age of the Gentiles</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The biblical communication relating to the Age of the
Gentiles involved God speaking directly to man. Gen. 2:16; Gen. 3:9-10; Gen. 6:13.
</p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD God commanded the man, saying, &quot;From any tree of
the garden you may eat freely;” (Genesis 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD God called to the man, and said to him,
&quot;Where are you?&quot; He said, &quot;I heard the sound of You in the
garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid myself.&quot;” (Genesis
3:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then God said to Noah, &quot;The end of all flesh has come
before Me; for the earth is filled with violence because of them; and behold, I
am about to destroy them with the earth.” (Genesis 6:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God spoke to the serpent in the Garden in Genesis 3:14.
There was only one language. Gen. 11:1. Communication was diversified by God as
judgment of the Tower of Babel and the single nation on earth
(Internationalism) as a means of controlling man’s purposes for Himself. Gen.
11:8-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD God said to the serpent, &quot;Because you have done
this, Cursed are you more than all cattle, And more than every beast of the
field; On your belly you will go, And dust you will eat All the days of your
life;” (Genesis 3:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now the whole earth used the same language and the same
words.” (Genesis 11:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So the LORD scattered them abroad from there over the face of
the whole earth; and they stopped building the city. Therefore its name was
called Babel, because there the LORD confused the language of the whole earth;
and from there the LORD scattered them abroad over the face of the whole
earth.” (Genesis 11:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Communication in the Age of the Jews</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Age of the Jews, God chose a nation through which
He would communicate to other nations, that being the progeny of Abraham, the
Hebrew, the Jewish nation. Gen. 12:1-3. God spoke to Abraham in dreams. Gen.
15:12-13. God appeared directly to people. Gen. 17:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now the LORD said to Abram, &quot;Go forth from your country,
And from your relatives And from your father's house, To the land which I will
show you; And I will make you a great nation, And I will bless you, And make
your name great; And so you shall be a blessing; And I will bless those who
bless you, And the one who curses you I will curse. And in you all the families
of the earth will be blessed.&quot;” (Genesis 12:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram;
and behold, terror and great darkness fell upon him. God said to Abram,
&quot;Know for certain that your descendants will be strangers in a land that
is not theirs, where they will be enslaved and oppressed four hundred years.”
(Genesis 15:12-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now when Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to
Abram and said to him, &quot;I am God Almighty; Walk before Me, and be
blameless.” (Genesis 17:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God spoke to people through the appearance of angels.
Gen. 19:1. In the Gospels, He spoke to the shepherds. Luke 2:9-10. God spoke to
Jacob in the form of a man in Genesis 32:26-27. God spoke to evil kings, often
through dreams. Gen. 41:1; Dan. 2:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And an angel of the Lord suddenly stood before them, and the
glory of the Lord shone around them; and they were terribly frightened. But the
angel said to them, &quot;Do not be afraid; for behold, I bring you good news
of great joy which will be for all the people;” (Luke 2:9-10, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“Now the two angels came to Sodom in the evening as Lot was
sitting in the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose to meet them and bowed
down with his face to the ground.” (Genesis 19:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then he said, &quot;Let me go, for the dawn is breaking.&quot;
But he said, &quot;I will not let you go unless you bless me.&quot; So he said
to him, &quot;What is your name?&quot; And he said, &quot;Jacob.&quot;”
(Genesis 32:26-27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now it happened at the end of two full years that Pharaoh had
a dream, and behold, he was standing by the Nile.” (Genesis 41:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar,
Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; and his spirit was troubled and his sleep left him.”
(Daniel 2:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God spoke to certain people through miraculous events. God
spoke to Moses from the burning bush in Exodus 3:2. God had certain designated
communicators for the nation Israel and to other nations such as Moses, Aaron,
Joshua, priests, judges, prophets, kings, two witnesses in the Tribulation,
144,000 evangelists, and angels.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The angel of the LORD appeared to him in a blazing fire from
the midst of a bush; and he looked, and behold, the bush was burning with fire,
yet the bush was not consumed.” (Exodus 3:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God illustrated His messages in the rainbow, the sun and
moon, evening and morning, prophets dressing certain ways, prophets doing odd
things, the Levitical sacrifices demonstrating coming truth, and Urim and Thummim.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God recorded His communication through certain writers
operating under the inspiration of Scripture. Written communication included
the plans for the tabernacle, the Mosaic Law, civil law, religious law, history,
prose, condemnation concepts, exhortation, and prophecy. God preserved that
communication in the Old Testament Canon of Scripture.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Communication in the Church Age</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Communication was given first verbally, received by
direct revelation by the apostles. Gal. 1:12. Communication was recorded by
certain men operating under the inspiration of Scripture. 2 Peter 1:20-21. The
communication of the Word of God in public assembly is made possible by
spiritual gifts of communication such as pastor-teacher, evangelist, apostle,
prophet, etc. Eph. 4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but I
received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ.” (Galatians 1:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture is a
matter of one's own interpretation, for no prophecy was ever made by an act of
human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.” (2 Peter 1:20-21,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The function of spiritual gifts must have as a requisite
the filling of the Holy Spirit for effectiveness. 1 John 1:9. At regeneration,
God has built into every believer a “receiving set,” the human spirit for the
reception of divine truth. 1 Cor. 2:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of
God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because
they are spiritually appraised.” (1 Corinthians 2:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has also designed a grace system by which every
believer, apart from variable capacities, mentally, socially, or
intellectually, can utilize that communicated divine knowledge. That system is
faith. God has designed a capacity for storing divine communication called the right
lobe of the soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Within the exercise of the spiritual gift of
pastor-teacher, God has certain men (all potentially) in the avenue of
communication which best sets forth truth in a way it can be systematized in
the thought process for maximum benefit and memory. This is called the frame of
reference.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God no longer speaks to man in the Age of the Church by
miracles, signs, etc., because He has a completed Canon of Scripture, or a
complete written, accepted revelation of God. 1 Cor. 13.  There is also no
additional spiritual information given by God at any time and under any
circumstances beyond that of the written Word.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In communicating to man in the most exact way, God chose
the Hebrew and Greek language to make clear even the most difficult truth and
restricted those variables which occur more plentifully in other known
languages. Hebrew and Greek are, therefore, an extension of the Doctrine of
Inspiration and relate to the principles of God in communicating in the Church
Age.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the outset of the Age of the Church, before the Canon
was completed, God used special communication gifts which no longer exist. They
included the gift of knowledge which is related to receiving knowledge directly,
the gift of prophecy which is related to truth expressed in predictions, and the
gift of tongues which is communication in another language which the speaker
does not know, preaching the Gospel in foreign tongues.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The chief method of communication expressing the
spiritual gifts of evangelist and pastor-teacher is monologue, the sermon,
one-sided conversation, the lesson, not the dialogue concept of today. There
was the matter of discussion and challenge in Acts when the Gospel was strictly
verbally communicated.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Throughout the Church Age, different kinds of
communication are observed through narrative, lecture or sermon, personal
letters of apostles, and sarcasm, rhetoric, analogy, and all of the
hermeneutical principles. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/H/Hermeneutics.html">Hermeneutics</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Communication in the Millennium (Age of Christ or Kingdom
Age)</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Lord will communicate directly to all people in the
Kingdom. Isaiah 11:2-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The Spirit of the LORD will rest on Him, The spirit of wisdom
and understanding, The spirit of counsel and strength, The spirit of knowledge
and the fear of the LORD. And He will delight in the fear of the LORD, And He
will not judge by what His eyes see, Nor make a decision by what His ears hear;
But with righteousness He will judge the poor, And decide with fairness for the
afflicted of the earth; And He will strike the earth with the rod of His mouth,
And with the breath of His lips He will slay the wicked.” (Isaiah 11:2-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Lord’s communication will be to the entire earth. Isaiah
11:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“They will not hurt or destroy in all My holy mountain, For the
earth will be full of the knowledge of the LORD As the waters cover the sea.”
(Isaiah 11:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believers in the Millennium will communicate the
praises and character of God. Isaiah 12:4-6; Isaiah 25:8-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And in that day you will say, &quot;Give thanks to the LORD,
call on His name. Make known His deeds among the peoples; Make them remember
that His name is exalted.&quot; Praise the LORD in song, for He has done
excellent things; Let this be known throughout the earth. Cry aloud and shout
for joy, O inhabitant of Zion, For great in your midst is the Holy One of
Israel.” (Isaiah 12:4-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He will swallow up death for all time, And the Lord GOD will
wipe tears away from all faces, And He will remove the reproach of His people
from all the earth; For the LORD has spoken. And it will be said in that day,
&quot;Behold, this is our God for whom we have waited that He might save us.
This is the LORD for whom we have waited; Let us rejoice and be glad in His
salvation.&quot;” (Isaiah 25:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Those who have been limited in understanding and
opportunity shall have full knowledge. Isaiah 29:18; Isaiah 29:24; Isaiah
32:3-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“On that day the deaf will hear words of a book, And out of
their gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind will see.” (Isaiah 29:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Those who err in mind will know the truth, And those who
criticize will accept instruction.” (Isaiah 29:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the eyes of those who see will not be blinded, And the
ears of those who hear will listen. The mind of the hasty will discern the
truth, And the tongue of the stammerers will hasten to speak clearly.” (Isaiah
32:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There will be other communicators besides the Lord called
“shepherds.” This is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>רָעָה</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(raah) in the Hebrew
and means the one who feeds. Jer. 3:15; Jer. 23:4; Ezek. 34:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Then I will give you shepherds after My own heart, who
will feed you on knowledge and understanding.” (Jeremiah 3:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I will also raise up shepherds over them and they will
tend them; and they will not be afraid any longer, nor be terrified, nor will
any be missing,&quot; declares the LORD.” (Jeremiah 23:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Then I will set over them one shepherd, My servant
David, and he will feed them; he will feed them himself and be their shepherd.”
(Ezekiel 34:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There will be no need to teach salvation truth to those
entering the Kingdom because they will already have a personal eternal relationship
with the King. Jer. 31:34.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;They will not teach again, each man his neighbor and
each man his brother, saying, 'Know the LORD,' for they will all know Me, from
the least of them to the greatest of them,&quot; declares the LORD, &quot;for I
will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more.&quot;”
(Jeremiah 31:34, NASB)</p>
