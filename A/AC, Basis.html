<h2><a name="_Satan’s_Strategy"></a>Angelic Conflict, Basis for the Angelic
Conflict </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Following Lucifer’s trial and conviction by God’s perfect
justice, Satan objected to God's judgment and in objecting, he impugned the
perfect character of God by asking; “How can a loving God cast His creatures
into the Lake of Fire?” There is no specific Scripture worded in this way, but ­rather
a Scriptural deduction taken from many passages. Satan’s negative volition is
the pattern for man’s negative volition. Isaiah 14:12-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>““How you have fallen from heaven, O star of the morning, son
of the dawn! You have been cut down to the earth, You who have weakened the
nations! “But you said in your heart, ‘I will ascend to heaven; I will raise my
throne above the stars of God, And I will sit on the mount of assembly In the
recesses of the north. ‘I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will
make myself like the Most High.’”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah 14:12-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To resolve the Angelic Conflict, an inferior creature
(man) was created by God on one planet, Earth. Heb. 2:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>““YOU HAVE MADE HIM FOR A LITTLE WHILE LOWER THAN THE ANGELS;
YOU HAVE CROWNED HIM WITH GLORY AND HONOR, AND HAVE APPOINTED HIM OVER THE
WORKS OF YOUR HANDS;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 2:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Man’s volition is being tested under two systems. Before
the Fall, man was innocent and was ignorant of sin. Man had no sin nature, but
was given free will. After the Fall, in sinfulness, mankind gained an old sin
nature, but retained free will. Instead of the Tree of Life to test his
volition, he had a new tree to test volition - the Cross. Man could exercise
positive volition or non-meritorious faith in the future work of Jesus Christ
on the Cross for their sins.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Man’s faith in Jesus Christ as their Savior resolves the
Angelic Conflict. The issue is whether mankind, being inferior to angels by
birth, would choose to accept the work of Christ. If yes, this resolves the
Angelic Conflict. Hebrews 1 and 2.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ took on the form of man through physical
birth (virgin birth). By birth, the humanity of Jesus Christ was lower than the
angels. The humanity of Christ in resurrection body is now higher than the
angels as He sits at the right hand of God the Father. In Christ, we are
positionally at the right hand of God. Therefore, we are positionally higher
than angels. Heb. 1:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But to which of the angels has He ever said, “SIT AT MY RIGHT
HAND, UNTIL I MAKE YOUR ENEMIES A FOOTSTOOL FOR YOUR FEET”?”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews
1:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mankind is under angelic observation. The angels learn
divine judgment of God by watching the human race. Luke 15:7; Luke 15:10; Eph.
3:10; 1 Tim. 5:21; 1 Peter 1:12; 1 Cor. 4:9; 1 Cor. 6:3; 1 Cor. 11:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>““I tell you that in the same way, there will be more joy in
heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who
need no repentance.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Luke 15:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“so that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known
through the church to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly places.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians
3:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves,
but you, in these things which now have been announced to you through those who
preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven—things into
which angels long to look.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Peter 1:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more
matters of this life?”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 6:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Through the fall of man, Satan gained control of this
planet. Faith in Jesus Christ frees man from Satan’s domination. 2 Cor. 4:4;
John 12:31; John 14:30; John 16:11; Eph. 2:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;in whose case the god of this world has blinded the minds
of the unbelieving so that they might not see the light of the gospel of the
glory of Christ, who is the image of God.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 4:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;I will not speak much more with you, for the ruler
of the world is coming, and he has nothing in Me;&quot;  (John 14:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;in which you formerly walked according to the course of
this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that
is now working in the sons of disobedience.&quot;  (Ephesians 2:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The reason we have any information on angels at all is
because man was created as an extension of the Angelic Conflict and to resolve
it. The man, Jesus Christ, is the victor in the Angelic Conflict. He resolved
it by His substitutionary spiritual death on the Cross for the sins of all
mankind. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This left only a single decision to decide where each
human would reside for eternity. Each of us will either decide to accept by
non-meritorious faith the grace salvation gift of Jesus Christ on the Cross and
spend eternity in heaven with Him or to reject that work and remain in
condemnation with the eternal Lake of Fire as the only remaining destination. </p>
