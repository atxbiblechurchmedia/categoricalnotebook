<h2><a name="_D-Angels"></a><a name="_Angels"></a>Angels</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Bible reveals the existence of angels and an Angelic
Conflict that predates human history.  They are a higher creation than mankind
and also have free will just as mankind has. Angels are made of light and so
can be visible or invisible to mankind. Angels are greater in power, ability to
travel, and intellect than mankind. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Although angels were created higher than mankind, Church
Age believers who are in union with their Savior Jesus Christ are positionally
higher than all angels.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Categories of Angels </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Angels are divided into two categories – elect and fallen.
The elect angels are called “chosen” in 1 Timothy 5:21 and “holy” in Mark 8:38.
</p>

<p class=Verses>“I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ
Jesus and of His chosen angels, to maintain these principles without bias,
doing nothing in a spirit of partiality.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Timothy 5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words in this adulterous
and sinful generation, the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when He comes
in the glory of His Father with the holy angels.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Mark 8:38, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fallen angels are led by Satan and are called “deceitful
spirits” in 1 Timothy 4:1 and “demons” in 1 Corinthians 10:20-21. Those fallen
angels who disobeyed God have been imprisoned awaiting final judgment. 2 Peter
2:4; Jude 1:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will
fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and doctrines
of demons,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Timothy 4:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;No, but I say that the things which the Gentiles
sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God; and I do not want you to
become sharers in demons. You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of
demons; you cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of
demons.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 10:20-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast
them into hell and committed them to pits of darkness, reserved for judgment;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2
Peter 2:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And angels who did not keep their own domain, but abandoned
their proper abode, He has kept in eternal bonds under darkness for the
judgment of the great day,&quot;  (Jude 1:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All fallen angels, including Satan, were sentenced by God
to the Lake of Fire prior to the beginning of human history. Matt. 25:41. </p>

<p class=Verses>““Then He will also say to those on His left, ‘Depart from Me,
accursed ones, into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and
his angels;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 25:41, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Organization of Elect Angels </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>People are different in intelligence, race, language,
culture, vocation, and geography. Certain races have always been troublesome,
others contribute to culture, others to welfare. Gen. 9; Gen. 10. This is also
true in the angelic realm. What is true in the human race is also true of
angels. This means that no two angels look alike.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Angels have nationalities, races, and entities. All
angels are not equal. They do not have the same IQ, abilities, talents or even
the same race. Only the Seraphim and Cherubim have wings.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Seraphim</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The seraphim are the highest ranking angels who report
directly to our Lord Jesus Christ and are distinguished from all other angels
as the highest ranking angels because of their six wings. Isaiah 6:2. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Seraphim stood above Him, each having six wings: with two
he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he
flew.&quot;  (Isaiah 6:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This rank was created after the fall of Satan to reward
those elect angels who had advanced spiritually in some way analogous to human
believers’ spiritual growth. They received blessings and rewards that glorified
Jesus Christ to the maximum. Among these rewards were the receipt of wings. The
number of angel wings is a sign of rank – the more wings, the higher the rank.
Seraphim have two roles – to lead heavenly worship thereby glorifying God and
to function as angelic heralds or messengers between God and man.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The two highest ranking seraphim are called archangels
whose names are Michael and Gabriel. Michael is the warring angel. Michael
commands the army of angels who defend Israel. Michael was the only angel who
had the nerve to tackle Satan when it came to a dispute over who would  take
possession of the body of Moses. It was Michael who got to the angelic court
and stopped Satan from getting the kings of Persia to destroy the Jews. Dan.
10:21; Jude 1:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;However, I will tell you what is inscribed in the
writing of truth. Yet there is no one who stands firmly with me against these
forces except Michael your prince.&quot;  (Daniel 10:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But Michael the archangel, when he disputed with the
devil and argued about the body of Moses, did not dare pronounce against him a
railing judgment, but said, &quot;The Lord rebuke you!&quot;&quot;  (Jude 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>During the Tribulation, Michael will lead his army of
elect angels against Satan and his fallen angels in heaven. His objective will
be to protect the believing Jews from Satan and to ultimately remove Satan and
all fallen angels from heaven, which begins the last half of the Tribulation.
Rev. 12:7-9; Dan. 12:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And there was war in heaven, Michael and his angels
waging war with the dragon. The dragon and his angels waged war, and they were
not strong enough, and there was no longer a place found for them in heaven.
And the great dragon was thrown down, the serpent of old who is called the
devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was thrown down to the earth,
and his angels were thrown down with him.&quot;  (Revelation 12:7-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Now at that time Michael, the great prince who
stands guard over the sons of your people, will arise. And there will be a time
of distress such as never occurred since there was a nation until that time;
and at that time your people, everyone who is found written in the book, will
be rescued.&quot;  (Daniel 12:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Gabriel explained to Daniel the meaning of his vision of
the 70 weeks and events of the future Tribulation. Dan. 8:16; Dan. 9:21; Dan.
9:27.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And I heard the voice of a man between the banks of Ulai,
and he called out and said, &quot;Gabriel, give this man an understanding of
the vision.&quot;&quot;  (Daniel 8:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;while I was still speaking in prayer, then the man
Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision previously, came to me in my extreme
weariness about the time of the evening offering.&quot;  (Daniel 9:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;And he will make a firm covenant with the many for
one week, but in the middle of the week he will put a stop to sacrifice and
grain offering; and on the wing of abominations will come one who makes
desolate, even until a complete destruction, one that is decreed, is poured out
on the one who makes desolate.&quot;&quot;  (Daniel 9:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Gabriel was sent to Zechariah to announce the birth of
John the Baptist in Luke 1:18-19.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Zacharias said to the angel, &quot;How will I know this
for certain? For I am an old man and my wife is advanced in years.&quot; The
angel answered and said to him, &quot;I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence
of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good
news.&quot;  (Luke 1:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Gabriel was sent to Mary to announce that she would give
birth to Jesus Christ in Luke 1:26-27.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from
God to a city in Galilee called Nazareth, to a virgin engaged to a man whose
name was Joseph, of the descendants of David; and the virgin's name was
Mary.&quot;  (Luke 1:26-27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Gabriel is the “the archangel” at the Rapture of the
Church in 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a
shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, and the
dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain will be caught
up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we
shall always be with the Lord.&quot;  (1 Thessalonians 4:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are other unnamed seraphim mentioned in the
Scripture. Rev. 14:15; Rev. 19:5; Rev. 19:17. The strong angel of Revelation
5:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And another angel came out of the temple, crying out with
a loud voice to Him who sat on the cloud, &quot;Put in your sickle and reap,
for the hour to reap has come, because the harvest of the earth is
ripe.&quot;&quot;  (Revelation 14:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, and he cried out
with a loud voice, saying to all the birds which fly in midheaven, &quot;Come,
assemble for the great supper of God,&quot;  (Revelation 19:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice,
&quot;Who is worthy to open the book and to break its seals?&quot;&quot; 
(Revelation 5:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The angel with great authority in Revelation 18:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;After these things I saw another angel coming down from
heaven, having great authority, and the earth was illumined with his
glory.&quot;  (Revelation 18:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The angel who will hold the key to the Abyss and will
throw Satan into the Abyss at the Second Advent of Jesus Christ where he will
be held until the end of the Millennium. Rev. 20:1-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding the
key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold of the dragon,
the serpent of old, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand
years; and he threw him into the abyss, and shut it and sealed it over him, so
that he would not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were
completed; after these things he must be released for a short time.&quot; 
(Revelation 20:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The seraphim with the burning coal in his hand of Isaiah
6:6-7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then one of the seraphim flew to me with a burning coal
in his hand, which he had taken from the altar with tongs. He touched my mouth
with it and said, &quot;Behold, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity
is taken away and your sin is forgiven.&quot;&quot;  (Isaiah 6:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The four living creatures full of eyes of Revelation
4:6-8.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and before the throne there was something like a sea of
glass, like crystal; and in the center and around the throne, four living
creatures full of eyes in front and behind. The first creature was like a lion,
and the second creature like a calf, and the third creature had a face like
that of a man, and the fourth creature was like a flying eagle. And the four
living creatures, each one of them having six wings, are full of eyes around
and within; and day and night they do not cease to say, &quot;HOLY, HOLY, HOLY
is THE LORD GOD, THE ALMIGHTY, WHO WAS AND WHO IS AND WHO IS TO
COME.&quot;&quot;  (Revelation 4:6-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The angel with power over fire of Revelation 14:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then another angel, the one who has power over fire, came
out from the altar; and he called with a loud voice to him who had the sharp
sickle, saying, &quot;Put in your sharp sickle and gather the clusters from the
vine of the earth, because her grapes are ripe.&quot;&quot;  (Revelation 14:18,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Cherubim</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Cherubs were the highest creation of angel from God prior
to the fall of angels.  Cherubs have four wings whose function is to guard and
protect. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are the four cherubim in Ezekiel 1 and 10 with one
at every wheel of the chariot of fire, a vehicle of judgment which Jesus Christ
will ride. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are the ruling cherubim angels called the 24 elders
who sit on 24 thrones that surround the throne of our Lord Jesus Christ. Rev.
4:4; Rev. 4:10. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Around the throne were twenty-four thrones; and upon the
thrones I saw twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white garments, and golden
crowns on their heads.&quot;  (Revelation 4:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;the twenty-four elders will fall down before Him who sits
on the throne, and will worship Him who lives forever and ever, and will cast
their crowns before the throne, saying,&quot;  (Revelation 4:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There were two cherubim who guarded the east gate of the
Garden of Eden after Adam and Eve were expelled. Gen. 3:24.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So He drove the man out; and at the east of the garden of
Eden He stationed the cherubim and the flaming sword which turned every
direction to guard the way to the tree of life.&quot;  (Genesis 3:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Lucifer, now fallen Satan is a cherub. Ezek. 28:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;You were the anointed cherub who covers, And I
placed you there. You were on the holy mountain of God; You walked in the midst
of the stones of fire.&quot;  (Ezekiel 28:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Cherubim are the “seven peals of thunder” of Revelation
10:3-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and he cried out with a loud voice, as when a lion roars;
and when he had cried out, the seven peals of thunder uttered their voices.
When the seven peals of thunder had spoken, I was about to write; and I heard a
voice from heaven saying, &quot;Seal up the things which the seven peals of
thunder have spoken and do not write them.&quot;&quot;  (Revelation 10:3-4,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is the cherub who was the messenger of judgment in
2 Samuel 22:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;And He rode on a cherub and flew; And He appeared
on the wings of the wind.&quot;  (2 Samuel 22:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There will be the angel of evangelism in the Tribulation.
Rev. 14:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And I saw another angel flying in midheaven, having an
eternal gospel to preach to those who live on the earth, and to every nation
and tribe and tongue and people;&quot;  (Revelation 14:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There will be the angels of judgment in the second half
of the Tribulation. Rev. 14:17-19.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And another angel came out of the temple which is in
heaven, and he also had a sharp sickle. Then another angel, the one who has
power over fire, came out from the altar; and he called with a loud voice to
him who had the sharp sickle, saying, &quot;Put in your sharp sickle and gather
the clusters from the vine of the earth, because her grapes are ripe.&quot; So
the angel swung his sickle to the earth and gathered the clusters from the vine
of the earth, and threw them into the great wine press of the wrath of
God.&quot;  (Revelation 14:17-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Wingless Elect Angels</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Wingless elect angels make up by far the majority of the
unknown number of elect angels. They function as guardians, messengers of
judgment, and as soldiers.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There were the two angels who warned Lot to leave Sodom
and struck Lot’s would-be attackers with blindness. These angels then destroyed
Sodom and Gomorrah under orders from the Lord. Gen. 19:1-25. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;for we are about to destroy this place, because their
outcry has become so great before the LORD that the LORD has sent us to destroy
it.&quot;&quot;  (Genesis 19:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are the destroying angels of 2 Samuel 24:16 and
Psalms 78:49.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to
destroy it, the LORD relented from the calamity and said to the angel who
destroyed the people, &quot;It is enough! Now relax your hand!&quot; And the
angel of the LORD was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.&quot;  (2
Samuel 24:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He sent upon them His burning anger, Fury and indignation
and trouble, A band of destroying angels.&quot;  (Psalms 78:49, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are the seven trumpet angels of Revelation 8:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared
themselves to sound them.&quot;  (Revelation 8:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are the seven angels with the plagues of Revelation
15:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous,
seven angels who had seven plagues, which are the last, because in them the
wrath of God is finished.&quot;  (Revelation 15:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are the four angels that will restrain the four
winds of the earth in Revelation 7:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners
of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth, so that no wind would
blow on the earth or on the sea or on any tree.&quot;  (Revelation 7:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are guardian angels. Psalms 91:11-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For He will give His angels charge concerning you, To
guard you in all your ways. They will bear you up in their hands, That you do
not strike your foot against a stone.&quot;  (Psalms 91:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are guardian angels for children (Matthew 18:10),
for Church Age believers (Hebrews 1:13-14) and for client nations (Daniel
10:20). </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;See that you do not despise one of these little
ones, for I say to you that their angels in heaven continually see the face of
My Father who is in heaven.&quot;  (Matthew 18:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But to which of the angels has He ever said, &quot;SIT AT
MY RIGHT HAND, UNTIL I MAKE YOUR ENEMIES A FOOTSTOOL FOR YOUR FEET&quot;? Are
they not all ministering spirits, sent out to render service for the sake of
those who will inherit salvation?&quot;  (Hebrews 1:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then he said, &quot;Do you understand why I came to you?
But I shall now return to fight against the prince of Persia; so I am going
forth, and behold, the prince of Greece is about to come.&quot;  (Daniel 10:20,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are the angelic armies in Psalms 148:2 and Luke
2:13-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Praise Him, all His angels; Praise Him, all His
hosts!&quot;  (Psalms 148:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of
the heavenly host praising God and saying, &quot;Glory to God in the highest,
And on earth peace among men with whom He is pleased.&quot;&quot;  (Luke
2:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan has a demon organization, an unseen organization
more powerful than any human power. Satan is, of course, the supreme dictator.
Eph. 2:2. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;in which you formerly walked according to the course of
this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that
is now working in the sons of disobedience.&quot;  (Ephesians 2:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are the fallen angels who were involved in
infiltration of the human race in Genesis 6. These angels were imprisoned in
the Abyss and will not be allowed to communicate with any creature nor to come
out until the Tribulation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are also the operational fallen angels who are free
to function also known as demons. These are the rulers, powers, world forces of
darkness, and spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places. Eph. 6:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against
the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness,
against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians
6:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ephesians 6:12, “rulers” is the plural of <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span
lang=EL>ρχη</span>́ (archē) and means highest ruler, the general officers
under Satan. These are super demons with super power and super responsibility.
The word is used in the Attic, Alexandrian and Koine Greek and is always the
same. How many generals does Satan have in his demon army? This is unknown. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Powers” is the plural of <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span
lang=EL>ξουσι</span>́<span lang=EL>α</span> (exousia) and means authorities or
equivalent to our military commissioned officers. This includes all of the commissioned
officer ranks below the general officers the equivalent of our First and Second
Lieutenant, Captain, Major, and Colonels. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“World forces” is the plural of <span lang=EL>κοσμοκρα</span>́<span
lang=EL>τωρ</span> (kosmokratōr) and refers to world rulers of darkness. This
is the spy system of Satan. This is a special team of demons to discredit and
attack rulers. An example of the spy system of Satan can be found in Daniel
10:13 and is referred to as “the prince of the kingdom of Persia” who is a
strong demon assigned to Persia by Satan. He tangled with Michael the
Archangel. Later, he would be assigned to Greece in Daniel 10:20 as the “prince
of Greece.” These demon officers attack any nation operating under the Divine
Institutions, any important believer like Paul, and anyone in the vicinity of
an important believer like Timothy.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;But the prince of the kingdom of Persia was
withstanding me for twenty-one days; then behold, Michael, one of the chief
princes, came to help me, for I had been left there with the kings of
Persia.&quot;  (Daniel 10:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then he said, &quot;Do you understand why I came to you?
But I shall now return to fight against the prince of Persia; so I am going
forth, and behold, the prince of Greece is about to come.&quot;  (Daniel 10:20,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ephesians 6:12, “spiritual forces of wickedness” is <span
lang=EL>πνευματικο</span>́<span lang=EL>ς</span><span lang=EL> </span><span
lang=EL>πονηρι</span>́<span lang=EL>α</span> (pneumatikos ponēria) and is
referring to spirits of evil in the heavenlies. These are the rank and file
demons who perform numerous evil functions. Some indwell unbelievers to cause
sickness. When Satan calls them out, the unbeliever is miraculously healed so
that many will be confused and deceived. They also push faith healers for the
same purposes. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some control the vocal chords such as the engastrumuthos
demons that speak in tongues. Some manufacture pressure situations against
believers – especially in the Tribulation. They also entice people to do human
good and often to sin. Demons are designed to entice people to sin, although
the old sin nature is basically designed to tempt people to sin.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Conclusions</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Bible does not reveal much detail about elect angels.
What we can conclude from verses in Daniel, Isaiah, Revelation, Zechariah and
Luke is that there are differences in rank among elect angels. This rank
resulted prior to the creation of mankind where each elect angel was given opportunity
to advance in some way consistent with the plan of God for His angelic
creatures and each elect angel was rewarded for that spiritual advancement.
This period of time is called the Prehistoric Angelic Conflict.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In contrast, Satan and his fallen angels were tried by
God for their rejection of the grace and authority of God and sentenced to the
eternal Lake of Fire. Satan appealed that judgment and sentence. Because of
that appeal, God created the human race to resolve the Angelic Conflict.</p>
