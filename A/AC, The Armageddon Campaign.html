Megiddo. The city of Megiddo is located on the southern portion of the Plain of
Esdraelon. In the NASB version of the Bible, it is translated as “Har-Magedon.”</span></p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And they gathered them together to the place which in
Hebrew is called Har-Magedon.&quot;  (Revelation 16:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And he gathered them together into a place called in the
Hebrew tongue Armageddon.&quot;  (Revelation 16:16, KJV)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Tribulation will end with a series of battles called
the Armageddon Campaign. Jesus Christ will demonstrate to angels and mankind
that He will overcome the forces of Satan's entire kingdom of darkness and sin.
Jesus Christ will do this alone. His victory over His enemies will be abrupt
and decisive. Isaiah 63:2-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Why is Your apparel red, And Your garments like the one
who treads in the wine press? &quot;I have trodden the wine trough alone, And
from the peoples there was no man with Me. I also trod them in My anger And
trampled them in My wrath; And their lifeblood is sprinkled on My garments, And
I stained all My raiment.&quot;  (Isaiah 63:2-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Armageddon is not just a series of battles, but a
campaign composed of a series of battles in specific geographical locations. These
battles will conclude in with Jesus Christ decisively delivering the Jewish
remnant. The deliverance of Jerusalem at Armageddon was prophesied in Zechariah
12:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;The LORD also will save the tents of Judah first,
so that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of
Jerusalem will not be magnified above Judah.&quot;  (Zechariah 12:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Demon Activity Preceding the Armageddon Campaign</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan will be behind the activity in the Tribulation. The
background for Armageddon is anti-Semitism or Satan’s hatred for Israel. Rev.
12:17. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So the dragon was enraged with the woman, and went off to
make war with the rest of her children, who keep the commandments of God and
hold to the testimony of Jesus.&quot;  (Revelation 12:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There will be three sources trying to destroy the Jews in
the Tribulation – Satan, the Dictator of the Revived Roman Empire (the
Antichrist), and the Dictator of Palestine (the False Prophet). The two
dictators will be controlled by Satan and will be indwelt by demons. Rev. 13:2;
Rev. 13:11-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his
feet were like those of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. And the
dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority.&quot; 
(Revelation 13:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth; and
he had two horns like a lamb and he spoke as a dragon. He exercises all the
authority of the first beast in his presence. And he makes the earth and those
who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose fatal wound was
healed.&quot;  (Revelation 13:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Demons will be sent out by Satan to the Dictator of the
Revived Roman Empire and to the Dictator of Palestine to gather the rulers of
the world to battle. The responsibility of these demons will be to persuade the
rulers to follow Satanic policies. This gathering of the nations in the land
will become the basis for the destruction of these armies at Armageddon. Rev.
16:13-16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon and out
of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three
unclean spirits like frogs; for they are spirits of demons, performing signs,
which go out to the kings of the whole world, to gather them together for the
war of the great day of God, the Almighty. (&quot;Behold, I am coming like a
thief. Blessed is the one who stays awake and keeps his clothes, so that he
will not walk about naked and men will not see his shame.&quot;) And they
gathered them together to the place which in Hebrew is called
Har-Magedon.&quot;  (Revelation 16:13-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>These demons will enable these dictators to work miracles
and to impress people. The less people think, the more they are impressed by
what they do not understand. Rev. 17:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and adorned
with gold and precious stones and pearls, having in her hand a gold cup full of
abominations and of the unclean things of her immorality,&quot;  (Revelation
17:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Human Activity Preceding the Armageddon Campaign</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Daniel 11:36, “the king” is the Jewish Dictator of
Palestine or the False Prophet. He will speak blasphemy against the “God of
gods” or the Lord Jesus Christ. The “indignation” refers to the Tribulation.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Then the king will do as he pleases, and he will
exalt and magnify himself above every god and will speak monstrous things
against the God of gods; and he will prosper until the indignation is finished,
for that which is decreed will be done.&quot;  (Daniel 11:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Daniel 11:37, “gods of his fathers” refers to Jesus
Christ. Jesus Christ is the founder of the Jewish race. Jesus Christ is the
root and the branch. As the root, He founded the Jewish race. As the branch, He
is the son of David who will deliver them and rule. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“The desire of women” means he will not be influenced by
women. He is not going to play Anthony to someone’s Cleopatra. “Nor will he
show regard for any other god” means that he doesn’t believe in any god,
including the statue in the Holy of Holies. His ego doesn’t allow room for any
other to share his glory. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;He will show no regard for the gods of his fathers
or for the desire of women, nor will he show regard for any other god; for he
will magnify himself above them all.&quot;  (Daniel 11:37, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Daniel 11:38, “he” refers to the Dictator of Palestine
or the False Prophet and the treaty that he makes with Rome in the middle of
the Tribulation. “A god of fortresses” is the Dictator of the Revived Roman
Empire and “a god whom his fathers did not know” refers to the image
(Abomination of Desolation) of the Dictator of the Revived Roman Empire also
known as the Beast.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;But instead he will honor a god of fortresses, a
god whom his fathers did not know; he will honor him with gold, silver, costly
stones and treasures.&quot;  (Daniel 11:38, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Daniel 11:39, “He” refers to the Dictator of Palestine
or the False Prophet and “foreign god” refers to the image of the Beast, the
Abomination of Desolation. The False Prophet’s henchmen help him and will be
greatly rewarded. The Jewish Dictator of Palestine causes the Dictator of the
Revived Roman Empire (the Beast) to be honored and worshipped.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;He will take action against the strongest of
fortresses with the help of a foreign god; he will give great honor to those
who acknowledge him and will cause them to rule over the many, and will parcel
out land for a price.&quot;  (Daniel 11:39, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Locations of The Four Armageddon Battles</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The four geographical locations for the battles that
makeup the Armageddon Campaign are; 1) Jerusalem, 2) Megiddo and the Plain of
Esdraelon, 3) the Jehoshaphat Valley, and 4) Edom.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Four great armies will gather together for battle against
Israel. They are the kings of the East, the king of the North, the king of the South,
and the king of the West. These four power groups hate Israel and will make
every attempt to destroy all who live in Israel.  These four powers are jealous
of the prosperity in Israel in the Tribulation and end up fighting each other
in their attempts to control the area. Rev 16:16; Rev 19:17. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And they gathered them together to the place which in
Hebrew is called Har-Magedon.&quot;  (Revelation 16:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, and he cried out
with a loud voice, saying to all the birds which fly in midheaven, &quot;Come,
assemble for the great supper of God,&quot;  (Revelation 19:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jerusalem is one battle location. Zech. 12:2-11; Zech.
14:2-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Behold, I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that
causes reeling to all the peoples around; and when the siege is against
Jerusalem, it will also be against Judah. &quot;It will come about in that day
that I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples; all who lift it
will be severely injured. And all the nations of the earth will be gathered
against it.&quot;  (Zechariah 12:2-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;In that day there will be great mourning in
Jerusalem, like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the plain of Megiddo.&quot; 
(Zechariah 12:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to
battle, and the city will be captured, the houses plundered, the women ravished
and half of the city exiled, but the rest of the people will not be cut off
from the city. Then the LORD will go forth and fight against those nations, as
when He fights on a day of battle.&quot;  (Zechariah 14:2-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Valley of Megiddo (also called the Plain of Esdraelon
or the Plain of Jezreel) is the second battle location. This is a valley north
of Jerusalem bounded by the Mediterranean on the west and the Sea of Galilee
and the Jordan River on the east. It is about 36 miles long and 15 miles wide. 
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The third location of battle is the Valley of
Jehoshaphat. This area east of Jerusalem is known today as the Valley of
Kidron. It is located between Jerusalem and the Mount of Olives. Joel 3:2; Joel
3:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I will gather all the nations And bring them down to the
valley of Jehoshaphat. Then I will enter into judgment with them there On
behalf of My people and My inheritance, Israel, Whom they have scattered among
the nations; And they have divided up My land.&quot;  (Joel 3:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Let the nations be aroused And come up to the valley of
Jehoshaphat, For there I will sit to judge All the surrounding nations.&quot; 
(Joel 3:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fourth location of battle is Edom. Edom is the area
south of the Dead Sea and north of the Gulf of Aqaba. Isaiah 34:1-6; Isaiah
63:1-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For My sword is satiated in heaven, Behold it shall
descend for judgment upon Edom And upon the people whom I have devoted to
destruction. The sword of the LORD is filled with blood, It is sated with fat,
with the blood of lambs and goats, With the fat of the kidneys of rams. For the
LORD has a sacrifice in Bozrah And a great slaughter in the land of
Edom.&quot;  (Isaiah 34:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;I have trodden the wine trough alone, And from the
peoples there was no man with Me. I also trod them in My anger And trampled
them in My wrath; And their lifeblood is sprinkled on My garments, And I
stained all My raiment. &quot;For the day of vengeance was in My heart, And My
year of redemption has come.&quot;  (Isaiah 63:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The king of the North, the king of the West, the king of
the South, and the kings of the East will all converge upon these areas. Just
as it seems that Israel will be completely destroyed, Jesus Christ will arrive
to deliver the Jewish remnant of believers at His Second Advent. Not only does
Jesus Christ control history, but at the Second Advent, He rectifies the evils
and injustices of history resulting from Satan's rulership of the world since
the fall of Adam. The Armageddon Campaign will be the last war on earth for the
remainder of human history. Micah 4:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He will judge between many peoples And render
decisions for mighty, distant nations. Then they will hammer their swords into
plowshares And their spears into pruning hooks; Nation will not lift up sword
against nation, And never again will they train for war.&quot;  (Micah 4:3,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Sequence of the Armageddon Campaign</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has used invading armies to administer the Fifth
Cycle of Discipline to punish disobedience of Israel and other degenerate
countries throughout human history. God uses the king of the North during the
Tribulation to do this to the unbelieving Jews in Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The king of the North is a great military power generally
from the area of Russia, which will be greater than they have ever been in the
past. The king of the North enters into battles with the other three power
groups on his way to Jerusalem. The king of the North will be used by God to
punish the prolonged negative volition of the people in Israel. He will ravage
the Land and attempt to destroy the Jewish remnant of Israel.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The king of the North will organize two attacks -
penetration toward the heart of Africa and envelopment along the Mediterranean
coast of Africa. His naval fleet will take the water route from the Black Sea
into the Mediterranean and through to Africa. He will engage in one of the
greatest naval battles in human history with the king of the West, who will
defeat him.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The king of the North will have the greatest land army in
the history of the world. His armies will use the land route across eastern
Turkey into Syria and then into Israel. The focus of the king of the North at
this point will be to take the wealth of Egypt and northern Africa. He intends
to then return to Jerusalem to take everything and to kill all of the Jewish
believers that remain alive. He will move as fast as possible and leave behind
only enough troops to keep his supply lines open. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The king of the South attacks Israel simultaneously with
the king of the North’s initial attack. The king of the North will defeat the
king of the South and everything from the Black Sea to Northern Africa. Dan.
11:40.</p>

<p class=Verses>““At the end time the king of the South will collide with him,
and the king of the North will storm against him with chariots, with horsemen
and with many ships; and he will enter countries, overflow them and pass
through.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Daniel 11:40, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Daniel 11:41, the king of the North enters Palestine
after travelling through “many countries” or Turkey and Syria. “These will be
rescued” refers to the Jewish believers who fled in Mid-Tribulation when the
Abomination of Desolation was unveiled. Matt. 24:15-16. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Therefore when you see the ABOMINATION OF
DESOLATION which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy
place (let the reader understand), then those who are in Judea must flee to the
mountains.&quot;  (Matthew 24:15-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;He will also enter the Beautiful Land, and many
countries will fall; but these will be rescued out of his hand: Edom, Moab and
the foremost of the sons of Ammon.&quot;  (Daniel 11:41, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Jewish believers who had fled to the mountains of
Edom, Moab, and Ammon at Mid-Tribulation will continue hiding in their caves
while this huge army passes them by. They will be rescued by Jesus Christ at
His Second Advent. The king of the North will not attempt to conquer the land
of Israel at this point, but will pass through it.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Daniel 11:42, “he” is the king of the North and “other
countries” refers to the route he will use to get to Egypt by way of eastern
Turkey and Syria.  He plans to move south toward Ethiopia and west along the
northern African coastline.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Then he will stretch out his hand against other
countries, and the land of Egypt will not escape.&quot;  (Daniel 11:42, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The king of the North will want to get to Africa as soon
as possible because of the treasures of gold and silver and all the wealth of
Egypt and Africa. Dan. 11:43.</p>

<p class=Verses>““But he will gain control over the hidden treasures of gold
and silver and over all the precious things of Egypt; and Libyans and
Ethiopians will follow at his heels.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Daniel 11:43, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Daniel 11:44, the king of the North has sortied his
fleet for the first time in the Mediterranean. Here, the king of the West
(Revived Roman Empire) will challenge the North fleet, probably near Haifa to
cut off their supply line. Unfortunately, the king of the North will choose for
his naval activities the time of the Fifth Vial Judgment when complete darkness
will cover the Revived Roman Empire. As soon as there is any daylight, the king
of the West’s navy challenges and destroys the king of the North’s fleet in a
great naval battle. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>During this naval defeat, the king of the North will also
hear that the kings of the East have severed his supply lines to the east of
Jerusalem. This combination of bad news infuriates him, so he directs his
armies away from Africa and back to the north toward Israel to destroy the army
of the king of the West, take all of Israel, and destroy all of the Jewish
believers that remain in the mountains and caves and in Jerusalem.  </p>

<p class=Verses>““But rumors from the East and from the North will disturb him,
and he will go forth with great wrath to destroy and annihilate many.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Daniel
11:44, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Daniel 11:44, “rumors from the East” may be either the
Arabs or the kings of the East that are coming into Palestine which could be to
his East at that time. “From the North” refers to the north of where the armies
of the king of the North are located at this time. The Sixth Vial Judgment will
dry up the Euphrates River to prepare the way for the kings of the East (Asian
armies) to move into Palestine (Edom). They, like the other kings, have a good
understanding of what is going on in human history. They will also want to
dominate Palestine and destroy all of the Jewish remnant. Rev. 16:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river, the
Euphrates; and its water was dried up, so that the way would be prepared for
the kings from the east.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation 16:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At about this same time, the king of the West will move
into the Plain of Esdraelon (Megiddo) or Plain of Jezreel located in northern
Israel. His intent will be to stop the king of the North who is coming up from
Africa. He does this as a part of the alliance made with the Dictator of
Palestine (the False Prophet). </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Daniel 11:45, “He” is the king of the North. “Tents of
his royal pavilion” are palatial tents that serve as his command posts.
“Between the seas” refers to the Mediterranean Sea and the Dead Sea. The “Holy
Mountain” refers to Mt. Zion. “He will come to his end” refers to the Second
Advent of Jesus Christ where all of the armies of the four kings will be
destroyed completely by our Lord. Zech. 14:1-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;He will pitch the tents of his royal pavilion
between the seas and the beautiful Holy Mountain; yet he will come to his end,
and no one will help him.&quot;  (Daniel 11:45, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Behold, a day is coming for the LORD when the spoil taken
from you will be divided among you. For I will gather all the nations against
Jerusalem to battle, and the city will be captured, the houses plundered, the
women ravished and half of the city exiled, but the rest of the people will not
be cut off from the city. Then the LORD will go forth and fight against those
nations, as when He fights on a day of battle. In that day His feet will stand
on the Mount of Olives, which is in front of Jerusalem on the east; and the
Mount of Olives will be split in its middle from east to west by a very large
valley, so that half of the mountain will move toward the north and the other
half toward the south.&quot;  (Zechariah 14:1-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This makes three major concentrations of military power; 
1) the Valley of Jehoshaphat near Jerusalem with the king of the South and the
king of the North from Africa, 2) Edom with the kings of the East, and 3) The
Plain of Esdraelon or Valley of Megiddo (Armageddon) with the king of the West.
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Battle For Jerusalem</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The king of the North attacks Jerusalem seeking to
destroy all of the Jewish believers located there. His armies are also seeking
to find and kill the Jewish remnant that fled to the mountains in the middle of
the Tribulation. God will permit Israel's enemies to gather against them. As
the armies of the king of the North sweep through Jerusalem, two-thirds of the
city's population (unbelievers) will capitulate and will be slaughtered. One-third
(believers) will be delivered by Jesus Christ. Zech. 13:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;It will come about in all the land,&quot; Declares
the LORD, &quot;That two parts in it will be cut off and perish; But the third
will be left in it.&quot;  (Zechariah 13:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Plunder, rape, violence, and enslavement often result for
any nation defeated in war, especially when the conquering nation is an evil
nation. This is why the Laws of Divine Establishment mention the military as
the guardian of human freedom. God uses historical disaster to punish believers
with negative volition, in apostasy, reversionism, and degeneracy. There will
be a total loss of freedom in Jerusalem because of the Jewish unbelievers. Zech.
14:2-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to
battle, and the city will be captured, the houses plundered, the women ravished
and half of the city exiled, but the rest of the people will not be cut off
from the city. Then the LORD will go forth and fight against those nations, as
when He fights on a day of battle.&quot;  (Zechariah 14:2-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>These people (unbelievers) who will capitulate will have
been convinced that the king of the North means them no harm through a false
sense of security from false treaties, by sincere promises couched in smooth
words, and by religious phrases. These are people who are ignorant of the Word
of God and will be easily deceived to their own peril. At first, their wealth
will be plundered, but then they will become the victims of cruelty and
brutality of every type. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The remnant of Israel are Jewish believers with Bible
doctrine in their souls. Most will have learned enough of God's promises
contained in the Word of God since the Tribulation began to survive this
disaster of disasters. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The better alternative is to stay with Bible doctrine and
God's grace, which delivers the believer who lives by doctrine. The believers
of the Tribulation will be no exception. A remnant of positive Jewish believers
will be delivered while all this is happening. One-third of the people in
Jerusalem will be believers and will still be resisting. Zech. 13:9.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;And I will bring the third part through the fire,
Refine them as silver is refined, And test them as gold is tested. They will
call on My name, And I will answer them; I will say, 'They are My people,' And
they will say, 'The LORD is my God.'&quot;&quot;  (Zechariah 13:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>After part of the city is raped and plundered, many of
the civilian men will be motivated to fight back. They will understand the
importance of freedom through military victory. There will be military men who
will train a counterattack force. What is left of the regular army will be used
to hold back the enemy while these civilian believers are trained as a
counterattack force. Zech. 14:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to
battle, and the city will be captured, the houses plundered, the women ravished
and half of the city exiled, but the rest of the people will not be cut off
from the city.&quot;  (Zechariah 14:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Second Advent will take both the unbeliever and the
apostate believer by surprise. The suddenness and the power of the Second
Advent will surprise everyone, but not the believers with Bible doctrine in
their souls. Doctrinal believers will be alert and happy. Growing believers
will have the greatest happiness during the time of greatest tribulation. The
mature believer takes refuge in the Lord Jesus Christ in times of peril
regardless of historical circumstances. Psalms 18:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The LORD is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer, My
God, my rock, in whom I take refuge; My shield and the horn of my salvation, my
stronghold.&quot;  (Psalms 18:2, NASB)                </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Tribulation, believers with positive volition will
be alert to prophetical trends. For those believers in the Tribulation, this
spiritual alertness will demand understanding of the prophetic events of the
last half of the Tribulation. Many believers will be rescued by the return of
Jesus Christ from the worst disaster in all of human history.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Zechariah 12:5-6 describes the Jewish remnant of
believers in Jerusalem “the clans of Judah” organizing for battle against the
army of the king of the North. Some of the believers who have military training
take command and organize to fight with the courage and stability in crisis
that only spiritual maturity brings. They will have absolute confidence that
Jesus Christ will return to deliver them. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts,
'A strong support for us are the inhabitants of Jerusalem through the LORD of
hosts, their God.' &quot;In that day I will make the clans of Judah like a
firepot among pieces of wood and a flaming torch among sheaves, so they will
consume on the right hand and on the left all the surrounding peoples, while
the inhabitants of Jerusalem again dwell on their own sites in
Jerusalem.&quot;  (Zechariah 12:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Zechariah 12:7-8 describes those believers who fled to
the mountains in mid-Tribulation and also those who will fight in Jerusalem
during the second half of the Tribulation. Our Lord defends them all and
delivers the remnant in Jerusalem first. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;The LORD also will save the tents of Judah first,
so that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of
Jerusalem will not be magnified above Judah. &quot;In that day the LORD will
defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the one who is feeble among them in
that day will be like David, and the house of David will be like God, like the
angel of the LORD before them.&quot;  (Zechariah 12:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Supernatural Darkness on the Day of the Second Advent</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>While the plight of the believers in Jerusalem and in
Israel will appear to be dire indeed, Jesus Christ will cause a supernatural
darkness to envelop the entire earth to protect the remaining Jewish believers.
Isaiah 60:2; Joel 2:10; Matt. 24:29; Zech. 14:6; Isaiah 13:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;For behold, darkness will cover the earth And deep
darkness the peoples; But the LORD will rise upon you And His glory will appear
upon you.&quot;  (Isaiah 60:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Before them the earth quakes, The heavens tremble, The
sun and the moon grow dark And the stars lose their brightness.&quot;  (Joel
2:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;But immediately after the tribulation of those days
THE SUN WILL BE DARKENED, AND THE MOON WILL NOT GIVE ITS LIGHT, AND THE STARS
WILL FALL from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.&quot; 
(Matthew 24:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;In that day there will be no light; the luminaries will
dwindle.&quot;  (Zechariah 14:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For the stars of heaven and their constellations Will not
flash forth their light; The sun will be dark when it rises And the moon will
not shed its light.&quot;  (Isaiah 13:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This will be an absolute darkness where there will be no
light from the sun, the moon, or the stars. Also, no man-made lighting will be
able to illuminate it. It will be complete darkness. This absolute darkness
will have a profound effect on the armies of the Armageddon Campaign. Zech.
14:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;It will come about in that day that a great panic from
the LORD will fall on them; and they will seize one another's hand, and the
hand of one will be lifted against the hand of another.&quot;  (Zechariah
14:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;There will be signs in sun and moon and stars, and
on the earth dismay among nations, in perplexity at the roaring of the sea and
the waves, men fainting from fear and the expectation of the things which are
coming upon the world; for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.&quot; 
(Luke 21:25-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This complete darkness occurred the first time to hide
Jesus Christ bearing our sins on the Cross. The second time, it will be to
reveal Christ at His Second Advent. Mark 13:24-27; Matt. 24:29-31; Luke
21:25-28; Isaiah 13:9-10 (fire and darkness); Ezekiel 32:7-8 (near and far
fulfillment), Joel 2:10-11; Joel 3:15; Amos 5:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;But in those days, after that tribulation, THE SUN
WILL BE DARKENED AND THE MOON WILL NOT GIVE ITS LIGHT, AND THE STARS WILL BE
FALLING from heaven, and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken.
&quot;Then they will see THE SON OF MAN COMING IN CLOUDS with great power and
glory. &quot;And then He will send forth the angels, and will gather together
His elect from the four winds, from the farthest end of the earth to the farthest
end of heaven.&quot;  (Mark 13:24-27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Behold, the day of the LORD is coming, Cruel, with fury
and burning anger, To make the land a desolation; And He will exterminate its
sinners from it. For the stars of heaven and their constellations Will not
flash forth their light; The sun will be dark when it rises And the moon will
not shed its light.&quot;  (Isaiah 13:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is the light of the world and will lighten
the world at His arrival. Darkness fulfills the principle of “every eye shall
see Him.” Light will be coming in darkness, darkness in which there was no
light at all. Rev. 1:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;BEHOLD, HE IS COMING WITH THE CLOUDS, and every eye will
see Him, even those who pierced Him; and all the tribes of the earth will mourn
over Him. So it is to be. Amen.&quot;  (Revelation 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Return of Jesus Christ </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some believers will have fled into the mountains and some
will be fighting in Jerusalem. When it looks completely hopeless, the Lord
Jesus Christ will return.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is the light of the world and will lighten
the world at His arrival. When our Lord returns, He will be the only source of
light. He will be the only source of light amidst the complete darkness that
has surrounded the earth. All on earth will see Jesus Christ when He returns.
Zech. 14:7’ Rev. 1:7. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For it will be a unique day which is known to the LORD,
neither day nor night, but it will come about that at evening time there will
be light.&quot;  (Zechariah 14:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;BEHOLD, HE IS COMING WITH THE CLOUDS, and every eye will
see Him, even those who pierced Him; and all the tribes of the earth will mourn
over Him. So it is to be. Amen.&quot;  (Revelation 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first place on earth where the Lord Jesus Christ will
stand at His Second Advent is on the Mount of Olives. This was the location
where He ascended into heaven while His disciplines watched. Acts 1:9-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And after He had said these things, He was lifted up
while they were looking on, and a cloud received Him out of their sight. And as
they were gazing intently into the sky while He was going, behold, two men in
white clothing stood beside them. They also said, &quot;Men of Galilee, why do
you stand looking into the sky? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into
heaven, will come in just the same way as you have watched Him go into
heaven.&quot;&quot;  (Acts 1:9-11, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ will do all of the fighting on behalf of
believers in the Armageddon Campaign. This will be very similar to the
deliverance of the Exodus generation at the Red Sea. Exodus 14:13-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But Moses said to the people, &quot;Do not fear! Stand by
and see the salvation of the LORD which He will accomplish for you today; for
the Egyptians whom you have seen today, you will never see them again forever.
&quot;The LORD will fight for you while you keep silent.&quot;&quot;  (Exodus
14:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God's deliverance of both the Jews in history and
believers in the spiritual life has always been by His grace alone. Grace is
always based on who and what He is. Our Lord will split the Mount of Olives in
two from East to West, so the believers who have stayed in Jerusalem to fight
may walk to safety. Zech. 14:3-5. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then the LORD will go forth and fight against those
nations, as when He fights on a day of battle. In that day His feet will stand
on the Mount of Olives, which is in front of Jerusalem on the east; and the
Mount of Olives will be split in its middle from east to west by a very large
valley, so that half of the mountain will move toward the north and the other
half toward the south. You will flee by the valley of My mountains, for the
valley of the mountains will reach to Azel; yes, you will flee just as you fled
before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the LORD, my
God, will come, and all the holy ones with Him!&quot;  (Zechariah 14:3-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is a fault in the Mount of Olives that has been
confirmed by geologists. God’s faithfulness (omnipotence and immutability)
holds the mountain together in one piece. This great earthquake will form a new
canal “valley of the mountains,” making Jerusalem a seaport. Azal is the point
at which the split will reach the Mediterranean. Zech. 14:5; Ezek. 47:1-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then he said to me, &quot;These waters go out toward the
eastern region and go down into the Arabah; then they go toward the sea, being
made to flow into the sea, and the waters of the sea become fresh.&quot; 
(Ezekiel 47:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Today, the Dead Sea is over 1,400 feet below sea level
and the level is decreasing at about 3 feet every year. The living waters that
will flow from Jerusalem to the east and to the west and will cause the Dead
Sea to overflow to the south into the great Desert Valley (wadi el Araba) which
is a natural waterway (a rift valley). Isaiah 35:1-2; Zech. 14:8; Isaiah 43:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The wilderness and the desert will be glad, And the
Arabah will rejoice and blossom; Like the crocus It will blossom profusely And
rejoice with rejoicing and shout of joy. The glory of Lebanon will be given to
it, The majesty of Carmel and Sharon. They will see the glory of the LORD, The
majesty of our God.&quot;  (Isaiah 35:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And in that day living waters will flow out of Jerusalem,
half of them toward the eastern sea and the other half toward the western sea;
it will be in summer as well as in winter.&quot;  (Zechariah 14:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Behold, I will do something new, Now it will spring
forth; Will you not be aware of it? I will even make a roadway in the
wilderness, Rivers in the desert.&quot;  (Isaiah 43:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jerusalem will become an all-weather seaport in the
Millennium. The splitting of the Mount of Olives at the Second Advent plus the
great earthquake causes water to come up from under the earth that will change
Jerusalem into a seaport. Water coming up from under Jerusalem is described in
Ezekiel 47:1 and Joel 3:18. Jerusalem will become the capital of the world.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then he brought me back to the door of the house; and
behold, water was flowing from under the threshold of the house toward the
east, for the house faced east. And the water was flowing down from under, from
the right side of the house, from south of the altar.&quot;  (Ezekiel 47:1,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And in that day The mountains will drip with sweet wine,
And the hills will flow with milk, And all the brooks of Judah will flow with
water; And a spring will go out from the house of the LORD To water the valley
of Shittim.&quot;  (Joel 3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Jewish remnant and other believers who remain alive
when our Lord returns will live on into the Millennial Kingdom of Jesus Christ
in perfect environment. Jesus Christ will rule from Jerusalem which will be the
capital city of the world. Zech. 2:4-5; Rev. 22:1-5; Zech. 14:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and said to him, &quot;Run, speak to that young man,
saying, 'Jerusalem will be inhabited without walls because of the multitude of
men and cattle within it. 'For I,' declares the LORD, 'will be a wall of fire
around her, and I will be the glory in her midst.'&quot;&quot;  (Zechariah
2:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then he showed me a river of the water of life, clear as
crystal, coming from the throne of God and of the Lamb, in the middle of its
street. On either side of the river was the tree of life, bearing twelve kinds
of fruit, yielding its fruit every month; and the leaves of the tree were for
the healing of the nations. There will no longer be any curse; and the throne
of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and His bond-servants will serve Him;
they will see His face, and His name will be on their foreheads. And there will
no longer be any night; and they will not have need of the light of a lamp nor
the light of the sun, because the Lord God will illumine them; and they will
reign forever and ever.&quot;  (Revelation 22:1-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And the LORD will be king over all the earth; in that day
the LORD will be the only one, and His name the only one.&quot;  (Zechariah
14:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Jesus Christ Destroys Israel’s Enemies</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Lord Jesus Christ will come in judgment at His Second
Advent. He will come to destroy the enemies of Israel arrayed against them. He
will end the largest military action in human history – the Armageddon
Campaign. Our Lord does this by slaughtering all who oppose Israel. He will do
this by speaking. Zech. 14:12; Rev. 19:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now this will be the plague with which the LORD will
strike all the peoples who have gone to war against Jerusalem; their flesh will
rot while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will rot in their sockets,
and their tongue will rot in their mouth.&quot;  (Zechariah 14:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;From His mouth comes a sharp sword, so that with it He
may strike down the nations, and He will rule them with a rod of iron; and He
treads the wine press of the fierce wrath of God, the Almighty.&quot; 
(Revelation 19:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Revelation 19:15, “the nations” are the armies of
unbelievers who are destroyed. This is the separation of unbelievers from
believers. Zechariah 12:2-3 also refers to the armies gathered to destroy
Israel and to kill the remaining Jewish believers hiding in the mountains and
those still living in Jerusalem. “A heavy stone” refers to anti-Semitism that
“causes reeling” to all that oppose Israel. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Behold, I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that
causes reeling to all the peoples around; and when the siege is against
Jerusalem, it will also be against Judah. &quot;It will come about in that day
that I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples; all who lift it
will be severely injured. And all the nations of the earth will be gathered
against it.&quot;  (Zechariah 12:2-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Revelation 19:11 refers to the first day of the Second
Advent of Jesus Christ. The white horse is a reference to the white horse
ridden by the victorious king of an army at the time John wrote Revelation.
“Faithful and True” is the title of our Lord because He always keeps His
promises to Israel and to believers throughout human history.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and
He who sat on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges
and wages war.&quot;  (Revelation 19:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Here, our Lord meet the violence of Satan’s evil armies
with His perfectly righteous violence. This is His justice being administered
to those who oppose Him. This is the ultimate example of Jesus Christ
controlling human history according to God the Father’s perfect plan. The only
way to meet the violence of evil is with the violence of His righteous justice.
His judgments are always just and righteous. When our Lord is done, there will
be no more war for 1,000 years. Psalms 19:9; Isaiah 2:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring forever; The
judgments of the LORD are true; they are righteous altogether.&quot;  (Psalms
19:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He will judge between the nations, And will render
decisions for many peoples; And they will hammer their swords into plowshares
and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not lift up sword against
nation, And never again will they learn war.&quot;  (Isaiah 2:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Revelation 19:12 emphasizes the perfect righteousness of
the deity of Jesus Christ and His sinless humanity. All judgment is delegated
by God the Father to the Lord Jesus Christ. John 5:22-23.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;His eyes are a flame of fire, and on His head are many
diadems; and He has a name written on Him which no one knows except
Himself.&quot;  (Revelation 19:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;For not even the Father judges anyone, but He has
given all judgment to the Son, so that all will honor the Son even as they
honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who
sent Him.&quot;  (John 5:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Revelation 19:13-14, “a robe dipped in blood” means
that our Lord will do all of the fighting against the enemies of Israel. In
Revelation 19:14, “the armies which are in heaven” refers to the elect angels
and all of the Old Testament believers, Tribulational martyrs, and Church Age
believers who will have their resurrection bodies. These armies will do no
fighting in the Armageddon Campaign, they will simply watch.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He is clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His name
is called The Word of God.&quot;  (Revelation 19:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And the armies which are in heaven, clothed in fine
linen, white and clean, were following Him on white horses.&quot;  (Revelation
19:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Revelation 19:15, “a sharp sword” refers to our Lord
destroying all of the armies arrayed against Israel by simply speaking. The “wine
press of the fierce wrath of God” refers to the overwhelming slaughter that
ensues that kills all of the soldiers in the four great armies of the kings of
the North, South, East, and West. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;From His mouth comes a sharp sword, so that with it He
may strike down the nations, and He will rule them with a rod of iron; and He
treads the wine press of the fierce wrath of God, the Almighty.&quot; 
(Revelation 19:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Destruction of the king of the North</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The destruction of the army of the king of the north is
found in Joel 2:20, Ezekiel 38:14-23, and Ezekiel 39:2-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;But I will remove the northern army far from you,
And I will drive it into a parched and desolate land, And its vanguard into the
eastern sea, And its rear guard into the western sea. And its stench will arise
and its foul smell will come up, For it has done great things.&quot;&quot; 
(Joel 2:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and I will turn you around, drive you on, take you up
from the remotest parts of the north and bring you against the mountains of
Israel. &quot;I will strike your bow from your left hand and dash down your
arrows from your right hand. &quot;You will fall on the mountains of Israel,
you and all your troops and the peoples who are with you; I will give you as
food to every kind of predatory bird and beast of the field. &quot;You will
fall on the open field; for it is I who have spoken,&quot; declares the Lord
GOD.&quot;  (Ezekiel 39:2-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Destruction of the king of the South</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The destruction of the army of the king of the South is
found in Isaiah 63:1-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Who is this who comes from Edom, With garments of glowing
colors from Bozrah, This One who is majestic in His apparel, Marching in the
greatness of His strength? &quot;It is I who speak in righteousness, mighty to
save.&quot; Why is Your apparel red, And Your garments like the one who treads
in the wine press? &quot;I have trodden the wine trough alone, And from the
peoples there was no man with Me. I also trod them in My anger And trampled
them in My wrath; And their lifeblood is sprinkled on My garments, And I
stained all My raiment. &quot;For the day of vengeance was in My heart, And My
year of redemption has come. &quot;I looked, and there was no one to help, And
I was astonished and there was no one to uphold; So My own arm brought
salvation to Me, And My wrath upheld Me. &quot;I trod down the peoples in My
anger And made them drunk in My wrath, And I poured out their lifeblood on the
earth.&quot;&quot;  (Isaiah 63:1-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Destruction of the king of the West</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The destruction of the army of the king of the West is
found in Revelation 19:19-21.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their
armies assembled to make war against Him who sat on the horse and against His
army. And the beast was seized, and with him the false prophet who performed
the signs in his presence, by which he deceived those who had received the mark
of the beast and those who worshiped his image; these two were thrown alive
into the lake of fire which burns with brimstone. And the rest were killed with
the sword which came from the mouth of Him who sat on the horse, and all the
birds were filled with their flesh.&quot;  (Revelation 19:19-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Destruction of the kings of the East</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The destruction of the army of the kings of the East is
found in Revelation 14:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And the wine press was trodden outside the city, and
blood came out from the wine press, up to the horses' bridles, for a distance
of two hundred miles.&quot;  (Revelation 14:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Revelation 19:16, the Lord Jesus Christ’s rank and
title are “King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.”</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And on His robe and on His thigh He has a name written,
&quot;KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.&quot;&quot;  (Revelation 19:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Revelation 19:17-18, a powerful seraph angel will
invite all of the carrion birds to come and feast on the dead. This is the same
angel of Revelation 5:2 and Revelation 18:1. Matthew 24:27-28 and Joel 3:9-17
also describe this immense scene of destruction.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, and he cried out
with a loud voice, saying to all the birds which fly in midheaven, &quot;Come,
assemble for the great supper of God, so that you may eat the flesh of kings
and the flesh of commanders and the flesh of mighty men and the flesh of horses
and of those who sit on them and the flesh of all men, both free men and
slaves, and small and great.&quot;&quot;  (Revelation 19:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice,
&quot;Who is worthy to open the book and to break its seals?&quot;&quot; 
(Revelation 5:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;After these things I saw another angel coming down from
heaven, having great authority, and the earth was illumined with his
glory.&quot;  (Revelation 18:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;For just as the lightning comes from the east and
flashes even to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be.
&quot;Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will gather.&quot;  (Matthew
24:27-28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The death and destruction will be so great that the
ground these armies occupied will be saturated with blood. It will take seven
months to bury the dead. Rev. 14:19-20; Ezek. 39:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So the angel swung his sickle to the earth and gathered
the clusters from the vine of the earth, and threw them into the great wine
press of the wrath of God. And the wine press was trodden outside the city, and
blood came out from the wine press, up to the horses' bridles, for a distance
of two hundred miles.&quot;  (Revelation 14:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;For seven months the house of Israel will be
burying them in order to cleanse the land.&quot;  (Ezekiel 39:12, NASB)</p>
