<h2>Apostacy</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Characteristics of apostacy include saturation with human
viewpoint, despising authority, blaspheming God, mocking God, lust-centered
mental attitude sins, and trouble makers filled with human viewpoint because
they do not possess the filling of the Holy Spirit. Jude 1:8, Jude 1:18-19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Yet in the same way these men, also by dreaming, defile the
flesh, and reject authority, and revile angelic majesties.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jude
1:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“that they were saying to you, “In the last time there will be
mockers, following after their own ungodly lusts.” These are the ones who cause
divisions, worldly-minded, devoid of the Spirit.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jude 1:18-19,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Categories of apostacy include lust for praise (Cain – an
unbeliever), lust for money (Balaam – a believer), and lust for power (Korah –
a believer). Jude 1:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Woe to them! For they have gone the way of Cain, and for pay
they have rushed headlong into the error of Balaam, and perished in the
rebellion of Korah.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jude 1:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Apostacy can be found in believers, angels, and
unbelievers. Jude 1:5-7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now I desire to remind you, though you know all things once
for all, that the Lord, after saving a people out of the land of Egypt,
subsequently destroyed those who did not believe. And angels who did not keep
their own domain, but abandoned their proper abode, He has kept in eternal
bonds under darkness for the judgment of the great day, just as Sodom and
Gomorrah and the cities around them, since they in the same way as these
indulged in gross immorality and went after strange flesh, are exhibited as an example
in undergoing the punishment of eternal fire.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jude 1:5-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Illustrations describing those in apostacy can be found
from nature. Those in apostacy are called “hidden reefs” and are literally
hidden rocks in shallow water that destroy ships. The apostates sneak into
fellowship dinners to gain acceptance and destroy. Apostates are “Clouds
without water” where water represents the Word. They are unprofitable clouds in
an agricultural environment. They drift a great deal of the time. Jude 1:12-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“These are the men who are hidden reefs in your love feasts
when they feast with you without fear, caring for themselves; clouds without
water, carried along by winds; autumn trees without fruit, doubly dead,
uprooted; wild waves of the sea, casting up their own shame like foam;
wandering stars, for whom the black darkness has been reserved forever.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jude
1:12-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Those in apostacy are like autumn trees which are
expected to yield fruit, but do not. They are “doubly dead” as a result of
their negative volition. They are “uprooted” (passive voice where they receive
the action of the verb) and receive the judgment of God. They are “wild waves”
referring to apostates that destroy themselves by their own power when they
reach the shore and dissipate. They are “wandering stars” that indicate that
they have short ineffective influence. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The judgment of those in apostacy is handled by Jesus
Christ at the Second Advent. In Jude 1:14-15, Jude as a pastor-teacher speaks
about the apostates or false teachers. </p>

<p class=Verses>“It was also about these men that Enoch, in the seventh
generation from Adam, prophesied, saying, “Behold, the Lord came with many
thousands of His holy ones, to execute judgment upon all, and to convict all
the ungodly of all their ungodly deeds which they have done in an ungodly way,
and of all the harsh things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jude
1:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The defense against apostacy can be found in Jude 1:17-21
and comes from the intake and application of the Word of God. They must be
first identified. The believer’s defense is always spiritual growth resulting
in erection of an edification complex in their soul. Prayer is also an
effective defense, but must be based on accumulated Bible doctrine to be
effective. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But you, beloved, ought to remember the words that were spoken
beforehand by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ, that they were saying to
you, “In the last time there will be mockers, following after their own ungodly
lusts.” These are the ones who cause divisions, worldly-minded, devoid of the
Spirit. But you, beloved, building yourselves up on your most holy faith,
praying in the Holy Spirit, keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting
anxiously for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to eternal life.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jude
1:17-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Offense against apostacy includes refuting them and
witnessing to unbelievers in apostacy. But there are qualifications on this.
Jude 1:22-23, 2 John 1:7-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And have mercy on some, who are doubting; save others,
snatching them out of the fire; and on some have mercy with fear, hating even
the garment polluted by the flesh.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jude 1:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do
not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. This is the deceiver and
the antichrist. Watch yourselves, that you do not lose what we have
accomplished, but that you may receive a full reward. Anyone who goes too far
and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God; the one who
abides in the teaching, he has both the Father and the Son. If anyone comes to
you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, and
do not give him a greeting; for the one who gives him a greeting participates
in his evil deeds.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 John 1:7-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are to have compassion (<i>agapao</i> love) for
believers, but do not get into mental attitude sins as a result of pressure
from those in apostacy. You need to understand that separation from them may be
needed. You will not have rapport with them and you should separate yourself
from many of them. We are also to despise the false doctrine from those in
apostacy. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Role Reversal of Men and Women in Times of Apostacy</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The roles of man and woman are often reversed in times of
national apostacy. Man becomes a woman in their soul – a responder. Woman
becomes a man in their soul – the initiator. In the case of malfunction on the
part of a man, the woman must become spiritually self-sustaining as soon as
possible. The stability of a decadent nation is often in its women, not just in
its men. But as the Fifth Cycle of Discipline of the nation approaches, women
without Bible doctrine will also fail in their spiritual life. Judges 4:4;
Isaiah 3:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, was
judging Israel at that time.&quot;  (Judges 4:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;O My people! Their oppressors are children, And women
rule over them. O My people! Those who guide you lead you astray And confuse
the direction of your paths.&quot;  (Isaiah 3:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>γα</span>́<span
lang=EL>πη</span><span lang=EL> </span>(agapē)<i> </i>love of 1 Corinthians
13:4 is developed in the believer’s soul from the intake and application of
Bible doctrine and cannot be quenched by pressure and adversity. This is
unconditional love. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Love is patient, love is kind and is not jealous; love
does not brag and is not arrogant,&quot;  (1 Corinthians 13:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For the spiritually growing believer, the darker the
times, the more sufficient the grace of God. 2 Cor. 12:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He has said to me, &quot;My grace is sufficient for
you, for power is perfected in weakness.&quot; Most gladly, therefore, I will
rather boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in
me.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 12:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>An Illustration of the Man-Woman Role Reversal </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is an illustration of what can happen in times of
national apostacy. This illustration demonstrates the victory of the spiritual
life in times of disaster. No tragedy is too great for the plan of God. Here, a
generation of the people of Israel were negative to Bible doctrine. God had
permitted them to be under the bondage of a Canaanite, Sisera, a general
because of their negative volition. They had spent 20 years in negative
volition leaving just a few spiritually growing or spiritually mature believers
to deliver a nation. Judges 4:1-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then the sons of Israel again did evil in the sight of
the LORD, after Ehud died. And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king
of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor; and the commander of his army was Sisera, who
lived in Harosheth-hagoyim. The sons of Israel cried to the LORD; for he had
nine hundred iron chariots, and he oppressed the sons of Israel severely for
twenty years.&quot;  (Judges 4:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They cried to the Lord, but were not interested in the
Lord. They were not interested in doctrine. They just wanted to get out of
their mess, but if they got out they would forget where they got their help.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>No matter how rough life may get, there will always be
believers who learn Bible doctrine daily, through the grace apparatus for perception
and are building <i>epignosis</i> in the right lobe of their souls resulting in
a growing edification complex of the soul thus wiping out any scar tissue that
resides in the soul. This is what delivers a nation from God's administration
of divine judgment. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Judges 4:1-3, a weak man (Barak) becomes strong
because of the edification complex of the soul of a woman (Deborah). Also, a
strong man (Sisera) becomes weak because of the edification complex of the soul
of a woman (Jael). </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Barak means “flash of lightning.” He was a coward, the
glittering of a sword. As a soldier, he wasn’t much good. He wanted a woman to
go to war with him and provide him Bible doctrine. He was a weak man with a
strong name. He will become positive to Bible doctrine when he gets a chance. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sisera means “attack” and was a general and commander of
the armies of Jabin, king of Canaan. Sisera had been a victorious man, but he
was missing something in his soul. He had never lost a battle in 20 years. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Deborah was a grace lady with a maximum amount of <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine in her soul. This woman had an completed edification complex of
the soul and was a fantastic person. Her husband’s name was Lappidoth which
means “torch.” Judges 4:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, was
judging Israel at that time.&quot;  (Judges 4:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jael was a helpless Arab woman with a man’s name that
meant ibex or wild mountain goat. Her father apparently wanted a boy, but got a
girl. It would be like naming a girl George. She was also a grace lady like
Deborah with a completed edification complex of the soul. Jael and Deborah
would be heroines of the great war. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Israel’s deliverance will come through a woman. One woman
was so positive toward doctrine that she had for years and years been building
an edification structure. This is the first illustration of a person who is
going to deliver the nation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There were no men who has the doctrine to handle the
crisis so God used a woman with doctrine. She had a gift of communication – she
was a prophetess. God had to use women in spiritual leadership because men
weren’t able to do the job. Lappidoth had lost his manhood. He was negative
toward doctrine. A spiritually mature woman can cause some men to be mean. She
was the spiritual leader of the land. This was very difficult for a woman
because she was a responder. However, with Bible doctrine in her soul, she was
quite capable of stepping in to do what had to be done. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Deborah has the Word of the Lord and she gives the
command to Barak to go up and fight Sisera. She says that the Lord will deliver
him into their hands. Deborah believes it. It was a promise directly from God.
Barak had to depend on her stability. Barak had troops, he had heard God's
promise, Deborah had given direction, so what did he lack? Bible doctrine in
his soul. He had no spiritual frame of reference.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;'I will draw out to you Sisera, the commander of Jabin's
army, with his chariots and his many troops to the river Kishon, and I will
give him into your hand.'&quot;&quot;  (Judges 4:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Judges 4:8, Barak demonstrated his pitiful state of
thinking. He had to depend on Deborah for spiritual strength! She was running
the show even though she didn’t want to, but if no man will step up, then the
woman will have to. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then Barak said to her, &quot;If you will go with me,
then I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go.&quot;&quot; 
(Judges 4:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sisera’s army lost the battle with Barak and was the only
one to escape on foot from his army. Judges 4:15-16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The LORD routed Sisera and all his chariots and all his
army with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera alighted from his
chariot and fled away on foot. But Barak pursued the chariots and the army as
far as Harosheth-hagoyim, and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the
sword; not even one was left.&quot;  (Judges 4:15-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Judges 4:18, Jael went out to meet Sisera who had
showed up at place he thought was a friendly hideout.  She said “turn aside, my
master” and “Do not be afraid” to convince him he was in a safe place. When he
heard “do not be afraid,” that should have been a warning. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, &quot;Turn
aside, my master, turn aside to me! Do not be afraid.&quot; And he turned aside
to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug.&quot;  (Judges 4:18,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jael knows Sisera is an enemy and for 20 years has
oppressed Israel and he needs to be put out of the way. This is not murder, but
warfare. Believers in the military should learn to kill well in preparation for
combat. They should be the most proficient at killing the enemy in their
outfit. Jael ends Sisera efficiently.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But Jael, Heber's wife, took a tent peg and seized a
hammer in her hand, and went secretly to him and drove the peg into his temple,
and it went through into the ground; for he was sound asleep and exhausted. So
he died.&quot;  (Judges 4:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Barak and his army then went on to destroy Jabin the king
of Canaan. Two brave women with Bible doctrine in their souls were used by God
to deliver their entire nation from captivity.  Judges 4:23-24.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan
before the sons of Israel. The hand of the sons of Israel pressed heavier and
heavier upon Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin the king
of Canaan.&quot;  (Judges 4:23-24, NASB)</p>
