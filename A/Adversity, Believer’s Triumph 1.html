<h2><a name="_D-Maximum_Adversity,_The"></a>Maximum Adversity, Believer’s Triumph
– Part 1</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Introduction</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is a study of what happens to young people during
and after an invasion, in the destruction of cities, and how Bible doctrine
makes the difference. It is based on the death march from Ramah to Babylon
after the complete destruction of Jerusalem in August of 586 BC by the army of
King Nebuchadnezzar.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The author of Psalm 119 is Ezra’s father who suffered the
horrors of that death march as a young teenager and related those experiences
to Ezra who wrote them down. Ezra’s father saw his family decapitated and was
forced to march from Ramah to Babylon suffering horrible abuse. Psalm 119 could
be retitled as, “The Believer’s Triumph in Maximum Adversity.” It describes the
horrors of the Fifth Cycle of Discipline and the death march from Ramah to
Babylon. It also describes how the Lord sustained him under the most extreme of
circumstances.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ezra’s father survived the death march because he had
Bible doctrine in the right lobe of his soul. Are you made of that kind of
stuff? Never without Bible doctrine. Ezra’s father related his experiences about
Ramah to his son Ezra, his march in chains, the drunken and cruel Babylonian
soldiers who came back for the girls, other soldiers for the boys. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We should all know with certainty that God has a plan for
the worst disaster that could ever come our way. They were still alive and God
had a purpose for their lives. Jer. 15:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Your words were found and I ate them, And Your words became
for me a joy and the delight of my heart; For I have been called by Your name,
O LORD God of hosts.”  (Jeremiah 15:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Even with this, God had the solution for those that
remained with horrific problems. Problems that you and I have will never have
to face. Even though you go through the most horrible things and still survive,
God has a purpose for your life. This may sound brutal, but it is true. If you
think such horrors only happened in the distant past, think again.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Remember the Mongol hordes of Genghis Khan in the 13<sup>th</sup>
and 14<sup>th</sup> centuries whose armies would find a city and leave a pile
of skulls in their wake. History indicates that millions were massacred as they
went from city to city. Remember the Japanese Rape of Nanking in 1937 where Japanese
troops butchered more than 200,000 male civilians and raped at least 20,000
women and girls, many of whom were mutilated or killed in the process. Remember
the Russians at Katyn in1939, during the Russian invasion of Poland, some
14,500 Polish officers were massacred and buried in eight mass graves. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>After the destruction of Jerusalem, all the babies,
children, and young people were marched to Ramah. At Ramah was the first great
shock of the people after the fall of Jerusalem. All babes in arms and children
under 10 years old were killed brutally. Those over 10 years old were abused,
tortured, continually raped and taken as slaves. Jer. 31:15; Matt. 2:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Thus says the LORD, “A voice is heard in Ramah, Lamentation
and bitter weeping. Rachel is weeping for her children; She refuses to be
comforted for her children, Because they are no more.”“  (Jeremiah 31:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““A VOICE WAS HEARD IN RAMAH, WEEPING AND GREAT MOURNING,
RACHEL WEEPING FOR HER CHILDREN; AND SHE REFUSED TO BE COMFORTED, BECAUSE THEY
WERE NO MORE.”“  (Matthew 2:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When the mothers screamed, they were slaughtered or
tortured. History is filled with brutal armies like this. It was the policy of
all ancient armies to leave the children behind. If the children over 10 couldn’t
keep up, they were clubbed or speared.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mothers were told to stop their crying even though they
had faced the worst that any woman can face. In addition to that, the teenagers
were suffering from the shock of their younger brothers and sisters being
killed and/or abused. Most of the children (ages 10-13) lived and suffered at
the hands of the soldiers. Most of the men had been killed. All men over 35
years old were killed. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The structure of Psalm 119 is based on 22 letters in the
Hebrew alphabet and is an acrostic Psalm with eight verses in each file. Ezra’s
father lived through the death march and lived to see the triumph of Bible
doctrine in his life. He taught his son well for Ezra became the great man of
the Lord in his day. Ezra 7:10; Hebrews 8. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For Ezra had set his heart to study the law of the LORD and to
practice it, and to teach His statutes and ordinances in Israel.”  (Ezra 7:10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Aleph File - Prosperity Under Pressure</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Aleph in the Hebrew language means Ox and is not an “a”
but is a guttural. There are no vowels in the Hebrew language – all letters are
consonants. In Psalms 119:1, “blessed” is the plural of <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>אשׁר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span>
(‘esher) and means happinesses. “Those whose way is blameless” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>תּמים</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> (tâmı̂ym) and refers to those with an edification complex of
the soul who are equipped for anything. They are equipped for disaster, for
tragedy, for heartache, for success, and for changing circumstances. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Aleph. How blessed are those whose way is blameless, Who walk
in the law of the LORD.”  (Psalms 119:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:2, “observe” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>נצר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span>
(nâtsar) and means to guard, to protect, to cultivate soil. This means to
convert Bible doctrine from <i>gnosis</i> to <i>epignosis</i> in the soul. The
qal active participle shows continuous action in present time.  “Testimonies”
is Bible doctrine pertaining to the God-head, the essence of God, the Person of
God, and the plan of God. “Seek” is positive volition towards doctrine.</p>

<p class=Verses>“How blessed are those who observe His testimonies, Who seek
Him with all their heart.”  (Psalms 119:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There never has been in the history of the human race, a
problem, an adversity, a disaster, a frustration, a heartache too difficult for
the plan of God. Ezra’s father went through the fifth cycle of discipline, saw
his family killed, was a slave, walked back to Babylon and came out of these
things in a marvelous way. Sooner or later you are going to find a problem too
big for you to handle and you will have to trust God and the content of His
Word. “All their heart” refers to the essence of the right lobe of the soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Psalms 119:3 says that even though they have old sin
natures, they do not produce human good or sin because they were filled with
the Holy Spirit. Anything you do must be done in the filling of the Spirit.
“They walk in His ways” is using the grace apparatus for perception to learn
Bible doctrine with resultant application of Bible doctrine from the right lobe
of the soul. This is the spiritual life.</p>

<p class=Verses>“They also do no unrighteousness; They walk in His ways.” 
(Psalms 119:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:4, “You have ordained” means to decree, to
appoint. It is the piel perfect of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>צוה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (tsâvâh).
The piel stem is very intensive. The perfect tense means God decreed in
eternity past, that all our problems, heartaches, disasters, were known by Him.
We are to keep spiritual precepts diligently. “Precepts” are Bible doctrine
treated categorically.  “Should keep” means to guard, to protect, to utilize.
Isaiah 28:10; Isaiah 28:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“You have ordained Your precepts, That we should keep them
diligently.”  (Psalms 119:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““For He says, ‘Order on order, order on order, Line on line,
line on line, A little here, a little there.’““  (Isaiah 28:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So the word of the LORD to them will be, “Order on order,
order on order, Line on line, line on line, A little here, a little there,”
That they may go and stumble backward, be broken, snared and taken captive.” 
(Isaiah 28:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Psalms 119:5 states the desire of Ezra’s father as he
begins the death march. He is in shackles as a slave and will be tortured,
abused and maltreated in many ways. “My ways” is the operation of the Holy
Spirit in the human spirit to transfer spiritual phenomena to the left lobe of
the soul as <i>gnosis</i> and if believed, to transfer the believed Bible
doctrine to the right lobe of the soul as <i>epignosis</i>. “Be established”
refers to the cycling of Bible doctrine in the soul. “To keep Your statutes”
refers to Bible doctrine categorically stored in the right lobe in the
edification complex ready to apply to life’s situations.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“Oh that my ways may be established To keep Your statutes!” 
(Psalms 119:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:6, “ashamed” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>בּוּשׁ</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> (bûsh) and means to not be confused. The antonym is
confidence. They know right from wrong. Their norms and standards are correct.
They know where they stand at all times. They use confession of sin, if out of
line. “When I look upon” means to look on something with pleasure, with
positive volition. You want it immediately. Matt. 4:4; Jer. 15:16; Job 23:12. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then I shall not be ashamed When I look upon all Your
commandments.”  (Psalms 119:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But He answered and said, “It is written, ‘MAN SHALL NOT LIVE
ON BREAD ALONE, BUT ON EVERY WORD THAT PROCEEDS OUT OF THE MOUTH OF GOD.’“ “ 
(Matthew 4:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Your words were found and I ate them, And Your words became
for me a joy and the delight of my heart; For I have been called by Your name,
O LORD God of hosts.”  (Jeremiah 15:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““I have not departed from the command of His lips; I have
treasured the words of His mouth more than my necessary food.”  (Job 23:12,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:7, “uprightness of heart” is the proper
frame of reference in the norms and standards in the right lobe of the soul.
“When I learn” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>למד</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (lâmad) and means to learn the hard way
with knots on your head. “Your righteous judgments” means there is much to
learn and some will be learned the hard way. Prosperity depends upon knowledge
of Bible doctrine - <i>gnosis</i> converted to <i>epignosis</i> by God the Holy
Spirit and transferred to the right lobe of the soul.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I shall give thanks to You with uprightness of heart, When I
learn Your righteous judgments.”  (Psalms 119:7, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:8, “statutes” is Bible doctrine learned
categorically and in the right lobe of the soul.  Ezra’s father wanted the Lord
to keep him alive long enough to get a completed edification complex or
spiritual maturity. He wanted to live long enough to see God’s grace in action
under maximum adversity.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I shall keep Your statutes; Do not forsake me utterly!” 
(Psalms 119:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Beth File – The Plan of God</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew letter Beth means house and refers to the plan
of God in salvation, the Christian way of life, and in eternity. This is the
second day of the march. He was a slave, an animal, a nothing. He would be
abused and tortured by the Chaldean guards. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Psalms 119:9 presents the confession of sin challenge. How
can a teenager keep himself pure? Most teenagers aren’t concerned about this
today. The attitude is “What is the crowd doing and how far can I go and not
get caught?” </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Beth. How can a young man keep his way pure? By keeping
it according to Your word.&quot;  (Psalms 119:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The answer is; “by keeping it according to Your Word.” 
It is the Word of God guarding the soul, guarding the mind, guarding the
emotions, guarding the conscience, and so on. By doing so while under pressure,
he doesn’t crack. He knew how to handle it. He was keeping short accounts with
God and staying in followship a maximum amount of the time. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Psalms 119:10-11 involves inner stability. “With all my
heart” refers to the inner spiritual life, the way the Word of God is taken in.
When does a teenager need to get the Word? Now. “I have sought You” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>דּרשׁ</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(dârash) in the perfect tense and refers
to the time he spent in the Word before this happened. He had evidently gotten
away from the Word for a while.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;With all my heart I have sought You; Do not let me wander
from Your commandments. Your word I have treasured in my heart, That I may not
sin against You.&quot;  (Psalms 119:10-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To “wander” is the hiphil imperfect of <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שׁגה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(shâgâh) and means to be caused to
stray, to get out of fellowship under abnormal circumstances. “Commandments”
refers to Bible doctrine obeyed and applied in the spiritual life. “Your Word I
have treasured” is the qal perfect and refers to events in the past. He can’t
study now. He is dependent upon what he has already learned.  “Your Word have I
treasured in my heart.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As a teenager, he regarded the Word more valuable than
anything in the world. He thought it was more important than dating. He thought
it was more important than going down to the local poolhall with the boys. He
thought it was more important than sitting around all night and listening to
some live band or looking at the latest thing on TV. He thought it was more
important than eating. It was the thing that counted.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is a lot more than giving lip service. What is
important to you? Pleasure, social life, TV, surfing, hunting, fishing? All of
his details of life were taken away. Where is your treasure? Is it Bible
doctrine? “That I may not sin” means to make a false step, to downgrade Bible
doctrine. This would be throwing his treasure away and treading the Word of God
underfoot. Matt. 5:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Whoever then annuls one of the least of these
commandments, and teaches others to do the same, shall be called least in the
kingdom of heaven; but whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great
in the kingdom of heaven.&quot;  (Matthew 5:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:12, we have the praise factor. “Blessed are
You” describes the character of God from the standpoint of one who knows
doctrine. “Teach me” is the piel imperfect of <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>למד</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(lâmad) and means to diligently teach. This is a short,
intensive prayer. “I need more Bible doctrine.” “Statutes” refers to <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the soul ready to be applied.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Blessed are You, O LORD; Teach me Your statutes.&quot; 
(Psalms 119:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:13, we have the mechanics of confession.
“With my lips” is an idiom for confession. “I have told” means to enumerate
sins that have been judged already. “All the ordinances of Your mouth”
recognizes that Bible doctrine gives God’s judicial verdict concerning sin.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;With my lips I have told of All the ordinances of Your
mouth.&quot;  (Psalms 119:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Psalms 119:14-16 presents the result of being in
fellowship. “I have rejoiced (inner happiness) in the way of Your testimonies
(Bible doctrine pertaining to the Godhead), as much as in all riches (he
treasures God’s Word).” It is easier to be filled with self-pity, mental
attitude sins, and with whining. “Why did God let this happen to me?” “I will
meditate on Your precepts” refers to the origin and preservation of the Word
and thus the preservation of God’s Word for the believer. He is saying that it
is marvelous that he has Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I have rejoiced in the way of Your testimonies, As much
as in all riches. I will meditate on Your precepts And regard Your ways. I
shall delight in Your statutes; I shall not forget Your word.&quot;  (Psalms
119:14-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“And regard Your ways” means to anticipate with extreme
pleasure God’s ways. One of God’s ways is Bible class. He keeps pulling Bible
doctrine out of his soul’s frame of reference. “I shall delight in Your
statutes” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שָׁעַע</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(shaa) and means to
take delight in and means he is passionate about the <i>epignosis</i> Bible
doctrine categorized in the right lobe of his soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“I shall not forget Your word” means the battle is in the
soul and his soul is intact. He is occupied with Christ. His treasure is Bible
doctrine. He delights in Bible doctrine. He anticipates Bible doctrine. He
loves to learn and apply Bible doctrine every day. There is the answer. I will
not forget or neglect Your Word.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Gimel File – The Wisdom of God’s Word</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew letter Gimel means camel, beast of burden,
well-traveled. Psalms 119:17 indicates that the believer must have an extensive
knowledge and wisdom of God’s Word in their soul.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Gimel. Deal bountifully with Your servant, That I may
live and keep Your word.&quot;  (Psalms 119:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Deal bountifully” is the qal imperative of <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>גּמל</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(gâmal) and means to benefit me, to be
benefitted by the plan of God. This avoids the trap where any detail of life
gains a higher priority over the intake of Bible doctrine. These details of
life include money, success, pleasure, social life, loved ones, friends,
health, sex, materialistic things, and status symbols. This also avoids the
trap where a person goes negative and will not avail themselves of Bible
doctrine. The third trap avoided is the mental attitude sin trap of jealousy,
pride, bitterness, hostility, revenge, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Your servant” refers to the believer. “That I may live”
means living in the Word, using the grace apparatus for perception for learning
Bible doctrine. “And keep Your Word” is an idiom for using the Word all the
time. We are to keep it in the right lobe of our souls, ready for use at all
times.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:18, “Open my eyes” is the piel imperative
of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>גּלה</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(gâlâh) and means
to remove the scar tissue from my soul. “That I may behold” is the hiphil
causative of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>נבט</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(nâbaṭ) and means
to  cause to look with pleasure upon something.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Open my eyes, that I may behold Wonderful things from
Your law.&quot;  (Psalms 119:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:19, “I am a stranger in the earth” is a
Hebrew idiom that means he is in slavery now as a foreigner. “Do not hide Your
commandments from me” means don’t let me get away from Bible doctrine. It’s my
only chance to glorify the Lord.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I am a stranger in the earth; Do not hide Your
commandments from me.&quot;  (Psalms 119:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:20, “My soul is crushed with longing” means
my soul is bruised with desire. “After Your ordinances” means he longs for
Bible doctrine. He is hungry for Bible doctrine. “At all times” means this is
the constant desire of his soul.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;My soul is crushed with longing After Your ordinances at
all times.&quot;  (Psalms 119:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:21, “You rebuke the arrogant” refers to
religion using human viewpoint to produce human good to attempt to gain a
relationship with God. “The cursed” refers to the fifth cycle of discipline. “Who
wander from Your commandments” are those that feel proud because they got away
from the Word of God.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;You rebuke the arrogant, the cursed, Who wander from Your
commandments.&quot;  (Psalms 119:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:22, “Take away reproach and contempt from
me” means to take away the disgrace that belongs to the fifth cycle of
discipline by casting all cares upon the Lord. “For I observe Your testimonies”
means you know whether or not you are in fellowship and whether or not you are
pleasing the Lord. This is a statement of fact, not of boasting.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Take away reproach and contempt from me, For I observe
Your testimonies.&quot;  (Psalms 119:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:23, “princes sit and talk against me”
refers to the pressure from men in high authority. His father was the high
priest. “Your servant meditates on Your statutes” means he had divine viewpoint
by applying Bible doctrine under pressure.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Even though princes sit and talk against me, Your servant
meditates on Your statutes.&quot;  (Psalms 119:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:24, “Your testimonies also are my delight”
means he was passionate about God's Word. “My counselors” means that the Word
of God counseled him.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Your testimonies also are my delight; They are my
counselors.&quot;  (Psalms 119:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Daleth File – The Entrance Into the Plan of God</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew letter Daleth represents a door or entrance
and refers to entrance into the plan of God. God can take care of all my
problems. Doctrine is greater than any disaster, any catastrophe, or any
heartache.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:25, “My soul cleaves” is the qal perfect of
<span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>דּבק</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(dâbaq) and  means
to be glued to something, to adhere. What has happened since he has been taken
a slave? “To the dust” means my soul is glued to the dust. This is used three
ways in Scripture. With reference to the human body in Genesis 3:19, with
reference to resurrection in Daniel 12:9, and with reference to pressure or
disaster. He is saying, “I am under maximum suffering conditions.” There is
physical suffering. “Revive me according to Your word” is the piel imperative
of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>חָיָה</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(chayah) and means to
refresh. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Daleth. My soul cleaves to the dust; Revive me according
to Your word.&quot;  (Psalms 119:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;By the sweat of your face You will eat bread, Till you
return to the ground, Because from it you were taken; For you are dust, And to
dust you shall return.&quot;&quot;  (Genesis 3:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He said, &quot;Go your way, Daniel, for these words are
concealed and sealed up until the end time.&quot;  (Daniel 12:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:26, “I have told of my ways” is confession
of wicked ways. “You have answered me” means he confessed his sins to God the
Father and was restored to fellowship. “Teach me Your statutes” means now he
can learn more Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I have told of my ways, and You have answered me; Teach
me Your statutes.&quot;  (Psalms 119:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:27, “Make me understand” is the hiphil
causative of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>בּין</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(bı̂yn) and means
cause me to be able to apply from my frame of reference. Let me apply the
doctrine I have in my soul. “So I will meditate on Your wonders” refers to his
intent to witness to these soldiers.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Make me understand the way of Your precepts, So I will
meditate on Your wonders.&quot;  (Psalms 119:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:28, “My soul weeps because of grief” is the
inner cries from extreme pressure, the whimpering of a person who is suffering
beyond endurance. He could lose his mind at this point. He is depressed and is
in danger of losing his patriotism or becoming bitter. “Strengthen me according
to Your word” is the piel imperative of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>קוּם</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>(qûm) and means to build muscle by lifting weights and refers to
exercising spiritually with Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;My soul weeps because of grief; Strengthen me according
to Your word.&quot;  (Psalms 119:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:29, “Remove the false way from me” means to
cause one to turn aside from the way of vanity. “Remove” is the hiphil
infinitive of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>סוּר</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(sûr) and means to
take away, remove, to turn aside. The “false way” refers to the details of
life. He could play up to the guards and get extra food and extra favors. “Graciously
grant me Your law” refers to Bible doctrine. Be gracious to me with Bible
doctrine.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Remove the false way from me, And graciously grant me
Your law.&quot;  (Psalms 119:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:30, “I have chosen the faithful way” means
he has chosen the way of doctrine. “I have placed Your ordinances before me”
means he knows this is the only way to go at any time. He is satisfied with
what God is doing. He is not whining about his fate or bemoaning the fact that
he is on this death march. He is resting in the Lord’s provision.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I have chosen the faithful way; I have placed Your
ordinances before me.&quot;  (Psalms 119:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:31, “I cling” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>דּבק</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(dâbaq) and means to cling or adhere, figuratively to
catch by pursuit. It means his soul is glued to Bible doctrine. There is not
enough misery, trauma, etc. in this world to destroy the soul that is glued to
Bible doctrine. “Do not put me to shame” is the hiphil imperfect of <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>בּוּשׁ</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(bûsh). The action is not completed. He
is looking down the line and saying, “Don’t let me get confused down the line
by the prolonging of pressure.”</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I cling to Your testimonies; O LORD, do not put me to
shame!&quot;  (Psalms 119:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:32, “I shall run the way of Your
commandments” means he can’t run anywhere because he is chained physically, but
his soul can still seek refuge in the Word. “Enlarge my heart” means more
spiritual growth, more capacity to handle the situations. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I shall run the way of Your commandments, For You will
enlarge my heart.&quot;  (Psalms 119:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>He File – The Perspective of the Believer</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew letter He means window or the perspective of
the believer. He is looking out of the window of his life with divine
viewpoint. This is the daytime part of the march when they are on the move. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:33, “Teach me” refers to the doctrine
learned through the grace apparatus for perception. “Statutes” refers to Bible
doctrine in the right lobe of the soul. Hunger for the Word of God is
characterized by parents teaching doctrine daily to their children, the
pastor-teacher’s daily teaching of Bible doctrine, the believer accepting that
doctrine by faith and then applying it to life’s situations and problems. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He. Teach me, O LORD, the way of Your statutes, And I
shall observe it to the end.&quot;  (Psalms 119:33, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“I shall observe it” means to guard it in their soul. “To
the end” means until the end of the death march or the end of his life for
death is imminent. The principle here is to never look back. If you fall down,
get back in fellowship and keep moving. This is the principle of being
faithful. Jude 1:24.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling, and to
make you stand in the presence of His glory blameless with great joy,&quot; 
(Jude 1:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:34, “Give me understanding” means
comprehension, a spiritual frame of reference and actually using the Word of
God by applying it. “That I may observe Your law” refers to Bible doctrine
categories. These categories include the doctrine of relationship and
fellowship, the doctrine of confession of sin, the doctrine of claiming God's
promises, and the doctrine of faith-rest. “Keep it” is keeping everything in perspective,
seeing the panorama of God’s Word. “With all my heart” is with the whole inner
being, the soul having a well-filled frame of reference.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Give me understanding, that I may observe Your law And
keep it with all my heart.&quot;  (Psalms 119:34, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:35, “Walk in the path of Your commandments”
is living the spiritual life according to the will of God revealed in the Word
of God. Following the plan of God is the most important thing a believer can
do. “For I delight in it” means he has a love affair with God's commandments.
The word “commandments” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL>מצוה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(mitsvâh) and means Bible doctrine obeyed
and applied with pleasure. When the chips are down, you finally appreciate the
Word of God for what it is.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Make me walk in the path of Your commandments, For I
delight in it.&quot;  (Psalms 119:35, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:36, “Incline” means to draw my thoughts to
you. “Testimonies” refers to remembering the essence of God. “Dishonest gain”
refers to someone he envies who isn’t on the death march, has it easy, and is
enjoying the details of life. Greater is He that is in you, that he (Satan)
that is in the world. 1 John 4:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Incline my heart to Your testimonies And not to dishonest
gain.&quot;  (Psalms 119:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“You are from God, little children, and have overcome them;
because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world.” (1 John 4:4,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:37, “from looking at vanity” refers to the
emptiness of it all. The emptiness of life apart from Bible doctrine. “Revive
me in Your ways” is a spiritual revival of the soul through learning,
accepting, and applying Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Turn away my eyes from looking at vanity, And revive me
in Your ways.&quot;  (Psalms 119:37, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:38, “Establish Your word to Your servant”
refers to making Bible doctrine a part of their soul structure – the
edification complex of the soul.  “Reverence for You” means spiritual growth
becomes a devotion with the mind of Jesus Christ and occupation with Him.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Establish Your word to Your servant, As that which
produces reverence for You.&quot;  (Psalms 119:38, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:39-40, “Turn away my reproach” is the
failure that often occurs after a night of debauchery. He has seen enough and
experienced enough brutality that it can affect his mental attitude. “Which I
dread” means he doesn’t want to get out of fellowship when they abuse him.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Turn away my reproach which I dread, For Your ordinances
are good. Behold, I long for Your precepts; Revive me through Your
righteousness.&quot;  (Psalms 119:39-40, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Behold, I long for Your precepts” is Bible doctrine that
he longs to hear communicated to him.  “Revive me through Your righteousness”
is the spiritual growth and the change of thinking that Bible doctrine brings. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What is his prospective? Day after day learning Bible
doctrine, using it, applying it. Every step he takes, he takes with doctrine.
What can we do for our young people? Give them more categorical doctrine, and
more, and more, and more. There will be a time of maximum intake, and little
application, but the time of testing that will require maximum application of
Bible doctrine will come.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Vav File - Bible Doctrine Anchors the Believer’s Life</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew letter Vav represents a nail, peg or hook.
Bible doctrine is presented as the peg or the hook on which the believer hangs
their life. The peg or the hook stays in one place and produces stability.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:41, “May Your lovingkindnesses also come”
means God's grace in action. God never treats us as we deserve. This is
appreciation for His grace and Bible doctrine circulating in the thought
pattern of the soul. “Your salvation” refers to deliverance, not being saved as
he is already a believer.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Vav. May Your lovingkindnesses also come to me, O LORD,
Your salvation according to Your word;&quot;  (Psalms 119:41, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“According to Your word” means the deliverance from this
death march by application of Bible doctrine to every tough situation. He
doesn’t especially want to escape the pain. He doesn’t want to be delivered by
human activity. He wants the spiritual deliverance, which God has through Bible
doctrine. The only standard for soul stability is the assimilation of the Word
of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:42, “an answer for him who reproaches me”
refers to a griping, miserable buddy who didn’t get Bible doctrine. “Reproach”
is the qal active participle of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>חָרַף</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(charaph) and means
to malign, to deplore, to revile, to resent. They resented him to the point of
reviling him. Christians can be cruel in their negative volition.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So I will have an answer for him who reproaches me, For I
trust in Your word.&quot;  (Psalms 119:42, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Apparently he was receiving a lot of verbal insults from
the other slaves. They resented divine viewpoint and orientation to God's
grace. Believers and/or unbelievers without doctrine can be very obnoxious. He
not only has to put up with the soldiers, but he had to put up with rotten
attitudes among others on the death march. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“For I trust in Your word” is the qal perfect of  <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>בּטח</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(bâṭach) and means to slam your troubles
on the Lord as a wrestler slams his opponent to the mat.  This indicates that
he has already placed this in the Lord’s hands and he is sitting tight. Put the
matter in the Lord’s hands and do not retaliate. Vengeance belongs to the Lord.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:43, “And do not take the word of truth”
refers to the peg or hook, the stabilizer. “Take” is the hiphil imperfect
causative of  <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>נצל</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(nâtsal) and means
to snatch away. “Out of my mouth” means he will utter grace words and divine
viewpoint. When he does, they will be snatched away. He is talking about
witnessing to them and their resulting negative reactions.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And do not take the word of truth utterly out of my
mouth, For I wait for Your ordinances.&quot;  (Psalms 119:43, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“For I wait for Your ordinances” means he is trusting in
God's promises under pressure. “Wait” is the piel perfect of <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>יחל</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(yâchal) and means to be patient, to hope,
to trust, to wait. He has put his hope in Bible doctrine, regardless of the
pressure. Believers are to meet opposition by trusting in God's promises and
His deliverance. Psalms 55:22</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Cast your burden upon the LORD and He will sustain you;
He will never allow the righteous to be shaken.&quot;  (Psalms 55:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We must meet retaliation by claiming the promise of
Romans 12:19. Forgive as Christ forgave. Phil. 3:13.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Never take your own revenge, beloved, but leave room for
the wrath of God, for it is written, &quot;VENGEANCE IS MINE, I WILL
REPAY,&quot; says the Lord.&quot;  (Romans 12:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of
it yet; but one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to
what lies ahead,&quot;  (Philippians 3:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:44, “So I will keep Your law” means he will
guard the Word. The nail is in the wall forever. He intends to hang his entire
life on that hook called Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So I will keep Your law continually, Forever and
ever.&quot;  (Psalms 119:44, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:45, “I will walk at liberty” means he will
walk in comprehensiveness, in breadth of mind. He is saying, “I am too weak to
walk physically, so I am going to walk by what I think.” He has the Word in the
right lobe of his soul in his frame of reference. “For I seek Your precepts” is
Bible doctrine presented categorically, line upon line, precept upon precept.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And I will walk at liberty, For I seek Your
precepts.&quot;  (Psalms 119:45, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:46, “I will also speak of Your testimonies”
refers to Old Testament Christology where he was centering Jesus Christ in his
thoughts. “Before kings” means he will survive to speak to Persian kings, to
stand before Nebuchadnezzar. He knows that Bible doctrine will give him an
audience at some time. Bible doctrine will give you an audience. “And shall not
be ashamed” is reference to the Bible doctrine in his soul. Rom. 1:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I will also speak of Your testimonies before kings And
shall not be ashamed.&quot;  (Psalms 119:46, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power
of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the
Greek.&quot;  (Romans 1:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is a walking Bible class in embryo form. By the time
they arrive in Babylon, they have a core of people who are interested in Bible
doctrine. In 536 BC, the first wave will go back and in 516 BC the first temple
will be completed. Why? A surge of interest in learning Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:47, “I shall delight” is the hithpael
imperfect of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שָׁעַע</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(shaa) and means to take
delight in. This is the Hebrew word for the strongest love between husband and
wife. It is the Hebrew word for passionate love. Here, he has a passionate love
for the Word and an intimacy with it. Keep on doing this. Doctrine every day. This
is the word he uses in reference to his love for the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I shall delight in Your commandments, Which I
love.&quot;  (Psalms 119:47, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He uses a strong word to indicate strong love under
adverse conditions. When used of God, it is expressed as a mental attitude
love, it is relaxed mental attitude rapport love all the way, it is occupation
with Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He is courting Bible doctrine every chance he gets. He is
living in the Word. He is tough. “Which I love” is in the perfect tense and
means he has always loved doctrine. Since he is carrying Bible doctrine, he can
teach it on the march. Apparently they need it. These people will be the basis
of the Golden Age of Israel.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:48, “And I shall lift up my hands” is
fervent desire. This is as close as he can come to expressing the love concept
of “I will delight.” At this time, he has no hope of a wife, yet he will have a
very wonderful wife. At this time he has no hope of a home, yet he will have a
very wonderful home. At this time he has no hope of a job, yet he will be
occupied in a very wonderful way.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And I shall lift up my hands to Your commandments, Which
I love; And I will meditate on Your statutes.&quot;  (Psalms 119:48, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What does he have now? Nothing. Yet, he has everything in
Bible doctrine in the right lobe of his soul. This is divine wisdom. He has the
most right now. “Your commandments, Which I love” is in the perfect tense and
means he has always loved Bible doctrine, the Word of God.  “And I will
meditate on Your statutes” refers to his thought control while in fellowship
focused only on Bible doctrine.</p>
