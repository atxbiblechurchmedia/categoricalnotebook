<h2>Angelic Conflict, The Suffering Issue</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Angelic Conflict also answers, “Why suffering?” Suffering
in the Angelic Conflict comes from volition to either utilize or not utilize
God’s grace. God demonstrates that man’s volition after salvation can make
decisions compatible with His will and His Word and further put down Satan. God
can demonstrate His love to us through suffering only in our time on earth as
believers. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We know that man is inherently sinful from possession of
the old sin nature and from the imputation of Adam’s original sin at physical
birth. Add to this the fact that Satan is the ruler of this world and it
explains much of why there is suffering in the world. People suffer due to bad
decisions, bad judgments, and from their sins. They also suffer from
consequences of other people’s bad decisions, bad judgments, and sins. Then
there is the fact that Satan rules this world and that there are millions of
his demons in operation on the earth today. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers suffer when they are negative to Bible
doctrine. Divine discipline is suffering administered by God to cause them to
return to fellowship with Him. Suffering can also occur during spiritual
testing which, if passed, results in spiritual growth for the believer. The
suffering believer gains blessing from God if they elect to use God's grace
resources to solve life’s problems. If they decide instead to use their human
resources, that results in human good which is considered worthless to God. So,
apart from spiritual growth, all reasons for suffering are directly related to
the Angelic Conflict. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Job became the focus of the Angelic Conflict as an Old
Testament example of how a mature believer handled severe testing. Satan
thought that God was protecting him with a hedge, etc. So, Job became the
center for the Angelic Conflict at one point.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our greatest blessings come to us through our greatest
sufferings when we apply Bible doctrine (<i>epignosis</i>), use faith-rest, and
faith-patience from a doctrinal frame of reference and keep on being occupied
with Jesus Christ. This is basically why believers suffer and it is actually
designed to bless you. 1 Peter 1:7-8.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;so that the proof of your faith, being more precious than
gold which is perishable, even though tested by fire, may be found to result in
praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ; and though you
have not seen Him, you love Him, and though you do not see Him now, but believe
in Him, you greatly rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory,&quot;  (1
Peter 1:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are 12 different reasons why believers suffer. This
is one to parlay faith-rest into occupation with Christ because occupation with
Christ is spiritual maturity. Suffering is absolutely necessary. Our spiritual
maturity comes through undeserved suffering, which also causes maximum blessing
from God and maximum spiritual growth. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 2:17, “Therefore, He had to be made like His
brethren in all things” states that in the circumstances of our Lord’s
incarnation, He became a true member of the human race. Literally, in all
things He was obligated – the imperfect active indicative. What was His
obligation? </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore, He had to be made like His brethren in all
things, so that He might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things
pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.&quot; 
(Hebrews 2:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“To be made like (aorist passive infinitive) his
brethren” means to become a true member of the human race and remains so for
all eternity. Christ received a human body (infinitive of purpose). God the
Father’s purpose was to resolve the Angelic Conflict. Ever since Genesis 3:15,
God was obligated to bring Christ to the earth.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And I will put enmity Between you and the woman, And
between your seed and her seed; He shall bruise you on the head, And you shall
bruise him on the heel.&quot;&quot;  (Genesis 3:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There a four reasons for the humanity of Jesus Christ.
The first reason is to be our Savior. Heb. 2:14-15; Phil. 2:5-8.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood,
He Himself likewise also partook of the same, that through death He might
render powerless him who had the power of death, that is, the devil, and might
free those who through fear of death were subject to slavery all their
lives.&quot;  (Hebrews 2:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ
Jesus, who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality
with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a
bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men. Being found in appearance
as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even
death on a cross.&quot;  (Philippians 2:5-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The second reason is to be our mediator. Job 9:2; Job
9:32-33. Job 9 makes it very clear that a mediator has to be equal to the two
parties in the reconciliation. Jesus Christ is God and co-equal and co-eternal
with God the Father and God the Holy Spirit. Jesus Christ is also sinless man
and therefore the God-Man. 1 Tim. 2:5-6. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;In truth I know that this is so; But how can a man
be in the right before God?&quot;  (Job 9:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;For He is not a man as I am that I may answer Him,
That we may go to court together. &quot;There is no umpire between us, Who may
lay his hand upon us both.&quot;  (Job 9:32-33, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For there is one God, and one mediator also between God
and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave Himself as a ransom for all, the
testimony given at the proper time.&quot;  (1 Timothy 2:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The third reason is to be our high-priest. Heb. 7:4-5; Heb.
7:14; Heb. 7:28; Heb. 10:5-19. A priest is a man representing man before God. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now observe how great this man was to whom Abraham, the
patriarch, gave a tenth of the choicest spoils. And those indeed of the sons of
Levi who receive the priest's office have commandment in the Law to collect a
tenth from the people, that is, from their brethren, although these are
descended from Abraham.&quot;  (Hebrews 7:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah,
a tribe with reference to which Moses spoke nothing concerning priests.&quot; 
(Hebrews 7:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For the Law appoints men as high priests who are weak,
but the word of the oath, which came after the Law, appoints a Son, made
perfect forever.&quot;  (Hebrews 7:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fourth reason is to be a king to the Jews. 2 Sam.
7:8-16; Psalms 89:20-37. The Davidic Covenant. Luke 1:31-33. Mary is descended
from David through Nathan, the son of David. Joseph is descended from David
through Solomon, another son of David. One of them in the line from Solomon is
Coniah who God said was going to be cut out of the Davidic Covenant as far as lineage.
Jer. 22:30. So Joseph is from this side, but was not Jesus’ true father. Christ
is physically Mary’s son and legally Joseph’s son.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Your house and your kingdom shall endure before Me
forever; your throne shall be established forever.&quot;'&quot;&quot;  (2
Samuel 7:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear
a son, and you shall name Him Jesus. &quot;He will be great and will be called
the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His
father David; and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and His
kingdom will have no end.&quot;&quot;  (Luke 1:31-33, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Thus says the LORD, 'Write this man down childless,
A man who will not prosper in his days; For no man of his descendants will
prosper Sitting on the throne of David Or ruling again in Judah.'&quot;&quot; 
(Jeremiah 22:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 2:17, “a merciful and faithful high priest”
means Jesus Christ is merciful in grace based on love. Grace depends on who and
what Jesus Christ is! He is always faithful in grace based on His immutability.
“In things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people”
refers to propitiation not reconciliation. It took three horrible hours on the
Cross in His substitutionary spiritual death to propitiate the perfect justice
of God the Father!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The suffering of Christ as a High Priest is presented in
Hebrews 2:18. “In that which He has suffered” is the perfect tense and means
permanent benefits forever. The active voice means that He did it. He suffered
for our blessing. “Tempted” is <span lang=EL>πειρα</span>́<span lang=EL>ζω</span>
(peirazō) and means to test one for good or bad.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For since He Himself was tempted in that which He has
suffered, He is able to come to the aid of those who are tempted.&quot; 
(Hebrews 2:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Another word for test is <span lang=EL>δοκιμα</span>́<span
lang=EL>ζω</span> (dokimazō) and means to test to bring out the good in them.
Jesus Christ was tested constantly to see what He was made of in His humanity.
Since Jesus Christ knows more about testing and suffering than any human being
that every lived, there is sustaining of the believer as a result. “He is able
to come to the aid of those who are tempted” is the aorist infinitive of <span
lang=EL>βοηθε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (boētheō) and means it is His
purpose for Him to come to our help whenever we cry for help. It is to our
advantage to be tested periodically. We receive testing for the purpose of
blessing. This is grace blessing of a believer who doesn’t earn it or deserve
it. A believer who goes through suffering causes the angels who are watching us
to see the grace of God. Eph. 3:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;so that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made
known through the church to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly
places.&quot;  (Ephesians 3:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ephesians 3:10 ,“rulers and the authorities” refers to
the leadership of fallen angels or demons. Eph 6:12.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but
against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this
darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly
places.&quot;  (Ephesians 6:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Why do you suffer in unexplained ways? Some think that
every time they suffer, it’s because they have done something wrong. Their
problem is that they don’t have any doctrine in their souls from which to think
of God’s promises and plan for their lives.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If you live by a guilt complex and emotionalism, then
there really isn’t much you can do for yourself. You just go on being
miserable. We make ourselves miserable - self-induced misery. You should never
think suffering is always for punishment. When you suffer, the angels are
watching you and you can be a testimony to angels. Suffer and make it count.
Confession of sin using 1 John 1:9 makes the difference. Don’t mess up a
beautiful plan, a beautiful grace program which God has for your life. Don’t
bring in self-induced suffering. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This explains why He doesn’t take us out of the world.
Christ must have representation or ambassadors on earth in His absence. Why
suffering? Because the greatest blessings we could ever receive from God come
to us in the spiritual life resulting from suffering.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Satanic world system causes a great amount of
deserved suffering. However, confession of known sins to God the Father that
results in restoration of the Filling of the Holy Spirit takes care of deserved
suffering. The Satanic world system also causes a great amount of undeserved
suffering. The doctrine of positional truth takes care of undeserved suffering.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>How does positional truth connected with undeserved
suffering solve the Angelic Conflict? Through positive volition, we chose to
identify with Christ and become sons of God, no matter what the suffering and
go on to spiritual maturity. The Lord Jesus Christ is waiting for the
completion of the Bride. Jesus Christ wants the Bride to respond to all the
Bible doctrine He teaches through His written Word – the very thinking of Jesus
Christ. 1 Cor. 2:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL
INSTRUCT HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Therefore, the expression of positional truth is the
ultimate in mutual undeserved suffering. This undeserved suffering of “many
sons” will continue until physical death or the Rapture and is the maximum
application of Bible doctrine in the spiritual life. Heb. 2:10-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things, and
through whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to perfect the
author of their salvation through sufferings. For both He who sanctifies and
those who are sanctified are all from one Father; for which reason He is not
ashamed to call them brethren,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 2:10-11, NASB)</p>
