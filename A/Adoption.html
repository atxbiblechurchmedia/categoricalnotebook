<h2><a name="_Adoption_1"></a>Adoption </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Adoption is the voluntary legal acceptance of a child born
of other parents to be the same as one's own biological child. As believers, we
are all adopted as sons of God at salvation. Rom. 8:15; Gal. 4:5.</p>

<p class=Verses> “For you have not received a spirit of slavery leading to fear
again, but you have received a spirit of adoption as sons by which we cry out, “Abba!
Father!”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 8:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“so that He might redeem those who were under the Law, that we
might receive the adoption as sons.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Galatians 4:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Believer’s Adoption at Salvation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Adoption is one of the 40 things which every believer
receives at the moment of salvation. Adoption is always connected with
Positional Truth where the Holy Spirit enters the believer into Union with
Christ. This is called the Baptism of the Holy Spirit and are the mechanics of
this spiritual adoption. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When we are entered into Union with Christ at the point
of salvation, we become adult sons  (<i>huios</i> in the Greek) positionally.
This is our adoption. At the same time, we are entered into fellowship with
Jesus Christ which involves the filling of the Holy Spirit. This speaks of our
experience in time and experientially we are called <i>nepios</i> which means
little child, or sometimes <i>brephos</i> which means a babe on the mother’s
breast.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As little children, we need to grow up spiritually. In 1
John 3:1, <i>teknon</i> is for sons - the one who is caught with his hand in
the cookie jar. As adult sons, we have the rights of an adult, operation of
volition, heirs, etc.</p>

<p class=Verses>“See how great a love the Father has bestowed on us, that we
would be called children of God; and such we are. For this reason the world
does not know us, because it did not know Him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 John 3:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Adoption in the Ancient World</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Bible must be interpreted in the time in which it was
written (Isagogics). Adoption in the ancient world (in the Roman Empire) had to
do with children born into the family - blood relations. Every father adopted
his son at age 14, at which time he received adult status with adult
privileges. For the first 14 years, a son was put under slaves. Someone took
him to school (called in Galatians a pedagogue) and he protected him from being
kidnapped. Some tutored him. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sons were barely as good as slaves for the first 14
years. They wore a robe called a toga of youth and it always had the same
pattern or design. You could always tell a child’s age by the type of robe. On
his 14th birthday, the whole family were gathered together and the boy was
brought in wearing his toga of youth for the last time. His father stepped
forward and took the toga by the shoulders and lifted his left hand and dropped
it to the floor.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A slave standing there took another toga called the toga
virilis (robe of manhood) and gave it to the father who took this robe and put
it around his son and then usually for the last time kissed his son. Then he
stepped back and said, “My son, you have now been adopted into the family.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Adoption meant that they were now an adult and this gave
them certain privileges. The privilege of voting. He was allowed to manage
money for the first time. He could now get married. He could enter military
service. He was now regarded as an adult at age 14. Life span was shorter then,
so they became adults sooner.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Adoption dealt with a natural child of a family, an heir.
He was now no longer under slaves, but now commanded them. Adoption meant
taking someone already in the family and recognizing him as an adult son. The
Greek word <i>thesia</i> means to place. To place one who is already a son or
son recognition. <i>Thesia</i> has been translated “adoption.”</p>
