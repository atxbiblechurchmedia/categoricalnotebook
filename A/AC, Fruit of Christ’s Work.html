<h2>Angelic Conflict, The Fruit of Christ’s Work</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fruit of Christ’s work in the Angelic Conflict is
always focused on His victory over sin and death on the Cross and with Jesus
Christ now seated at the right hand of God the Father in session in the third
heaven. The Body of Christ composed of Church Age believers will be completed
and will trigger the Rapture of the Church. There is oneness in the Body of
Christ because of Positional Truth. God’s plan and procedure is documented in the
Word. Heb. 2:10-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things, and
through whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to perfect the
author of their salvation through sufferings. For both He who sanctifies and
those who are sanctified are all from one Father; for which reason He is not
ashamed to call them brethren, saying, “I WILL PROCLAIM YOUR NAME TO MY
BRETHREN, IN THE MIDST OF THE CONGREGATION I WILL SING YOUR PRAISE.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews
2:10-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 2:10, “For” relates it to the Second Advent of
Jesus Christ where He defeats all of His enemies and prepares the earth for His
Millennial Kingdom. The Father always had a perfect plan that provided Jesus
Christ a perfect kingdom on earth. “It was fitting for Him” is an impersonal
verb denoting inner fitness. Look, God says, “I’m going to show you how I can
take care of you under the most horrible conditions, the most adverse
conditions, under the most difficult conditions.”</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things, and
through whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to perfect the
author of their salvation through sufferings.&quot;  (Hebrews 2:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When God can put together a company of clods, clucks and
misfits and give them a perfect position in Christ based on their free will
decision to accept the work of Jesus Christ on the Cross, it makes Satan grind
his teeth. God has a perfect plan. Satan opposes God's perfect plan with
religion based on legalism and works tirelessly to deceive and obfuscate
anything related to God, the Savior Jesus Christ and grace.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Through whom are all things” means because of whom and
through whom are all things. “All things” refers to the plan of God. Before
Salvation, God is perfect and His plan is perfect. Salvation provided
propitiation, reconciliation, and redemption. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We can’t help God in any of these grace gifts at
salvation. Salvation also provides unlimited atonement, justification preceded
by imputation, and positional truth with all Church Age believers placed into
union with Jesus Christ by the Holy Spirit. Whenever we are commanded to do
something, it is a non-meritorious grace activity. The human race paces back
and forth past the door of salvation. Positive signals cause them to enter the
door by faith and the elect angels rejoice.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>After salvation, God provides the spiritual life and
enables us to execute that life using only His grace resources. This is the
Church Age spiritual life that includes spirituality, the grace apparatus for
perception that enables every believer to understand and apply the very
thinking of Jesus Christ, prayer directly to God the Father as
believer-priests, confession of sin to regain the filling of the Holy Spirit,
control of the soul by the Holy Spirit so we can walk in the Spirit, and dying
grace where we can anticipate our transfer to heaven where we will be
face-to-face with the Lord for eternity. Eternity will have no more sorrow, no
more tears, no more pain, no more death, the old things are passed away. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 2:10, “in bringing many sons to glory” refers
to all who believe in the Church Age being brought to glory through belief in
the work of Christ on the Cross. This is grace! He sent His Son to gain many
sons. Why many sons? These sons are believers of the Church Age only that is
being completed person by person in the dispensation of the Church Age. Satan
tries to slow the process down to further put off his execution date. He
attacks salvation and he attacks spirituality. When we were saved, we became
positionally higher than the angels. At the Rapture of the Church, we will be
physically superior to angels in our resurrection bodies - Ultimate
Sanctification. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>How can you hold your own in the devil’s world? Through
the filling of the Holy Spirit. Sons of God in the Old Testament refers to
angels (the plural of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>מלאך</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(mal'âk) in the
Hebrew). The Son of God refers to Jesus Christ. “Children” or “sons of God” is <span
lang=EL>ε</span>̔<span lang=EL>τεροδιδασκαλε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(heterodidaskaleō) in the Greek and refers to Church Age believers.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 2:10, “to perfect” refers to advancing a
person to a state of completion. Spartans were taken away from their parents at
age 7. They were trained mentally and physically for combat to age 18. By age
18, they were accomplished warriors and their training was completed. They were
ready for combat. Thus, “to perfect” means to reach a state of completion, to
advance to the completion of the project. “Through sufferings” refers to the
Cross. He suffered every time a sin and it’s judgment hit Him. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When Jesus Christ arrived in heaven and was invited by
God the Father to sit at His right hand, He arrived alone. He was the First
Fruits. Almost immediately, souls began to arrive. They will continue to arrive
until the Body of Christ (made up of Church Age believers) is complete. This
completion of the Body of Christ will trigger the Rapture of the Church. Jesus
Christ will complete in the sense that the Body will be complete. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is a phony idea out there today that we help our
children by making life tough for them. Parents express their selfishness this
way. We’re not going to give them this or that, let them earn it, let them work
for it. “I had a hard time as a child, so my children will have a hard time!”
“Life’s no featherbed. They’ve got to learn the hard way.” “Let him go out and
get a job, it’ll make a man out of him.” I know a lot of people who went out at
age 14 and started working, but it didn’t make a better person out of them.
They have no concept of grace. It doesn’t build character to make kids work.
This doesn’t make them better people. Character comes through Bible doctrine in
the right lobe of their souls through the filling of the Spirit. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As parents, if you came from a wealthy home and never had
to work your way through college, that did not make you better or worse than
those who had to work. If you have character, being given things won’t bother
you. Use the grace basis in raising your children. Some have had to work for
everything they have and they are the sorriest people you’ve ever seen. Some
have never worked for a thing and they are wonderful people. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When your teenage children get a speeding ticket, do you
throw the book at them or do you relax? Some of you will never get this
principle and some may even resent it. Whether you get it, resent it,
misrepresent it, or misquote it, the challenge of grace is always there. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the point of salvation, every believer received Positional
Sanctification (Positional Truth via the Baptism of the Holy Spirit). We are
permanently placed into union with Jesus Christ by God the Holy Spirit. As we
live our spiritual lives, we gain progressive sanctification through the intake
and application of <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine. In eternity, we will
receive Ultimate Sanctification and live with Jesus Christ forever. It really
chaps the devil that believers positionally have a high position, higher than
himself.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 2:11, “For both He who sanctifies and those who
are sanctified are all from one Father” means that believers sanctified in
Jesus Christ (positional truth) and Jesus Christ Himself are from God the
Father. “He is not ashamed” is in the present tense and means He continually is
never ashamed of us. Never. The dative of advantage also means that it is to
our advantage what Christ has done! Because of this union, Jesus Christ is not
ashamed to call us brethren. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For both He who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are
all from one Father; for which reason He is not ashamed to call them brethren,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews
2:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Have you ever been ashamed of anyone? What about someone
who attends your local church? What about some other believer who attends some
other local church? What about a believer that may not attend any local church?
Have you ever been ashamed of your pastor-teacher? Jesus Christ has never been
ashamed of any believer. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 2:12, “I will proclaim” is an announcement and
refers to Jesus Christ in session seated at the right hand of God the Father.
Psalms 22:22; 1 Cor. 2:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;saying, &quot;I WILL PROCLAIM YOUR NAME TO MY BRETHREN,
IN THE MIDST OF THE CONGREGATION I WILL SING YOUR PRAISE.&quot;&quot;  (Hebrews
2:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I will tell of Your name to my brethren; In the midst of
the assembly I will praise You.&quot;  (Psalms 22:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL
INSTRUCT HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 2:12, “Your name” is the name of God the
Father. This refers to the writing of the Word of God. “To my brethren” refers
to the believer as the recipient of Bible doctrine. “In the midst of the
congregation I will sing your praise” means that the response of the believer
will sing a hymn with the lyrics being Scripture, Bible doctrine, the thinking
of Jesus Christ. </p>
