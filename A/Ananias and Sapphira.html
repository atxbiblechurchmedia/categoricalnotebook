<h2><a name="_Ananias_and_Sapphira"></a><a name="_D-Ananias_and_Sapphira"></a>Ananias
and Sapphira</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Probably the most vivid examples of the consequences of
lying to the Holy Spirit are Ananias and Sapphira. Lying to the Holy Spirit is
performing what outwardly appears to be a good work or divine good, but has
been done deceitfully with sinful motivation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ananias and Sapphira were two believers in the early
Church who let their sin natures control them. Their sin natures had a trend
toward asceticism and they acted from their area of strength. This was a sin
inside of the church committed by believers. It was sin motivated by
approbation lust (desire to be noticed, appreciated). They desired to duplicate
the feat of Barnabas who had sold a piece of property and had given the whole
price to the Lord’s work in Jerusalem.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ananias and Sapphira were competing with Barnabas. Such
competition was unnecessary. They were playing “spiritual king of the mountain.”
Behind their lust for flattery and praise was envy and jealousy, which is the
basis of the sin. Ananias and Sapphira sold a piece of property also, and gave
part of the proceeds to the Lord’s work, but they intimated that they gave the
entire price. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There was nothing wrong with keeping back part of the
price of such a sale. There is no biblical regulation as to how much a believer
should give. The sin was in telling the lie, the mental attitude sins behind
it, envy, jealousy, and the desire behind it - approbation lust. 1 Cor. 16:2. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;On the first day of every week each one of you is to put
aside and save, as he may prosper, so that no collections be made when I
come.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 16:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They lied because they wanted the church to think that
they had duplicated the giving of Barnabas. In lying to the church, they had
lied to the Holy Spirit. Behind everything was approbation lust which is one of
the believer’s greatest enemies. It causes the believer to serve in the energy
of the flesh and to produce human good instead of divine good. They failed to
serve as unto the Lord. Col. 3:17. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of
the Lord Jesus, giving thanks through Him to God the Father.&quot;  (Colossians
3:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Their production from the old sin nature from its area of
strength will be considered wood, hay and stubble at the Judgment Seat of
Christ. The Lord judged Ananias and Sapphira severely by the “sin unto death.” The
significance of this severe discipline by God was the protection of the early Church
from this type of activity - human works motivated by approbation lust. See
category on <a href="#_D-The_Sin_Unto">The Sin Unto Death</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses> “But a man named Ananias, with his wife Sapphira, sold a piece
of property, and kept back some of the price for himself, with his wife’s full
knowledge, and bringing a portion of it, he laid it at the apostles’ feet. But
Peter said, “Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit
and to keep back some of the price of the land? “While it remained unsold, did
it not remain your own? And after it was sold, was it not under your control?
Why is it that you have conceived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to
men but to God.” And as he heard these words, Ananias fell down and breathed
his last; and great fear came over all who heard of it.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts
5:1-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It was a sin inside of the church committed by believers.
It was not a sin of omission nor in the giving. It was a sin motivated by
approbation lust. They desired to duplicate the giving of Barnabas. It was a
sin of competition.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now there elapsed an interval of about three hours, and his
wife came in, not knowing what had happened. And Peter responded to her, “Tell
me whether you sold the land for such and such a price?” And she said, “Yes,
that was the price.” Then Peter said to her, “Why is it that you have agreed
together to put the Spirit of the Lord to the test? Behold, the feet of those
who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out as
well.” And immediately she fell at his feet and breathed her last, and the
young men came in and found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her
beside her husband.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 5:7-10, NASB)</p>
