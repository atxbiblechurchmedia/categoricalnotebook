<h2><a name="_Maximum_Adversity,_Believer’s_1"></a>Maximum Adversity,
Believer’s Triumph – Part 3</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Lamedh File – Confession of Sin Returns Us to
Fellowship</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew letter Lamedh file represents an ox goad. This
was the goad that got the ox out of first gear and into second and finally into
cruising gear. The lamedh file speaks of confession of known sins to God the
Father that puts us back into fellowship with the Lord and into spiritual
usefulness. The confession of sin offering in the Word was an ox or a red
heifer. In a study of the Levitical offerings, Christ represents the ox who
died on the Cross for our sins. The goad was Christ bearing our sins.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:89, “Forever” means eternity past to
eternity future. “Your Word” is the whole realm of Bible doctrine. This existed
from eternity past and will continue to exist through eternity future. The
Bible is the mind of Christ. 1 Cor. 2:16; Psalms 138:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Lamedh. Forever, O LORD, Your word is settled in
heaven.&quot;  (Psalms 119:89, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL
INSTRUCT HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I will bow down toward Your holy temple And give thanks
to Your name for Your lovingkindness and Your truth; For You have magnified
Your word according to all Your name.&quot;  (Psalms 138:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:89, “settled in heaven” means that God’s
plan always existed in eternity past. God is perfect so His plan is perfect.
God is eternal so His plan is eternal. Therefore, the Word of God is eternal.
God's Word will never cease to exist. “Settled” is the niphil passive voice of <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>נצב</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(nâtsab) and means to receive permanence.
Matt. 24:35.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will
not pass away.&quot;  (Matthew 24:35, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:90, God’s Word reveals God’s faithfulness. “Generations”
means there is never a generation left without a witness of God (God
consciousness) or Gospel hearing. Everything depends upon the faithfulness of
God.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Your faithfulness continues throughout all generations;
You established the earth, and it stands.&quot;  (Psalms 119:90, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“You established” is the piel perfect of <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>כּוּן</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(kûn) and means to adjust, to direct, to
give cohesion, to stabilize, to provide direction and purpose. “The earth”
refers to Jesus Christ who holds the earth on course through His divine laws
and power. The Lord Jesus Christ sustains the universe. The continuation of the
universe depends upon the omnipotence and immutability of Jesus Christ. Col.
1:17; Heb. 1:3</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He is before all things, and in Him all things hold
together.&quot;  (Colossians 1:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He is the radiance of His glory and the exact
representation of His nature, and upholds all things by the word of His power.
When He had made purification of sins, He sat down at the right hand of the
Majesty on high,&quot;  (Hebrews 1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>So called “scientific laws” are not laws at all because
science has no way of enforcing them or guaranteeing them. Scientific laws are
based on the statistical assumption that the universe, which operates according
to a fixed norm, will continue to do so. Science can’t determine if the
universe and the “scientific laws” will continue as they are now. They just
assume it will. The universe, matter, energy and operational laws of the
universe will not always exist as they do now. 2 Peter 3:10-12; Rev. 20:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, in which
the heavens will pass away with a roar and the elements will be destroyed with
intense heat, and the earth and its works will be burned up. Since all these
things are to be destroyed in this way, what sort of people ought you to be in
holy conduct and godliness, looking for and hastening the coming of the day of
God, because of which the heavens will be destroyed by burning, and the
elements will melt with intense heat!&quot;  (2 Peter 3:10-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat upon it,
from whose presence earth and heaven fled away, and no place was found for
them.&quot;  (Revelation 20:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To allow God the Father’s plan to run its full course,
Jesus Christ is keeping the universe together. The laws of the universe can be
overruled and changed by Jesus Christ. Like Elijah, He cancelled gravity over
the spot where He stood and He became a free floater immediately. The laws of
the universe were overruled on the day the sun stood still for Joshua and for
certain miracles. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Known scientific laws depend entirely upon the
faithfulness of God. By the Word of His power, Jesus Christ hold the universe
together. His reason for doing so is to resolve the Angelic Conflict and to
“bring many sons to glory.” Col. 1:17; Heb. 1:3; Heb. 2:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He is before all things, and in Him all things hold
together.&quot;  (Colossians 1:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He is the radiance of His glory and the exact
representation of His nature, and upholds all things by the word of His power.
When He had made purification of sins, He sat down at the right hand of the
Majesty on high,&quot;  (Hebrews 1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things, and
through whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to perfect the
author of their salvation through sufferings.&quot;  (Hebrews 2:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Even though Jesus Christ overrules His laws whereby
miracles or supernatural phenomena can take place, He never ever overrules or
changes His promises or His Word – Bible doctrine. That He cannot change. Psalms
119:89.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Lamedh. Forever, O LORD, Your word is settled in
heaven.&quot;  (Psalms 119:89, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Therefore, scientific laws are simply the faithfulness of
Jesus Christ holding the universe together, holding back eternity so the human
race will have the opportunity to appropriate the grace of God and live by the
grace of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:91, “They stand this day” means He sees the
sun rise and He sees the sun set. The laws of the universe continue each day
according to His purpose – Bible doctrine pertaining to the person of Christ. “For
all things are Your servants” means that divine law governs the universe to
allow the earth to be the battleground for resolving the Angelic Conflict.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;They stand this day according to Your ordinances, For all
things are Your servants.&quot;  (Psalms 119:91, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:92, “If Your law had not been my delight”
uses the Hebrew word for caressing, desire, passion, and love. The Word is the
love of his life. It is his passion in life. “I would have perished in my
affliction” means the Word has made living worthwhile and is what kept him
going.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If Your law had not been my delight, Then I would have
perished in my affliction.&quot;  (Psalms 119:92, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:93, “I will never forget Your precepts”
means it is easy to forget the Word unless you have it stored as <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine in the right lobe of your soul in categories. “For by them You
have revived me” means he was not in emotional revolt. He was in fellowship.
Bible doctrine was controlling his soul.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I will never forget Your precepts, For by them You have
revived me.&quot;  (Psalms 119:93, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:94, “I am Yours, save me” means he was
praying for the Lord to deliver him. He wanted to stay alive, and wanted the
Lord to give him the strength to stand up. He wanted to have the strength to
speak each day.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>So many of these young people were so busy partying,
running around and having a good time that it never occurred to them to get
Bible doctrine. “For I have sought Your precepts” is the qal perfect of <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>דּרשׁ</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(dârash) and means to realize the value
of something in prosperity. He was looking back to the days when he learned
Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I am Yours, save me; For I have sought Your
precepts.&quot;  (Psalms 119:94, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Back in Jerusalem, when there was peace and prosperity,
when there was no Chaldean invasion, when Jerusalem was a thriving and
wonderful city, and when the normal pleasures and routines of life existed.
Most of you can plan your day and you have your routines and pleasures. Nothing
is really pressing you to get with Bible doctrine except your pastor-teacher.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:95, “The wicked wait for me to destroy me”
refers to the Chaldean soldiers who have tried to ambush him. They wish he
would die. They mock him. “I shall diligently consider Your testimonies” refers
to Bible doctrine pertaining to the person and work of the Lord Jesus Christ.
God had a purpose for him. God has a purpose for anyone who will learn Bible
doctrine. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The wicked wait for me to destroy me; I shall diligently
consider Your testimonies.&quot;  (Psalms 119:95, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:96, “I have seen a limit to all perfection”
means he was saying he was disillusioned about all people. He thought that when
the enemy came, men would be great heroes. Instead, they were cowards, adults
and young men alike. He learned the country could not be saved by people. There
is no need to depend upon people. With Bible doctrine you can enjoy people even
though they are fickle. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I have seen a limit to all perfection; Your commandment
is exceedingly broad.&quot;  (Psalms 119:96, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Your commandment are exceedingly broad” means there is
no limit to Bible doctrine, no limited what His Word can do. People are limited
and the body is limited. He was disillusioned about people, but there was no
disillusionment about Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Mem File – The Water of the Word</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew letter Mem originally signified water. It
refers to the “water of the Word” in Ephesians 5:26. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;so that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the
washing of water with the word,&quot;  (Ephesians 5:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:97, “O how I love Your law” means rapport
love, delight. “It is my meditation all the day” means it was in his thought
pattern, the right lobe of the mentality of his soul. He was constantly using
his frame of reference, recalling doctrine, having God’s norms and standards,
and recalling divine viewpoint and exercising it.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Mem. O how I love Your law! It is my meditation all the
day.&quot;  (Psalms 119:97, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“All the day” refers to the function of the grace
apparatus for perception through study and public assembly and through
meditation when you can’t study or assemble publicly. He was teaching Bible
class.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:98, “make me wiser than my enemies” means
that although he had no physical weapon, yet inside of him was the greatest
weapon of all. He had learned Bible doctrine, he understood it and was using
it. “For they are ever mine” refers to his enemies. He also always had the Word
of God in his soul to apply. With God's grace resources and according to God's
plan, he will survive and live longer than his enemies.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Your commandments make me wiser than my enemies, For they
are ever mine.&quot;  (Psalms 119:98, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:99, “I have more insight” is <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שָׂכַל</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(sakal) and means expert, skillful. “Than
all my teachers” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>למד</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(lâmad) and means to
goad, to teach with the rod. “Are my meditation” means he is experiencing
considerable thought control under the extreme pressures.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I have more insight than all my teachers, For Your
testimonies are my meditation.&quot;  (Psalms 119:99, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:100, “I understand more than the aged”
means that under extreme pressure and testing, you validate the Bible doctrine
in your soul through repeated application to life’s problems. This is divine
wisdom in the soul.  He realized that through his suffering, he had more <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine in his young soul when compared to even old men. This is
spiritual growth and erecting an edification complex of the soul as rapidly as
possible even though young in age. “Because I have observed Your precepts”
refers to the other prisoners who guarded him, but he guarded the Bible
doctrine in his soul. James 1:2-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I understand more than the aged, Because I have observed
Your precepts.&quot;  (Psalms 119:100, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter
various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance. And
let endurance have its perfect result, so that you may be perfect and complete,
lacking in nothing.&quot;  (James 1:2-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:101, “I have restrained my feet from every
evil way” refers to his resistance to false doctrine before the death march.
That is why he learned so much. Today, he wouldn’t get involved in anything
that kept him from daily learning more Bible doctrine. “That I may keep Your
word” means he put learning Bible doctrine and building his edification complex
of the soul as top priority. He even put doctrine before schoolwork.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I have restrained my feet from every evil way, That I may
keep Your word.&quot;  (Psalms 119:101, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:102, means that he adhered to doctrinal
warnings and never got away from the daily intake of the Word of God. He knew
that to do so would be disastrous to his spiritual life.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I have not turned aside from Your ordinances, For You
Yourself have taught me.&quot;  (Psalms 119:102, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:103, “How sweet are Your words to my
taste!” means he studied the Word regularly just as he ate regularly. Honey
gave stimulation, health, and nourishment. It was the candy of the ancient
world. By analogy, it protected him from false doctrine. “Sweeter than honey to
my mouth” means he considered Bible doctrine of highest importance. Job.
23:12.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;How sweet are Your words to my taste! Yes, sweeter than
honey to my mouth!&quot;  (Psalms 119:103, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;I have not departed from the command of His lips; I
have treasured the words of His mouth more than my necessary food.&quot;  (Job
23:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:104, he gets Bible doctrine categorically
in his soul and, therefore he is discerning and hates false doctrine
(religion).</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;From Your precepts I get understanding; Therefore I hate
every false way.&quot;  (Psalms 119:104, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Nun File - Provision in the Midst of Judgment</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Nun is the Hebrew letter that represents a fish. A
fish always seems to have food, shelter, and clothing. Fish escaped the
judgment on the earth in the flood. The fish stands for provision in the midst
of judgment and shows that the Lord takes care of our daily needs through Bible
doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Psalms 119:105 indicates that Bible doctrine provides the
basis for divine guidance. “Your word is a lamp” means that divine guidance for
the Christian is tied up in the Word. The Word is revealed as the mind of
Christ. The most informed believers today are the believers with Bible
doctrine. God doesn’t lead through an itch between the shoulder blades. God
doesn’t use bolts of lightning to nudge you in the right direction. God doesn’t
lead through the emotions. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Nun. Your word is a lamp to my feet And a light to my
path.&quot;  (Psalms 119:105, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:106, Bible doctrine is the answer to
production and performance and consistency. “I have sworn” means I have
conviction. “I will confirm it” refers to follow-through and desire to not fail
in keeping God's righteous ordinances – Bible doctrine. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I have sworn and I will confirm it, That I will keep Your
righteous ordinances.&quot;  (Psalms 119:106, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:107, “I am exceedingly afflicted” means he
is under maximum suffering. “Revive me” means learning and applying Bible
doctrine can be like a cold drink of water under a hot Texas sun. Bible
doctrine is the source of refreshment. It produces inner happiness even under
extreme suffering. Your social life isn’t going to refresh you ultimately.
Bible doctrine in the right lobe of your soul will.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I am exceedingly afflicted; Revive me, O LORD, according
to Your word.&quot;  (Psalms 119:107, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Psalms 119:108 means that Bible doctrine stimulates the
volition to learn more Bible doctrine when available. “Freewill offering” is
stimulation from the area of volition. He couldn’t give them money or a box of
candy. “Accept” is the qal imperative of <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>רצה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(râtsâh) and means to take pleasure in my freewill
offering. His offering was the communication of Bible doctrine. “Teach me”
means there are still some things I need to know. Believers will never learn
all of the mind of Christ no matter how long we live. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;O accept the freewill offerings of my mouth, O LORD, And
teach me Your ordinances.&quot;  (Psalms 119:108, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:109, “My life is continually in my hand” is
an idiom for being close to physical death. He was still hanging on even though
he was weak and helpless. Bible doctrine in his soul and staying in fellowship
kept him stable and focused even under these extreme conditions. “I do not
forget Your law” means that he was right on the edge and still Bible doctrine
captivated his thoughts.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;My life is continually in my hand, Yet I do not forget
Your law.&quot;  (Psalms 119:109, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:110, “The wicked have laid a snare for me”
means they have tried to trap him and get him to shut up by putting an extra
load on him. “Yet I have not gone astray from Your precepts” means that he
passed the criticism test, the destruction test, and the threatening test. The
enabling power of the Holy Spirit enabled him to stay on track and keep his
thinking focused on divine viewpoint.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The wicked have laid a snare for me, Yet I have not gone
astray from Your precepts.&quot;  (Psalms 119:110, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Psalms 119:111 speaks of Bible doctrine as our heritage
and the heritage of his Bible teachers, of his grandfather, and his father. The
greatest heritage in the world is parents who live by and teach Bible doctrine
to their children. They didn’t leave him any money, property, or anything
pleasant, but yet they gave him the very spark of what was worthwhile, Bible
doctrine. “They are the joy of my heart” refers to him pulling memories from
his soul’s frame of reference. His conscience had Bible doctrine as the top
priority. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I have inherited Your testimonies forever, For they are
the joy of my heart.&quot;  (Psalms 119:111, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:112, “I have inclined” is <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>נטה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(nâṭâh) and means he has doubled every
effort to make a sprint for the tape in the 10-mile run. It means to kick
through, to give all that you have in that moment, to give everything you have
in the clutch and pull through. “To perform Your statutes Forever” refers to
maximum use of Bible doctrine in the soul’s frame of reference, conscience, and
viewpoint. “Even to the end” means he was going to give out the Word until he
died, no matter what happened. He was saying; “As long as I live, Bible
doctrine is going to be the focus of my life.” Bible doctrine endures forever.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I have inclined my heart to perform Your statutes
Forever, even to the end.&quot;  (Psalms 119:112, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Samekh File - The Lever of God’s Plan</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Samekh is the Hebrew letter for a fulcrum. The samekh
file illustrates how the fulcrum of God’s Word lifts, through His plan, the
sufferings, pressures, disasters, difficulties, and details of life. If you
have no fulcrum of Bible doctrine in your soul, the lever of God’s plan can’t
do you any good.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:113, “I hate those who are double-minded”
means he hates those who are in doubt. It is an idiom for having confidence. He
<span lang=EL>ςα</span>s in a horrible situation. The wicked had the
ascendancy. “But I love Your law” means he kept on having confidence because he
loved God's Word. He loved Bible doctrine because he knew it was always his
confidence.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Samekh. I hate those who are double-minded, But I love
Your law.&quot;  (Psalms 119:113, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:114, “my hiding place” is the place where
he can retreat, a place where he can relax in the Word. “My shield” is his
protector. Since he loved the Word, he used the Word as his shield.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;You are my hiding place and my shield; I wait for Your
word.&quot;  (Psalms 119:114, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“I wait for Your word” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>יחל</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(yâchal) and means to use faith in a situation where
there is total confusion and disaster. It means to have a strong faith and thus
to be able to concentrate on the promises of God, the Word of God, the plan of
God and stay out of emotional revolt.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:115, “Depart from me evildoers” is a
technical term used of a believer in emotional revolt. He gave a command to
separate from believers who were in panic mode, screaming and falling apart. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Depart from me, evildoers, That I may observe the
commandments of my God.&quot;  (Psalms 119:115, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“That I may observe the commandments of my God” means he
won’t go back on the Word. He will keep the commandments of God. The evildoer
is the type of Christian company you get just before time to go to Bible class
or church services. So you stay home from Bible class and visit with them. Believers
are commanded to assemble together for Bible class for the intake of the Word. Heb.
10:25.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the
habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more as you see the day
drawing near.&quot;  (Hebrews 10:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:116, “Sustain me” is the qal infinitive of <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>סמך</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(sâmak) and means to support, to lean on,
to uphold.  It is God’s plan to uphold him. He had the lever of God’s plan, not
a crutch. There is a great deal of difference between a crutch and a lever. A
crutch is sublimation and  dependance on the details of life. The Word is not a
crutch. He was praying for God to sustain him so he would not be confused or
ashamed even for a second.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Sustain me according to Your word, that I may live; And
do not let me be ashamed of my hope.&quot;  (Psalms 119:116, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:117, “Uphold me” is actually “refresh me.”
It is also support in the sense of refreshment. “That I may be safe” means
literally to be delivered. This does not mean to be removed from disaster, but
to be refreshed with your inner soul freedom even in the midst of disaster. “That
I may have regard” means to concentrate on something. “Your statutes” refers to
his concentration on the categorical Bible doctrine in his soul and he wwould
do it continually.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Uphold me that I may be safe, That I may have regard for
Your statutes continually.&quot;  (Psalms 119:117, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:118, “You have rejected” means to carry
away and refers to the fifth cycle of discipline. They had erred by wandering
away from categorical Bible doctrine. Because they wandered away from doctrine,
they had gone into slavery. “Their deceitfulness” means intrigue, conspiracy
against teachers of categorical doctrine, against the Word of truth.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;You have rejected all those who wander from Your
statutes, For their deceitfulness is useless.&quot;  (Psalms 119:118, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:119, “You have removed all the wicked of
the earth” refers to the land of Judah, the ones who have rejected Bible
doctrine, those who depended upon the details of life. “Like dross” means that
God had purified the people bringing out those who are true to the Word, the
faithful remnant of believers. “Therefore, I love Your testimonies” are the
testimonies of Bible doctrine in the Old Testament through the Levitical
Offerings which all refer to the salvation work of Jesus Christ on the Cross. Gen.
3:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;You have removed all the wicked of the earth like dross;
Therefore I love Your testimonies.&quot;  (Psalms 119:119, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And I will put enmity Between you and the woman, And
between your seed and her seed; He shall bruise you on the head, And you shall
bruise him on the heel.&quot;&quot;  (Genesis 3:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:120, “My flesh trembles for fear of You”
means he was occupied with Christ. “I am afraid of Your judgments” means he
understood what the Lord does to a nation that forgets the Lord. Lev. 26:27-46;
Deut. 28:49-67.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;My flesh trembles for fear of You, And I am afraid of
Your judgments.&quot;  (Psalms 119:120, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Ayin File - Perspective From the Application of Bible
Doctrine</b> </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew letter Ayin stresses perspective and
application. He saw the difficulties of life and what he saw by application he
matched up with what he knew. Doctrine in the right lobe was looking out at the
situations of life even while under severe suffering at the time. The “eyes” of
his soul looked at life through the lens of Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:121, “I have done” is <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>עָשָׂה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(asah) and means to make something out of
something. The first something is doctrine, the second something is ability to
cope with disaster. Out of doctrine has come application to judgment and
justice. He realized the judgment of God through the fifth cycle of discipline
had resulted in justice that removed those that opposed God and His Word,
abolishment of the idols, and so on. He was able also to maintain his integrity
before God on these things. “Do not leave me to my oppressors” means to let him
live that he may go on to do marvelous things.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Ayin. I have done justice and righteousness; Do not leave
me to my oppressors.&quot;  (Psalms 119:121, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:122, “Be surety for Your servant” means to
be my security and my pledge. He was out of the land. He wanted the Lord to
promise to get him back into the land someday. “For good” refers to divine
good, so that the plan of God can go on for Israel in the land.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Be surety for Your servant for good; Do not let the
arrogant oppress me.&quot;  (Psalms 119:122, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Do not let the arrogant oppress me” means to keep him
away from the legalists. These are the taboo people, the human good people, the
holiness group, the kooks. The human good man always oppresses the grace man.
Churches have pastors to protect the sheep from the bullying of legalism. You
have the right to live your own life as unto the Lord.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:123, “My eyes fail with longing for Your
salvation” means he was saying that he knows at this point that he was going to
live through this. He had a good healthy perspective, not, “I wish I were
dead.” “And for Your righteous word” refers to the surety of knowing Bible
doctrine. He knew Bible doctrine would propel him along. It was his life. He
clung to the promises and doctrines of God.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;My eyes fail with longing for Your salvation And for Your
righteous word.&quot;  (Psalms 119:123, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:124, “Deal with Your servant” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>עָשָׂה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(asah) and means to make something out of
something. God takes you, adds Bible doctrine to your soul, and manufactures
something out of you by means of grace resulting in a life of spiritual
production and usefulness.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Deal with Your servant according to Your lovingkindness
And teach me Your statutes.&quot;  (Psalms 119:124, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s grace provides everything you need to mature
spiritually and be productive in the plan of God. “Teach” is the piel
imperative of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>למד</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(lâmad) and means to
learn Bible doctrine out of Bible class by being kicked around by training and
by discipline. This is learning doctrine the hard way.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:125, “I am Your servant” means he belonged
to God and was God's property. He was relaxed by thinking the battle is the
Lord’s. “Give me understanding” is the hiphil imperative of <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>בּין</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(bı̂yn) and means to cause to understand.
Because he belonged to the Lord, he didn’t want to do anything stupid. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I am Your servant; give me understanding, That I may know
Your testimonies.&quot;  (Psalms 119:125, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He wanted God to cause him to understand Bible doctrine
academically. This is the same meaning as <span lang=EL>γνώσις</span> (gnosis)
in the Greek. This is Bible doctrine understood academically, but not yet
believed and transferred by the Holy Spirit to the right lobe of the soul. He
realized that for the rest of his life he must learn Bible doctrine. This is
the key to everything.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“That I may know” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>ידע</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(yâda‛) and means to have believed Bible doctrine in
the right lobe of the soul. This is the same meaning as <span lang=EL>επίγνωσις</span>
(epignosis) in the Greek. It is having Bible doctrine in those shelves of the
edification complex of the soul ready for application. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:126, “It is time for the Lord to act” means
he knew that it was time for him to stop hustling and let the Lord do the heavy
lifting. The Lord must be able to work through the believer with Bible doctrine
in their soul. The horse and the ox can’t plow together unless they pull
together. The Lord can work as soon as you understand the grace principles and
get on daily intake of Bible doctrine. “To act” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>עָשָׂה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(asah) again. The Lord makes use of the
positive believer in fellowship with Bible doctrine in their soul. “Have broken
Your law” refers to those with negative volition who ignore Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;It is time for the LORD to act, For they have broken Your
law.&quot;  (Psalms 119:126, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:127, “Therefore I love Your commandments above
gold” refers to his perspective regarding Bible doctrine. He valued it far
above gold and was the priority of his life. It is the basis for handling the
details of life. “Above fine gold” is refined gold in all its beauty and
purity.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore I love Your commandments Above gold, yes, above
fine gold.&quot;  (Psalms 119:127, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:128, “Therefore I esteem right” was his
perspective of looking at life through the lens of Bible doctrine. This is
divine viewpoint. They are fantastic, absolute norms and standards. He esteemed
it all as absolutely correct. Doctrine is the measuring stick for everything in
life. “All Your precepts” refers to Bible doctrine in all its categories. This
is knowing the whole counsel of the Word of God. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore I esteem right all Your precepts concerning
everything, I hate every false way.&quot;  (Psalms 119:128, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“I hate every false way” means he despised all forms of
false doctrine. Today, we see false methods of spirituality in cults, tongues,
neo-orthodoxy, neo-evangelism, etc. How did he get that way? He learned the
Word of God. He had a full prospective of the plan of God from the Word of God.
Bible doctrine will whip, beat up, and neutralize every false doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Pe File - The Mouth of God, His Word</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew letter Pe represents a mouth. Here, it
represents the mouth of God whereby He speaks to us through His written Word
communicated to us through the pastor-teacher. This is speaking to the
individual under pressure circumstances. He in turn communicates to others.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:129, “Your testimonies” refers to Old
Testament doctrine regarding the person of Jesus Christ as well as His work on
the Cross. Jesus Christ is revealed by the titles of God in the Old Testament.
Jehovah refers to Jesus Christ more than it does to God the Father, such as in
Genesis 15:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Pe. Your testimonies are wonderful; Therefore my soul
observes them.&quot;  (Psalms 119:129, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then he believed in the LORD; and He reckoned it to him
as righteousness.&quot;  (Genesis 15:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Are wonderful” means that they sustained him mentally
with a relaxed mental attitude. They sustained his soul and kept him out of
emotional revolt. “Therefore my soul observes them” means that Bible doctrine
in the right lobe of the soul guards the soul. This gives spiritual alertness
and discernment for impact living.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is revealed by historical and prophetical
passages as well. Isaiah 7:14 reveals the Virgin Birth. Isaiah 9:6-8 and Isaiah
58 present Jesus Christ from the time of His virgin birth to the Second Advent.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign:
Behold, a virgin will be with child and bear a son, and she will call His name
Immanuel.&quot;  (Isaiah 7:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to
us; And the government will rest on His shoulders; And His name will be called
Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace. There will be
no end to the increase of His government or of peace, On the throne of David
and over his kingdom, To establish it and to uphold it with justice and
righteousness From then on and forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will
accomplish this. The Lord sends a message against Jacob, And it falls on
Israel.&quot;  (Isaiah 9:6-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is revealed by Christophanies, primarily the
Angel of Jehovah. Sometimes He appeared in the form of a man. In this way, He
appeared in the tent of Abram and wrestled with Jacob. Jesus Christ was also
revealed as the Shekinah Glory in the tabernacle and in the temple. Jesus
Christ was revealed through inanimate manifestations such as the burning bush,
the articles of furniture, and the structure of the tabernacle. See category on
<a href="#_Theophanies_of_Jesus">Theophanies of Jesus Christ</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:130, “The unfolding of Your words gives
light” refers to the grace apparatus for perception. “Gives light” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>בּין</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(bı̂yn) and refers to <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the soul. “Light” is illumination and
animation. This is the reflected glory of the edification complex of the soul.
We reflect the glory of God.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The unfolding of Your words gives light; It gives
understanding to the simple.&quot;  (Psalms 119:130, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“It gives understanding to the simple” is a very strong
statement and means stupid. This refers to any believer minus a spiritual IQ or
lacking any Bible doctrine in the right lobe of their soul. Spiritual IQ is not
dependent on human IQ. It depends only on the enabling power of the Holy Spirit
that makes the grace apparatus for perception operational. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:131, “I opened my mouth wide and panted”
refers to the desire for air. This is the intake and application of Bible doctrine
– a crash programing in taking in Bible doctrine and living in the Word.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I opened my mouth wide and panted, For I longed for Your
commandments.&quot;  (Psalms 119:131, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“For I longed for Your commandments” means he had a
tremendous desire for Bible doctrine, an insatiable desire, a desire that
excluded anything else in life. This is like the desire that you have for your
right man or right woman. This is a concentration principle. This verse
expresses maximum positive volition towards Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:132, “Turn to me and be gracious to me”
means literally, “turn me on.” Give me a love for Bible doctrine. He was asking
for the Lord to grace him out.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Turn to me and be gracious to me, After Your manner with
those who love Your name.&quot;  (Psalms 119:132, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“After Your manner with those who love Your name” means
that he understood that it was fair for God to provide grace on the 17th day of
the march because God is the God of grace. He was appealing to the essence of
God. There is no magic formula here. Billions of years ago in Eternity Past,
God provided in His decrees for every need you will ever have. “Love” here is
rapport love, returning his love, the capacity to love God. God is free to love
believers because of the Cross.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:133, “Establish my footsteps in Your word”
means to stabilize his steps, give him the strength to get up and walk today.
Give his steps strength. Firm up his steps so he can walk. Why? He was the
communicator of Bible doctrine in the slave line. The fact that he got up and
moved is a testimony to his Bible class. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Establish my footsteps in Your word, And do not let any
iniquity have dominion over me.&quot;  (Psalms 119:133, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“And do not let any iniquity have dominion over me” means
to not let his old sin nature have dominion over him. He may get out of
fellowship and get mad and punch someone in the nose. Have you ever been so mad
you would fight anyone anywhere anytime? He could try to whip the whole
Chaldean army or communicate Bible doctrine. “Do not let the emptiness of the old
sin nature dominate me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:134, “Redeem me from the oppression of man”
means he was not praying to get out of the chain gang. He was praying to be
delivered out of the danger that comes with oppression and the mental attitude
sins that could eliminate his ministry like hatred and bitterness. “That I may
keep Your precepts” means to apply categorical Bible doctrine to life’s
situations and problems. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Redeem me from the oppression of man, That I may keep
Your precepts.&quot;  (Psalms 119:134, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:135, “Make Your face shine upon Your
servant” refers to the blessings of God's grace being transferred to him. He
wanted to see what God's plan had for him to do every day of his life. “And
teach me Your statutes” means he wanted to learn Bible doctrine so he could
communicate it to the other prisoners.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Make Your face shine upon Your servant, And teach me Your
statutes.&quot;  (Psalms 119:135, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:136, “My eyes shed streams of water” means
he was not crying because of his torture and pain even though he was really
abused on this day. He was primarily crying because of negative volition of
those around him. “Because they do not keep Your law” refers to the greatest
problem the communicator of Bible doctrine can face – negative volition.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;My eyes shed streams of water, Because they do not keep
Your law.&quot;  (Psalms 119:136, NASB)</p>
