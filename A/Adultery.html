<h2><a name="_D-Adultery"></a><a name="_Adultery"></a>Adultery </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Adultery refers to sexual relations with other partners
while married. The Word of God prohibits adultery. Exodus 20:14; Deut. 5:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>““You shall not commit adultery.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Exodus 20:14,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“‘You shall not commit adultery.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Deuteronomy 5:18,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ephesians 4:19, “greediness” is <span lang=EL>πλεονεξι</span>́<span
lang=EL>α</span> (pleonexia) in the Greek means insatiable desire and refers to
believers building scar tissue through adultery. </p>

<p class=Verses>“and they, having become callous, have given themselves over to
sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians
4:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Fornication referred to sexual relations in the heathen
temples making the sex act a form of religion. Fornication is said to “wage war
against the soul” in 1 Peter 2:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Beloved, I urge you as aliens and strangers to abstain from
fleshly lusts which wage war against the soul.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Peter 2:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Marriage protects the human race from self-destruction as
a Divine Institution. That is why God's divine discipline for adultery is so
severe. Prov. 3:12; Heb. 12:6. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For whom the LORD loves He reproves, Even as a father corrects
the son in whom he delights.” (Proverbs 3:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“FOR THOSE WHOM THE LORD LOVES HE DISCIPLINES, AND HE SCOURGES
EVERY SON WHOM HE RECEIVES.&quot;” (Hebrews 12:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Adultery is a destroyer of the soul. Prov. 6:32.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The one who commits adultery with a woman is lacking sense; He
who would destroy himself does it.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 6:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sexual love (<i>eros</i>) is sanctioned only in marriage.
1 Thess. 4:3; Heb. 13:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this is the will of God, your sanctification; that is,
that you abstain from sexual immorality;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Thessalonians 4:3,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Marriage is to be held in honor among all, and the marriage
bed is to be undefiled; for fornicators and adulterers God will judge.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews
13:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Adultery has an adverse effect on the body. Repercussions
of the soul extends into the body. 1 Cor. 6:13-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Food is for the stomach and the stomach is for food, but God
will do away with both of them. Yet the body is not for immorality, but for the
Lord, and the Lord is for the body. Now God has not only raised the Lord, but
will also raise us up through His power. Do you not know that your bodies are
members of Christ? Shall I then take away the members of Christ and make them
members of a prostitute? May it never be! Or do you not know that the one who
joins himself to a prostitute is one body with her? For He says, “THE TWO SHALL
BECOME ONE FLESH.” But the one who joins himself to the Lord is one spirit with
Him. Flee immorality. Every other sin that a man commits is outside the body,
but the immoral man sins against his own body.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians
6:13-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Adultery results is sex frustration and a frantic
scramble for sexual experience. This can cause nymphomania, frigidity, etc.
However, the principle goes beyond adultery – into mental attitude sins. When a
husband seeks to respond to a woman other than his wife in adultery, the
husband destroys his soul. It also results in very damaging long-term
consequences outside of the marriage. By application, this principle also
applies to the wife. Prov. 6:32.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The one who commits adultery with a woman is lacking sense; He
who would destroy himself does it.” (Proverbs 6:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 6:32, “destroy” is a term for putting scar
tissue on the soul that effects the self-consciousness, mentality, volition,
emotion and conscience of the soul. Scar tissue twists, distorts, perverts, and
wrecks the soul and any chance for happiness within the marriage relationship.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Destroying the soul is also spelled out in Romans 1:26-27
and Romans 1:32 regarding sexual perversions such as homosexuality and
lesbianism. Ephesians 4:19 talks about being without feeling. This is a
callousness or scar tissue on the soul.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions; for
their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural, and in
the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and
burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent
acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error.”
(Romans 1:26-27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and although they know the ordinance of God, that those who
practice such things are worthy of death, they not only do the same, but also
give hearty approval to those who practice them.” (Romans 1:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and they, having become callous, have given themselves over to
sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness.”
(Ephesians 4:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scar tissue on the soul leads to a frantic search for
happiness in all the details of life. For the believer minus Bible doctrine,
the details of life compound their misery. There is no capacity for happiness
of love apart from Bible doctrine in the soul. Therefore, believers with scar
tissue are left with frustrated desires and insatiable lusts. Mental attitude
sins continue to result in self-induced misery. Scar tissue is only removed by
intake and application of Bible doctrine and the buildup of the edification
complex of the soul. Therefore, to remove scar tissue means a crash program of
intake of Bible doctrine. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>David Teaching His Son Solomon about Adultery</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 7:1-5, David is teaching his son Solomon with
a warning about the evils of an adulteress called the “foreigner.” </p>

<p class=Verses>“My son, keep my words And treasure my commandments within you.
Keep my commandments and live, And my teaching as the apple of your eye. Bind
them on your fingers; Write them on the tablet of your heart. Say to wisdom, “You
are my sister,” And call understanding your intimate friend; That they may keep
you from an adulteress, From the foreigner who flatters with her words.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs
7:1-5, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>She is a married woman out on the street as a prostitute.
Prov. 7:16-19.</p>

<p class=Verses>““I have spread my couch with coverings, With colored linens of
Egypt. “I have sprinkled my bed With myrrh, aloes and cinnamon. “Come, let us
drink our fill of love until morning; Let us delight ourselves with caresses. “For
my husband is not at home, He has gone on a long journey;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs
7:16-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>She uses seductive and persuasive flattery to seduce and
makes the prospect of sex very attractive. However, the end result of following
her is destruction.  Prov. 7:21-27.</p>

<p class=Verses>“With her many persuasions she entices him; With her flattering
lips she seduces him. Suddenly he follows her As an ox goes to the slaughter,
Or as one in fetters to the discipline of a fool, Until an arrow pierces
through his liver; As a bird hastens to the snare, So he does not know that it
will cost him his life. Now therefore, my sons, listen to me, And pay attention
to the words of my mouth. Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways, Do not
stray into her paths. For many are the victims she has cast down, And numerous
are all her slain. Her house is the way to Sheol, Descending to the chambers of
death.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 7:21-27, NASB)</p>
