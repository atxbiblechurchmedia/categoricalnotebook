<h2>Angelic Conflict, The Session of Jesus Christ</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The resurrected Jesus Christ is now seated at the right
hand of God the Father in the third heaven. He is in session in the place of
honor in the throne room of God. He will remain there until the Rapture of the
Church. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 1:13-14, “to which of the angels has He ever
said,” means that no angel has ever been asked by God the Father to sit in the
place of highest honor, His right hand. “Sit” is the present active imperative
of <span lang=EL>κάθημαι</span> (kathēmai) and refers to Jesus Christ and
means You, Jesus Christ sit down and keep on sitting. “At My right hand” is the
place of highest honor. “Until I make” is the aorist tense, at a point of time,
at the Second Advent. “Your enemies” refers to the fallen angels of Matthew
5:35. “A footstool for your feet” is an idiom for conquest.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But to which of the angels has He ever said, &quot;SIT AT
MY RIGHT HAND, UNTIL I MAKE YOUR ENEMIES A FOOTSTOOL FOR YOUR FEET&quot;? Are
they not all ministering spirits, sent out to render service for the sake of
those who will inherit salvation?&quot;  (Hebrews 1:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;or by the earth, for it is the footstool of His feet, or
by Jerusalem, for it is THE CITY OF THE GREAT KING.&quot;  (Matthew 5:35, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>No humanity was in heaven before the humanity of Jesus
Christ. John 3:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>““No one has ascended into heaven, but He who descended from
heaven: the Son of Man.”  (John 3:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The issue was the acceptability of the resurrected
humanity of Christ in hypostatic union to God the Father. The Lord Jesus Christ
has the exact same divine essence as the other two members of the Trinity. His
deity holds the universe together with the word of His power while His humanity
was paying the penalty for all of our sins on the Cross.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Father accepted Jesus Christ because Jesus
Christ’s humanity had the exact same absolute righteousness (+R). Therefore,
God the Father told the resurrected Jesus Christ to sit at His right hand - the
place of honor. Heb. 1:13; Heb. 12:1-2; Heb. 1:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But to which of the angels has He ever said, “SIT AT MY RIGHT
HAND, UNTIL I MAKE YOUR ENEMIES A FOOTSTOOL FOR YOUR FEET”?”  (Hebrews 1:13,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses
surrounding us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so
easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before
us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the
joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at
the right hand of the throne of God.”  (Hebrews 12:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He is the radiance of His glory and the exact
representation of His nature, and upholds all things by the word of His power.
When He had made purification of sins, He sat down at the right hand of the
Majesty on high,”  (Hebrews 1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>His acceptability indicated the completion of Christ’s
work of salvation during His incarnation. Heb. 10:11-12. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Every priest stands daily ministering and offering time after
time the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins; but He, having
offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, SAT DOWN AT THE RIGHT HAND OF
GOD,”  (Hebrews 10:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>His acceptability indicated that humanity of Jesus Christ
in hypostatic union had satisfied the righteousness of God the Father. Perfect
and absolute righteousness (+R) demanded equally perfect and absolute
righteousness. Rom. 3:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,” 
(Romans 3:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>His acceptability indicated that the work of Jesus Christ
satisfied the justice of God the Father. Justice demanded a penalty for sin.
Rom. 6:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is
eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.”  (Romans 6:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The acceptance of the Lord Jesus Christ in hypostatic
union meant the acceptance of His sacrifice. The acceptance of His sacrifice
meant the acceptance of all those who seek entrance to the presence of the
Father through faith in Jesus Christ. Through His redemptive work, His
ascension and session, the Lord Jesus Christ accomplished bringing many sons
into glory. Heb. 2:9-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But we do see Him who was made for a little while lower than
the angels, namely, Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory
and honor, so that by the grace of God He might taste death for everyone. For
it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things, and through whom are all
things, in bringing many sons to glory, to perfect the author of their
salvation through sufferings.”  (Hebrews 2:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Because the God-man was accepted, every believer is also
accepted by the Father. Eph. 1:6. </p>

<p class=Verses>“to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely
bestowed on us in the Beloved.”  (Ephesians 1:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Because the God-man is seated, every believer is seated
positionally, at the right hand of the Father. Eph. 2:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and raised us up with Him, and seated us with Him in the
heavenly places in Christ Jesus,”  (Ephesians 2:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The humanity of Jesus Christ is glorified above all
angels. Every believer is positionally higher than angels so each believer has
a guardian angel. Heb. 1:13-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But to which of the angels has He ever said, “SIT AT MY RIGHT
HAND, UNTIL I MAKE YOUR ENEMIES A FOOTSTOOL FOR YOUR FEET”? Are they not all
ministering spirits, sent out to render service for the sake of those who will
inherit salvation?”  (Hebrews 1:13-14, NASB)</p>
