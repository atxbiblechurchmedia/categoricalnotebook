<h2>Blind Arrogance</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God's standards for maturity and qualification for
blessing are the same for every believer. These standards are often difficult
for most believers to accept. These standards are absolute and fair. They are
not based on emotions or the arrogance of legalism. They are perfect standards
based on the perfect essence of God. It is blind arrogance for any Christian to
assume that they have received what no other believer has or that they have
some special experience, or that their life is more important than any other
believer’s life. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Signs of Blind Arrogance</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The sin of blind arrogance comes in many forms. While the
spiritually maturing believer will observe these signs of blind arrogance in
others, those under blind arrogance never seem to know they are blind to their
own carnal activity. This is only one of the many reasons for God’s mandate for
consistent daily intake and application of the Word of God. The filling of the
Spirit keeps the believer from arrogance and under God’s plan for their lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Legalism is a manifestation of blind arrogance. The three
main categories of legalism can be seen as salvation by works, spirituality by
works, and spiritual maturity by works. Emotional arrogance can be blind
arrogance. This is exhibited by the Charismatics (Pentecostals) who associate
spiritual advance with the temporary spiritual gift of tongues that became
non-functional in 70 AD. Self-centered arrogance is also a sign of blind
arrogance. Here, believers assume their lives, activities, or options are more
important than those of anyone else. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is blind arrogance to assume that the plan of God
stands or falls on the basis of your behavior. Another manifestation of blind
arrogance is the belief that the plan of God stands on any other believer. It
is blind arrogance for a person to establish standards contrary to the Word of
God and to then comply with those standards. In so doing, they often assume
they are a great believer. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Another sign of blind arrogance is the assumption that
any type of kindness or friendliness from the opposite sex means that person is
madly in love with you. It is blind arrogance to assume that a few dates mean a
declaration of love or a silent agreement to marriage. It is blind arrogance to
attempt to superimpose your enthusiasm on others who are not interested and to
judge them falsely with harsh criticism for not sharing your enthusiasm. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Illustrations of Blind Arrogance</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 19:30, the first who are really last, are
Christians guilty of blind arrogance. They are last for blessing in time and
last for reward in eternity. The last who are really first are those believers
with maximum Bible doctrine in their souls. These believers have great humility
and grace orientation. They are moving toward spiritual maturity and will enjoy
blessing in time and rewards in eternity. Therefore, the first who are guilty
of blind arrogance live most of their lives under the influence of Satan's
world system of evil. The last who are really first are those Christians who
live most of their lives under the influence of <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine
in the right lobe of their souls. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;But many who are first will be last; and the last,
first.&quot;  (Matthew 19:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Labor union workers are illustrated in Matthew 20:1-6.
They have bargained with the land owner for a day's wages and they have a union
contract for that day. Therefore, they were under contract to management. The
land owner (capitalist) needed more labor, so he went out and hired non-union
labor. Why? Management invests the money and makes the policies. Labor does not
dictate to management under divine establishment principles. It was the policy
of this capitalist (land owner) to hire all the non-union labor he could find
and to treat them right. Under the Laws of Divine Establishment, capitalists
(those who put up the money) and management have the sole right to make policy
for their business. Neither government nor labor has any right to make policy
under free enterprise nor to dictate policy to business. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who
went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard. &quot;When he
had agreed with the laborers for a denarius for the day, he sent them into his
vineyard. &quot;And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing
idle in the market place; and to those he said, 'You also go into the vineyard,
and whatever is right I will give you.' And so they went. &quot;Again he went
out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did the same thing. &quot;And about
the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing around; and he said to
them, 'Why have you been standing here idle all day long?'&quot;  (Matthew
20:1-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Note that the non-union labor did not bargain with
management, but left it up to the discretion of management as to what they
should receive for that day's work or part of a day’s work. The spiritual
application here involves the understanding that the actions of the labor
unions in this example are like those of a legalistic and blindly arrogant
believer. In this example, the actions of non-union labor are like those of a
grace-orientated believer operating with genuine grace humility. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Influence of Satan’s World System of Evil</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Rewards for believers in eternity depend on the policy of
God, not the arrogant, legalistic, and man-centered standards of the evil world
that surrounds us and blind fundamentalism. God does not bless the believer in
time nor reward the believer in eternity on the basis of the arrogant standards
of evil. Arrogance is always critical of grace. When arrogance becomes critical
of grace, it is under the evil of Satan's world system. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The “first” are those under the influence of the world
system of evil and have blind arrogance. The “last” are those under the
influence of maximum Bible doctrine in the soul. They have true grace
orientation to life. Therefore, they have true humility. The “last” are those
spiritually mature Christians who avoided the influence of the world and its
evil schemes in their lives. They will be “first” in heaven which means they
will be first in blessings and rewards. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Blind Arrogance Within Families</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>People can be predisposed to blind arrogance from
observing and learning from their parents’ teaching and actions. For example,
in Matthew 20:20-21, the mother of the sons of Zebedee (the apostles James and
John) suggested to Jesus Christ that her sons be seated on His right and left
in His kingdom. These apostles and their mother Salome were arrogant at this
point and very legalistic. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to Jesus with
her sons, bowing down and making a request of Him. And He said to her,
&quot;What do you wish?&quot; She said to Him, &quot;Command that in Your
kingdom these two sons of mine may sit one on Your right and one on Your
left.&quot;&quot;  (Matthew 20:20-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The baptism of the cup is the Cross where Jesus Christ
was going to provide salvation. Neither James nor John could provide salvation
on the Cross. They could not die for the sins of the world. If man can do
anything to provide salvation, then there is no salvation. Man can only
appropriate salvation by faith in Christ. Man cannot provide salvation by being
judged on the Cross. Only the God-man Jesus Christ was qualified to do that and
He was absolutely unique. Only a perfect man can provide salvation on the
Cross, hence the impeccability of our Lord Jesus Christ. Blind arrogance is a
combination of the sin of pride plus evil thinking. Evil thinking from the
world around you is any thought pattern contrary to grace, the Laws of Divine
Establishment, and Bible doctrine. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Mob Action </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mobs cannot think, cannot reason, cannot accomplish
anything worthwhile in life. Mobs are the historical illustration of mass blind
arrogance. Mobs are the opposite of the Laws of Divine Establishment, by which
we have our freedom. Mobs destroy freedom, privacy, property, and hinder
spiritual growth. Mobs are anti-authority, anti-discipline, anti-establishment,
and anti-revivals. You cannot have mobs and have any kind of revival. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The mob of Matthew 20:29 was typical. It was a case of
people sticking their noses into someone else's business - a typical violation
of freedom and the privacy of the two blind men. The doctrine of the long nose
is a hindrance to spiritual growth. Nosy people who invade our privacy are
retrogressive, influenced by evil, and guilty of blind arrogance. This mob was
guilty of blind arrogance. The two blind men had not gained the approval of the
mob and that speaks well of them. The mob was very antagonistic. If the
judgment of the mob had prevailed, these two blind men would have been ignored.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;As they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed
Him.&quot;  (Matthew 20:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Following Christ Frees You from Blind Arrogance</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To follow Christ originally is to believe in Him for
salvation. To follow Christ as a Christian is to be faithful in the daily study
of the Word of God. There is only one way to follow Christ after regeneration
and that is to be consistent in the intake of Bible doctrine, day by day. Once
the Christian matures spiritually, they are free from the influence of Satan’s
world system of evil, which means they are free from blind arrogance. The
mature believer fulfills the phrase which appears twice in the context of
Matthew 19:27 through Matthew 20:34. The phrase is “The last shall be first”
means first in the sense of blessing in their spiritual life and reward in
eternity. The mature believer is first for blessing in their spiritual life and
first for rewards in eternity. Whereas the first (as in these passages from
Matthew) is under blind arrogance. Blind arrogance means last for blessing in
their spiritual life and last for reward in eternity. And last means nothing at
all. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;And everyone who has left houses or brothers or
sisters or father or mother or children or farms for My name's sake, will
receive many times as much, and will inherit eternal life. &quot;But many who
are first will be last; and the last, first.&quot;  (Matthew 19:29-30, NASB)</p>
