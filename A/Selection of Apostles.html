<h2><a name="_Apostleship"></a><a name="_Apostleship,_Spiritual_Gift"></a>Selection
of Apostles </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Lord Jesus Christ chose who would be the 12
disciples. This selection emphasizes the divine prerogative or sovereignty of
Jesus Christ. The selection of the 12th Apostle to replace Judas was also
divine prerogative and not for believers to choose. The Lord Jesus Christ gave
them special powers to perform miracles and heal the sick. This was their
calling card so that people would listen to their message. Acts 1:2; Matt.
10:1; Mark 3:13-19; Luke 6:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“until the day when He was taken up to heaven, after He had by
the Holy Spirit given orders to the apostles whom He had chosen.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts
1:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Jesus summoned His twelve disciples and gave them authority
over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every kind of disease and
every kind of sickness.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 10:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And when day came, He called His disciples to Him and chose
twelve of them, whom He also named as apostles: Simon, whom He also named
Peter, and Andrew his brother; and James and John; and Philip and Bartholomew;
and Matthew and Thomas; James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon who was called the
Zealot; Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Luke
6:13-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The disciples at this time (still in the Age of Israel)
were appointed apostles to Israel, not to the Church. Matt. 10:5-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“These twelve Jesus sent out after instructing them: “Do not go
in the way of the Gentiles, and do not enter any city of the Samaritans; but
rather go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew
10:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Later, on the day of Pentecost when the Church Age began,
they received the spiritual gift of Apostle to the Church. Acts 2:1-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“When the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in
one place. And suddenly there came from heaven a noise like a violent rushing
wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. And there appeared
to them tongues as of fire distributing themselves, and they rested on each one
of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with
other tongues, as the Spirit was giving them utterance.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts
2:1-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Peter was not appointed an apostle to the Church in
Matthew 16:18-19. The “rock” has always been Jesus Christ and the “keys” are
the prerogative of witnessing and did not carry special authority.</p>

<p class=Verses>““I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I
will build My church; and the gates of Hades will not overpower it. “I will
give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever you bind on earth
shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall have
been loosed in heaven.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 16:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>During the ten days before the Day of Pentecost, the
eleven disciples decided to try to fill the place vacated by Judas, who
betrayed the Lord and committed suicide. Matt. 10:4; Acts 1:15-26.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, the one who betrayed
Him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 10:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The election of Mathias was a farce. Paul, not Mathias
was chosen by Jesus Christ to be the 12th apostle. This was out of line as
Jesus chose the disciples and appointed them apostles of Israel. These 11, not
Matthias whom they elected in Acts 1:26, were given the gift of Apostleship, on
the Day of Pentecost, the day the Church Age began. 1 Tim. 1:12-16. See
category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/P/Day%20of%20Pentecost.html">The Day of Pentecost</a>. See category on <a
href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/A/Apostleship%2C%20Spiritual%20Gift.html">Apostleship, Spiritual Gift</a>. </p>

<p class=Verses>“I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has strengthened me,
because He considered me faithful, putting me into service, even though I was
formerly a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent aggressor. Yet I was shown
mercy because I acted ignorantly in unbelief; and the grace of our Lord was
more than abundant, with the faith and love which are found in Christ Jesus. It
is a trustworthy statement, deserving full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came
into the world to save sinners, among whom I am foremost of all. Yet for this
reason I found mercy, so that in me as the foremost, Jesus Christ might
demonstrate His perfect patience as an example for those who would believe in
Him for eternal life.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Timothy 1:12-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A church election cannot give a person the spiritual gift
of any kind. All spiritual gifts are given at the moment of salvation by the
Holy Spirit by the sovereign will of Jesus Christ. Eph. 4:8; Eph. 4:11-12; 1
Cor. 12:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore it says, “WHEN HE ASCENDED ON HIGH, HE LED CAPTIVE A
HOST OF CAPTIVES, AND HE GAVE GIFTS TO MEN.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 4:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some
as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the
saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians
4:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But one and the same Spirit works all these things,
distributing to each one individually just as He wills.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Corinthians 12:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ, in His departure from earth made provision
for spiritual gifts including apostleship. Spiritual gifts are now distributed
by the Holy Spirit in the Church Age at the point of salvation. </p>
