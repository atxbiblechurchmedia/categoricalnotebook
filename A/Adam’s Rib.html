<h2><a name="_D-Adam’s_Rib"></a><a name="_Adam’s_Rib"></a>Adam’s Rib</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are three grace gifts from God to the human race.
They cannot be purchased. They cannot be earned. They are never deserved. They
cannot be worked for. In the first grace gift for the man, God provides the
woman for him and for the woman, God brings her to the man. The second grace
gift is for the entire human race where Jesus Christ provides the perfect grace
work of salvation on the Cross by paying the penalty of the sins of all mankind
(unlimited atonement). The third grace gift is God’s provision of the written
Canon of Scripture, the very thinking of Jesus Christ in written form and
communicated through the Holy Spirit to anyone willing to hear. 1 Cor. 2:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL
INSTRUCT HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The gift of providing the right companion is the oldest
gift in human history. Gen. 1:26-27; Gen. 5:1-2; Gen. 2:7; Gen. 2:18-25.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then God said, &quot;Let Us make man in Our image,
according to Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over
the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth, and over every
creeping thing that creeps on the earth.&quot; God created man in His own
image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created
them.&quot;  (Genesis 1:26-27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day
when God created man, He made him in the likeness of God. He created them male
and female, and He blessed them and named them Man in the day when they were
created.&quot;  (Genesis 5:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then the LORD God formed man of dust from the ground, and
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living
being.&quot;  (Genesis 2:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then the LORD God said, &quot;It is not good for the man
to be alone; I will make him a helper suitable for him.&quot;&quot;  (Genesis
2:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When man was created, Jesus Christ said, “It is not good
for the man to be alone.” Therefore, in grace Jesus Christ built a woman for
Adam and He brought her to the man. The relationship was established from the
beginning during innocence and continued after the fall. It was designed for
maximum human happiness. Even an unbeliever whose life is a total failure and
has an otherwise miserable life, has great happiness in this grace gift from
Jesus Christ. Eccl. 9:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Enjoy life with the woman whom you love all the days of
your fleeting life which He has given to you under the sun; for this is your
reward in life and in your toil in which you have labored under the sun.&quot; 
(Ecclesiastes 9:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The greatest attack on this grace gift and this divine
law comes from the soul in the form of negative volition. Negative volition
results in carnality due to emotional revolt in the soul which in turn results
in scar tissue. Remaining in this state leads to reversionism or long-term
carnality with maximum scar tissue.  These attacks of negative volition are
accompanied by fornication and promiscuity. Jer. 31:22; Prov. 5; Eccl. 7:26-29;
1 Cor. 11:3-16; Prov. 6:20-32.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;How long will you go here and there, O faithless
daughter? For the LORD has created a new thing in the earth— A woman will
encompass a man.&quot;&quot;  (Jeremiah 31:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And I discovered more bitter than death the woman whose
heart is snares and nets, whose hands are chains. One who is pleasing to God
will escape from her, but the sinner will be captured by her. &quot;Behold, I
have discovered this,&quot; says the Preacher, &quot;adding one thing to
another to find an explanation, which I am still seeking but have not found. I
have found one man among a thousand, but I have not found a woman among all
these. &quot;Behold, I have found only this, that God made men upright, but
they have sought out many devices.&quot;&quot;  (Ecclesiastes 7:26-29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Perversions of the divinely ordained relationship between
a man and his woman include autoerotism where the person responds to self,
homosexuality and lesbianism where the person responds to the same sex, (Lev.
18:22; Rom. 1:26-27), adultery (fornication) where the person responds to the
wrong man or wrong woman apart from marriage (Exodus 20:14; Prov. 5:20; Prov.
6:32), and ultimately bestiality (Lev. 18:23) where the person responds to
animals.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;'You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female;
it is an abomination.&quot;  (Leviticus 18:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions;
for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural, and
in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and
burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent
acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error.&quot; 
(Romans 1:26-27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;You shall not commit adultery.&quot;  (Exodus
20:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For why should you, my son, be exhilarated with an
adulteress And embrace the bosom of a foreigner?&quot;  (Proverbs 5:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The one who commits adultery with a woman is lacking
sense; He who would destroy himself does it.&quot;  (Proverbs 6:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;'Also you shall not have intercourse with any animal to
be defiled with it, nor shall any woman stand before an animal to mate with it;
it is a perversion.&quot;  (Leviticus 18:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mental attitude sins are also destructive to the divinely
ordained man-woman relationship. Jealousy is the best illustration. Son. 8:6-7;
Prov. 27:4; Prov. 6:34.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Put me like a seal over your heart, Like a seal on
your arm. For love is as strong as death, Jealousy is as severe as Sheol; Its
flashes are flashes of fire, The very flame of the LORD. &quot;Many waters
cannot quench love, Nor will rivers overflow it; If a man were to give all the
riches of his house for love, It would be utterly despised.&quot;&quot;  (Song
of Solomon 8:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Wrath is fierce and anger is a flood, But who can stand
before jealousy?&quot;  (Proverbs 27:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For jealousy enrages a man, And he will not spare in the
day of vengeance.&quot;  (Proverbs 6:34, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Negative volition toward Bible doctrine destroys the
proper man-woman relationship. Jer. 15:15-21; Jer. 17:9-11; Jer. 12:7-9; Jer.
15:8-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;The heart is more deceitful than all else And is
desperately sick; Who can understand it? &quot;I, the LORD, search the heart, I
test the mind, Even to give to each man according to his ways, According to the
results of his deeds. &quot;As a partridge that hatches eggs which it has not
laid, So is he who makes a fortune, but unjustly; In the midst of his days it
will forsake him, And in the end he will be a fool.&quot;&quot;  (Jeremiah
17:9-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;I have forsaken My house, I have abandoned My
inheritance; I have given the beloved of My soul Into the hand of her enemies.
&quot;My inheritance has become to Me Like a lion in the forest; She has roared
against Me; Therefore I have come to hate her. &quot;Is My inheritance like a
speckled bird of prey to Me? Are the birds of prey against her on every side?
Go, gather all the beasts of the field, Bring them to devour!&quot;  (Jeremiah
12:7-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Their widows will be more numerous before Me Than
the sand of the seas; I will bring against them, against the mother of a young
man, A destroyer at noonday; I will suddenly bring down on her Anguish and
dismay. &quot;She who bore seven sons pines away; Her breathing is labored. Her
sun has set while it was yet day; She has been shamed and humiliated. So I will
give over their survivors to the sword Before their enemies,&quot; declares the
LORD.&quot;  (Jeremiah 15:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Analogies of the Man-Woman Relationship</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Bible contains analogies to the divinely ordained
man-woman relationship. One analogy is the Lord and Israel in Jeremiah 2,
Jeremiah 3, Jeremiah 13, and Ezekiel 16:23. Another is the Lord and the Church
in Ephesians 5:26-33. A third analogy is the function of the grace apparatus
for perception in James 1:19-22.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Then it came about after all your wickedness ('Woe,
woe to you!' declares the Lord GOD),&quot;  (Ezekiel 16:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Nevertheless, each individual among you also is to love
his own wife even as himself, and the wife must see to it that she respects her
husband.&quot;  (Ephesians 5:33, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;This you know, my beloved brethren. But everyone must be
quick to hear, slow to speak and slow to anger; for the anger of man does not
achieve the righteousness of God. Therefore, putting aside all filthiness and
all that remains of wickedness, in humility receive the word implanted, which
is able to save your souls. But prove yourselves doers of the word, and not
merely hearers who delude themselves.&quot;  (James 1:19-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In marriage, the man is the shepherd and bishop of the
woman’s soul just as Jesus Christ is the shepherd and bishop of the believer’s
soul. 1 Peter 2:25; 1 Peter 3:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For you were continually straying like sheep, but now you
have returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls.&quot;  (1 Peter 2:25,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;In the same way, you wives, be submissive to your own
husbands so that even if any of them are disobedient to the word, they may be
won without a word by the behavior of their wives,&quot;  (1 Peter 3:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The woman is the glory of the man just as the believer’s
edification complex of the soul is the glory of God. 1 Cor. 11:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For a man ought not to have his head covered, since he is
the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man.&quot;  (1
Corinthians 11:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Man-Woman Relationship Related to the Laws of
Divine Establishment </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The biblically correct man-woman relationship is related
to the laws of divine establishment. Monogamy is ordained by God to remind
mankind that there is only one man for one woman in a marriage. 1 Cor. 7:2-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But because of immoralities, each man is to have his own
wife, and each woman is to have her own husband. The husband must fulfill his
duty to his wife, and likewise also the wife to her husband. The wife does not
have authority over her own body, but the husband does; and likewise also the
husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does.&quot;  (1
Corinthians 7:2-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Under the laws of divine establishment, the divinely
sanctioned man-woman relationship in marriage becomes Divine Institution No. 2,
Marriage. Marriage is the protection for the husband-wife love in marriage.
Heb. 13:4; 1 Cor. 7:9; 1 Tim. 5:14; Rom. 7:2-3; Gen. 2:24-25; Eph. 5:22; Eph.
5:25; Eph. 5:28; Eph. 5:31-33.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Marriage is to be held in honor among all, and the
marriage bed is to be undefiled; for fornicators and adulterers God will
judge.&quot;  (Hebrews 13:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore, I want younger widows to get married, bear
children, keep house, and give the enemy no occasion for reproach;&quot;  (1
Timothy 5:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For this reason a man shall leave his father and his
mother, and be joined to his wife; and they shall become one flesh. And the man
and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed.&quot;  (Genesis 2:24-25,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their
own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself;&quot;  (Ephesians 5:28,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Marriage forms the basis for stability in society and
rejects the theories of anarchy, promiscuity, and communal living. Since the
man-woman relationship was designed by God for the ultimate in human happiness,
marriage is both a protection and a boundary for the love between the husband
and wife. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Marriage is also protected by Divine Institution No. 3,
Family where the parents have responsibility for training their children for
both life and marriage. Before parents existed, they were mentioned for that
reason in Gen 2:24.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother,
and be joined to his wife; and they shall become one flesh.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis
2:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Authority in Marriage</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The husband is the authority in marriage according to
Ephesians 5:22. When the man does not follow divine mandates in marriage, God
protects the woman from tyranny. The man who has that leadership authority and
uses it in love toward his wife remembers that he was first loved and taught by
his mother. His mother taught him respect for womanhood, which keeps him from
becoming an animal. Prov. 31. See category on <a
href="#_D-Authority_Orientation">Authority Orientation</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians
5:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The divinely planned man-woman relationship must also be
related to mankind at the time of the Fall and in relationship to the Fall. God
confirmed that the authority of the husband in the marriage did not changed
after the Fall. Gen. 3:16; Eph. 5:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“To the woman He said, “I will greatly multiply Your pain in
childbirth, In pain you will bring forth children; Yet your desire will be for
your husband, And he will rule over you.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis 3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>However in the Fall, man and woman reverse their proper
roles. Adam responded to the woman in Genesis 3:6 instead of the being the
initiator. Eve was the initiator instead of the responder. Until this time at
the Fall, sex had been simply for pleasure of both the man and the woman. This
concept continued after the Fall, but something else is added to sex which was
not there before. It also became the means of perpetuation of the human race,
but in sex, this is still secondary.  The primary function of sex in marriage
has always been pleasure, happiness and delight of both the husband and the
wife.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and
that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one
wise, she took from its fruit and ate; and she gave also to her husband with
her, and he ate.&quot;  (Genesis 3:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Therefore, after the Fall, the woman bears the children
and through the woman, the Savior Jesus Christ would come into the world so
that He could go to the Cross. Gen. 3:15-16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And I will put enmity Between you and the woman, And between
your seed and her seed; He shall bruise you on the head, And you shall bruise
him on the heel.” To the woman He said, “I will greatly multiply Your pain in
childbirth, In pain you will bring forth children; Yet your desire will be for
your husband, And he will rule over you.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis 3:15-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Amplification of God’s Grace Gift in Marriage</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are two forms of misery that can cause a man a
great deal of unhappiness – a foolish son and a contentious wife. Conversely,
there are two things in life where the man is provided grace - an inheritance
from parents and a woman in marriage with Bible doctrine in her soul either
when you marry her, or after marriage. Prov. 19:13-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“A foolish son is destruction to his father, And the
contentions of a wife are a constant dripping. House and wealth are an
inheritance from fathers, But a prudent wife is from the LORD.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs
19:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 19:13-14, “prudent” is the hiphil participle
of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שָׂכַל</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(sakal) and means to
be continually caused to be wise. The wife with Bible doctrine in her soul is
from the Lord. The participle means she continually functions in divine wisdom.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>She was positive to Bible doctrine while she was single
and waiting for the man to come along with the correct soul rapport. This means
she will have a continual fantastic happiness in the marriage relationship.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 18:22, “He who finds” is the qal perfect of <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>מצא</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> (mâtsâ) and means to discover and is the soul recognition of
the man towards his woman. The Lord brought the first woman to the first man in
grace. When Adam saw the first woman he said <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>אשּׁה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>('ishshâh)! He recognized her in his
soul. Ishshah was the expression of the first soul climax in history.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He who finds a wife finds a good thing And obtains favor from
the LORD.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 18:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 18:22, “a good thing” in the Hebrew is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>טוֹב</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> (tob) and means he has identified or discovered the woman for
him.  <i>Tob</i> is the same word used in Genesis 2:18. “Obtains” is in the
hiphil imperfect of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>פּוּק</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (pûq). “Favor” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>רצון</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(râtsôn) and means grace and an object of delight.
Literally, he who has found his woman has received grace and an object of
delight from the Lord.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD God said, “It is not good for the man to be
alone; I will make him a helper suitable for him.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis 2:18,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The word “burn” in 1 Corinthians 7:9 is not a wave of
libido, but that soul climax in which every compartment of the soul’s essence
is stimulated to total concentration on what the Lord has brought. The
extension of this soul concentration on the man-woman relationship will be the
fulfillment of their marriage as God designed it to be. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But if they do not have self-control, let them marry; for it
is better to marry than to burn with passion.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 7:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 1:26, “Then God said” is the qal imperfect of <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>אמר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>('âmar) and means a pronouncement of a
decree. God held a conference between members of the Godhead. This is a part of
God's divine decrees. The topic of discussion was husband and wife. Gen. 1:26.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then God said, &quot;Let Us make man in Our image,
according to Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over
the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth, and over every
creeping thing that creeps on the earth.&quot;&quot;  (Genesis 1:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The husband-wife relationship was provided historically
before salvation. The greatest thing that God ever did for man apart from
salvation and provision for spiritual growth was provide for the right kind of
woman for the man and the right kind of man for the woman. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 1:26, “Let Us make” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>עָשָׂה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(asah). There are four Hebrew words used
for creation of the body and soul of the man and woman. They are; Asah, Barah,
Yatsar, and Banah. Asah is the personality of the man created out of the
invisible essence. Barah is the creation of the invisible essence. Yatsar is
the creation of the male body only (first). Banah is the creation of the female
body only (many years later). The soul of every human being must have a house. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Asah is used in connection with barah in connection with
the soul. Both of these are related to the soul of man and, of course, the
human spirit. Neither is related to the body.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The personality is a manifestation of the soul. So barah
is the invisible essence of your soul that includes self-consciousness,
mentality, volition, emotion, and conscience. Asah is the manifestation or the
visible part of the soul. You put all those things together and you have a
visible personality. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You all have the same essence of soul, but the
personalities differ. Your personality was manufactured (asah) out of the
essence of your soul. Asah is mentioned first because man is going to be a
personality. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God (Elohim) is used because the name refers to God the
Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit in essence. They have identical
essence. Man is one in essence also, but the difference is in personally. God
is one in essence, but three in personality.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Isaiah 43:7, “I have created (barah) for My glory” and
refers to man’s soul. It is the soul that is saved through the cross, not the
body. “Whom I have formed” is the qal perfect of <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>יצר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(yâtsar) and refers to the body of Adam. “Even whom I
have made (constructed)” is asah - his personality which is manufactured out of
the invisible essence of soul. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Everyone who is called by My name, And whom I have
created for My glory, Whom I have formed, even whom I have made.&quot;&quot; 
(Isaiah 43:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 1:26, the Hebrew word for “man” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>אדם</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>('âdâm) and refers to the human race. It
is the same as homo sapien or mankind, both male and female. Another usage of
“adam” is to add the definite article where it refers to the first Adam, the
historical Adam. Here God says, “Let us make the human race.” Let us
manufacture out of the essence of the human soul, the human race. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“In Our image” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>צלם</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>(tselem) where the preposition plus noun refers to a shadow image, to
essence. Essence is real, but invisible. If one was to cut into the human
brain, you will not find self-consciousness, mentality, volition, conscience,
etc. What you are in your soul cannot be seen, but is very real. Just as God
has invisible essence but is real, so man’s essence in the soul is invisible,
but real.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 1:26, “according to Our likeness” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>דּמוּת</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(demûth) and refers to a model or
pattern. This is referring to the personalities of man. Man’s personalities
differ just as the three personalities of the Godhead differ. Jehovah goes with
this word. Your soul has personality.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 1:27, “So God created man” (still in the
planning stage). “Created” is barah. “Man” is ha adam - the man Adam. “In His
own image” is tselem and means shadow image, essence. “Male and female created
he them” means God created Adam and the woman at different times.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;God created man in His own image, in the image of God He
created him; male and female He created them.&quot;  (Genesis 1:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Male” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>זכר</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(zâkâr) and refers
to a male having a soul in a man’s body. “Female” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>נקבה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(neqêbâh) and refers to the female body designed to
respond to the man in the husband-wife marriage relationship. Now man is alone.
You can tell this from Genesis 2:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;By the seventh day God completed His work which He had
done, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had
done.&quot;  (Genesis 2:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Then “man” in Genesis 2:7, “the man” in Genesis 2:15-16 ,
then “not good for the man to be alone” in Genesis 2:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then the LORD God formed man of dust from the ground, and
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living
being.&quot;  (Genesis 2:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then the LORD God took the man and put him into the
garden of Eden to cultivate it and keep it. The LORD God commanded the man,
saying, &quot;From any tree of the garden you may eat freely;&quot;  (Genesis
2:15-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then the LORD God said, &quot;It is not good for the man
to be alone; I will make him a helper suitable for him.&quot;&quot;  (Genesis
2:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Adam had been naming all of these animals and no woman
was around! Gen. 2:19-20.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the
field and every bird of the sky, and brought them to the man to see what he
would call them; and whatever the man called a living creature, that was its
name. The man gave names to all the cattle, and to the birds of the sky, and to
every beast of the field, but for Adam there was not found a helper suitable
for him.&quot;  (Genesis 2:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 1:27, Adam was created on day six with an
extra rib and a woman’s soul in incubation within him. At this time, the woman
did not yet exist as a separate entity. “Them” is otham in the Hebrew and means
both souls were created on day six, but only one had a body. “He created
(barah) them” both souls were created.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Account of Creation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 5:1, “generations of Adam” refers to
generations of the human race as there is no definite article. “When God
created man” is the Hebrew word barah and refers to creation of mankind – one
male and one female soul were created. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day
when God created man, He made him in the likeness of God.&quot;  (Genesis 5:1,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“He made him” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>עָשָׂה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>(asah) and means God manufactured Adam’s personality out of invisible
essence. “Him” is otho and refers to the souls of both man and woman, both on
the sixth day of creation/restoration, one was activated, one was not. “The
likeness of God” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>דּמוּת</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(demûth) and means
pattern and refers to personality. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 5:2, “male and female” is <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>זכר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(zâkâr) and <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>נקבה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(neqêbâh). This refers to the male sex and the female
sex (body, soul, spirit). “Created them” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>בָּרָא</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(bârâ') - souls created on day six, only
one body and that was for the male. “And blessed them” is the piel imperfect of
<span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>בּרך</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(bârak), and means
intensive happiness. “Male” refers to a male having a soul in a man’s body.
“Female” refers to the female body designed to respond to the man in the
husband-wife marriage relationship.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He created them male and female, and He blessed them and
named them Man in the day when they were created.&quot;  (Genesis 5:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ecclesiastes 9:9, “Enjoy life” is the qal imperative
of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>ראה</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(râ'âh) and means
to see and enjoy life. No one really adjusts in life until they find their
right man or right woman. Then they may not adjust. “With the woman whom you
love” means that with the woman you were designed to love in eternity past (qal
perfect) all the days of the life of your emptiness whom He God has given you
under the sun. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Enjoy life with the woman whom you love all the days of
your fleeting life which He has given to you under the sun; for this is your
reward in life and in your toil in which you have labored under the sun.&quot; 
(Ecclesiastes 9:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“All the days of your fleeting life” is <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>הבל</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(hebel) and means vapor, wind, breath,
emptiness. Even a man with an empty life can have happiness with his right
woman. There is one thing in life that can make even the most miserable person
happy, marrying their right woman! God did not design drugs, alcohol, or
adultery for happiness. There is no such thing as perversion between the
husband and wife in marriage, if it is agreeable to both. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Which He has given to you under the sun” means God gives
you this in time when you are alive. Grace is like rain, it falls on the just
and unjust. “For this is your reward in life” refers to a reward of happiness
with your right woman. God has provided the right kind of woman for every man
on earth. God has provided the right kind of woman for every man on earth. The
objective in seeking that opposite number before marriage is to confirm what is
in their soul. Only there will one be able to confirm if the one you see in the
one that is right for you. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Literal translation Eccl 9:9, “Enjoy life because
whenever a right man is with his right woman there is a whole lifetime of
blessing. With the right woman whom you have loved all the days of your life of
emptiness whom God has given you under the sun all the days of emptiness, for
this is your portion in life and in your profession (occupation) in which you
are working under the sun.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A man can be happy with his wife and having a job that
suits him. The woman can also be happy with her husband and having a job that
suits her. Both must remember to keep their relationship with the Lord as
priority one. The marriage comes second with the family third, then the jobs. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Creation of The Man</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 2:7, the Lord God (Jehovah Elohim) is a title
that refers to Jesus Christ in the singular and Elohim in the plural. Jesus
Christ is a member of the Godhead and His essence is exactly the same as the
Godhead. He performed all original acts of creation. Notice that Jesus Christ
is doing something for man before the old sin nature. Without an old sin
nature, Jesus Christ could do many wonderful things for him. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then the LORD God formed man of dust from the ground, and
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living
being.&quot;  (Genesis 2:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One was sex with another being in companionship. Why did
man step out of the Garden? He chose sex rather than learning Bible doctrine.
“Formed” is the qal imperfect of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>יצר</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(yâtsar) and is a
body word, male body and means to fashion, to devise. “Man” is ha adam - the
Adam. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Dust from the ground” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>אדמה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>('ădâmâh) and refers to the chemicals in the soil
which God used to form the body of the man. “And breathed” is the qal imperfect
of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>נפח</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(nâphach) and means
mouth to mouth resuscitation. “Nostrils” is the plural of <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>אף</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>('aph) meaning two nostrils. “Breath” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>נשׁמה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(neshâmâh) and means the spark of lives.
A soul is not activated until the first breath. Isaiah 57:16. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;For I will not contend forever, Nor will I always
be angry; For the spirit would grow faint before Me, And the breath of those
whom I have made.&quot;  (Isaiah 57:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 2:7, “breath of life” is lives, literally and
refers to the soul and human spirit. The woman’s soul is in incubation at this
point. “And man” with the definite article “ha Adam” means literally the one
man, the first man by himself. “Became” is the qal imperfect of <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>היה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(hâyâh) and means kept on being. “A
living being” refers to image, essence, and in likeness because it has
personality. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The literal translation of Genesis 2:7 is: “And Jesus
Christ designed Adam (the man) from the dust of the ground and breathed into
his nostrils the breath of lives and the man (Adam) became a soul of life.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Man was created in the image of God (tselem), the shadow
image, the essence. All of us have self-consciousness, etc. Man was created in
the likeness of God (demuth), model or pattern. This means personality where
all have the same essence, but each has a different personality. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are two verbs used for the creation of man’s soul.
Barah is used for creation of man’s soul in Genesis 1:27 and Genesis 5:1-2
(essence). Asah is used for creation of man’s soul in Genesis 1:26 and Isaiah
57:16 (personality). There is a verb for the creation of the male body, yatsar
in Genesis 2:7. There is one verb for the creation of the female body, banah
and is used in Genesis 2:22. On the sixth day of the restoration of the earth,
the souls of man and woman were created (barah), but only man became a living
soul. Gen. 2:7. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then the LORD God formed man of dust from the ground, and
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living
being.&quot;  (Genesis 2:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The LORD God fashioned into a woman the rib which He had
taken from the man, and brought her to the man.&quot;  (Genesis 2:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>After the elapse of time when Adam categorizing lower
creation, the body of the woman was fashioned (Gen. 2:22) and her soul was
taken from man and put into the body made from his rib and then she became a
living soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Creation of The Woman </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Man was on earth a long time before Ishshah came and it
could have been as much as 150 years, but we don’t know for sure. He had a
cataloging job to do and then he was to play. God made it possible for him not
to mix work and play. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 2:18, “Lord God” is Jesus Christ,
Jehovah-Elohim. God's grace always recognizes man’s need. At  that time, only
rapport love toward God (<i>agape</i>) existed for Adam. Rapport toward the
opposite sex (<i>eros</i>) existed only when the woman came on the scene.
Rapport toward people and friend (<i>phileo</i>) would not arrive until after
the fall and redemption. In innocence, Adam nor Eve ever thought of anything
but rapport toward the opposite sex (<i>eros</i>) and there was no need for
“friendship.” </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then the LORD God said, &quot;It is not good for the man
to be alone; I will make him a helper suitable for him.&quot;&quot;  (Genesis
2:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Said” is the qal perfect of <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>אמר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>('âmar) and refers to the divine decrees with Jesus
Christ actually having the floor. “Not good” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>טוֹב</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(lo tob) with no verb. This is the observation of Jesus
Christ. “For the man to be alone” is the qal infinitive construct of <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>היה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(hâyâh) and means not good for man to be
alone. Not good for man to be solitary or alone. He noticed that there was a
male and female in everything. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Man spent his first 30 years in the zoo. “I will make him
a helper” means “I will make for him a helper” and is the qal imperfect of <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>עָשָׂה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(asah). He already has the woman’s soul
incubated in Adam and will pull it out while Adam is asleep. He also has an
extra rib in Adam’s body and he is going to pull that out and manufacture
woman. “Helper suitable for him” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>עזר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>(‛êzer) plus  kenegedaw (the preposition <i>ke</i> followed by noun <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>נגד</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> (neged) literally, a help over against him, a help responding
to him.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Translation of Genesis 2:18: And Jehovah Elohim (Jesus
Christ) said, no good the man to be alone, I will manufacture for him a help
over against him, a help responding to him. In Genesis 2:20b, the woman was not
brought onto the scene until a span of time had elapsed. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The man gave names to all the cattle, and to the birds of
the sky, and to every beast of the field, but for Adam there was not found a
helper suitable for him.&quot;  (Genesis 2:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“But for Adam there was not found” is the qal perfect of <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>מצא</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(mâtsâ') and means to find, to discover,
to attain, acquire. Literally, but for Adam was not discovered a help
responding to him. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 2:21, “to fall” is the hiphil imperfect of <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>נפל</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(nâphal) causative active voice. “And he
slept” is the qal imperfect (during this process) of <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>ישׁן</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(yâshên). “And He took” is the qal imperfect of <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>לקח</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(lâqach) and means to seize violently.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man,
and he slept; then He took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh at that
place.&quot;  (Genesis 2:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Ribs” is the noun <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>צלע</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(tsêlâ‛) in the feminine with a third person masculine
suffix. It belonged to Adam, but it was a feminine rib inside of him all the
time. This is not the normal word for rib, but usually used for the joist or
beam of a building as in 1 Kings 6:16 and 1 Kings 7:3. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He built twenty cubits on the rear part of the house with
boards of cedar from the floor to the ceiling; he built them for it on the
inside as an inner sanctuary, even as the most holy place.&quot;  (1 Kings
6:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;It was paneled with cedar above the side chambers which
were on the 45 pillars, 15 in each row.&quot;  (1 Kings 7:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is a building team. “He closed up the flesh” is the
qal imperfect of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>סגר</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(sâgar) and means to
close up the breach, to close up the gap with flesh. Now we have a rib in the
hands of the Lord Jesus Christ. Actually, Jesus Christ had in His hands
something that would ultimately bring man great happiness or a great deal of
unhappiness. Nothing in between. That was a dramatic moment because whatever He
did with that would affect every household in the world. The principle here is
that God provides perfectly, but people have volition and can botch the whole
thing up. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 2:22, “the rib” means that now Adam is missing
something and the only way he gets it back is through the woman God provided to
him. 1 Cor. 11:8-9, 1 Cor. 11:12. “Fashioned” is the qal imperfect, third
masculine singular of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>בּנה</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(bânâh) and means
He built the woman. The man’s body was created. The woman’s body was fashioned
as a house constructed for the woman’s soul. “He had taken” is the qal perfect
of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>לקח</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(lâqach) and means
to take or seize. Jesus Christ had seized the rib from the man or <i>ha 'âdâm</i>.
</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The LORD God fashioned into a woman the rib which He had
taken from the man, and brought her to the man.&quot;  (Genesis 2:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For man does not originate from woman, but woman from
man; for indeed man was not created for the woman's sake, but woman for the
man's sake.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 11:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For as the woman originates from the man, so also the man
has his birth through the woman; and all things originate from God.&quot;  (1
Corinthians 11:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“A woman” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>אשּׁה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>('ishshâh) and is one of the words for body. Woman has a body which is
different from anything else in creation. “Brought her to the man” is the
hiphil imperfect of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>בּוא</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(bô') and is a
causative stem and means He caused her to be brought to the man. This was the
first right man-right woman. If people will wait and keep their lives straight,
God will provide.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the past, Jesus Christ brought to Adam creatures for
him to name them - elephants, zebras, mice, rats, buzzards, everything. Now, He
brings to Adam something completely different. What are you going to call this
one, Adam? And there stood this absolutely beautiful doll. Jesus Christ has a
great sense of humor. Gen. 2:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The man said, &quot;This is now bone of my bones, And
flesh of my flesh; She shall be called Woman, Because she was taken out of
Man.&quot;&quot;  (Genesis 2:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Even though Adam was a genius, it took him a couple of
seconds to know he had his perfect counterpart. He called her 'Ishshâh. There
is a woman whose body and soul is perfectly designed for you! Scare you a
little bit? Perfect divine design. No one else will quite do. Some of you think
that God said, “Thou shalt not commit adultery,” so that you couldn’t have any
fun. No, He said that so you could have fun with the right kind of woman for
you in marriage. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 2:23, “This is now” should really be “This
now” as there is no verb here. “This” is the demonstrative feminine pronoun <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>זה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(zeh) and the only way to translate the
phrase is “This one she.” What Adam saw took his breath away. She was the most
beautiful woman ever formed and she doesn’t have a thing on, neither does Adam.
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For the record, he has not touched her yet. Why? Proper
identification of the woman meant for you comes in the soul before the body is
ever touched. So far, Adam’s identification is based only on her physical
appearance. This means that when you find someone who you think is the right
one for you, the physical attraction is no problem at all! “Bone of my bones”
means he knew something was missing and that she would complete him and he
would fulfill her. What was missing would come back with grace interest! </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Flesh of my flesh” means identical flesh with his. He
understood immediately that this was not animal flesh or bird flesh. “She shall
be called” is the niphil, passive voice of the qal, <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>קרא</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(qârâ'). “Woman” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>אשּׁה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>('ishshâh).  “Because she was taken out
of Man” is the pual perfect of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>לקח</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(lâqach). He has
grand passion. “Man” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>אישׁ</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>('ı̂ysh) pronounced
Ish. This is not “ha Adam” now, but Ish).</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The translation of Genesis 2:23 is, “And Adam said, This
one she now bone from my bones, flesh from my flesh; this one she shall be
called 'Ishshâh (woman) because this one she was taken from Ish.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The introduction of the man to his wife is always done by
Jesus Christ. How? By Bible doctrine, either doctrine for the believer or
divine establishment doctrine for the unbeliever.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 2:24, “For this reason” is <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>על</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'><span dir=LTR></span> <span dir=RTL>כּן</span></span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (‛al kên) and means for this cause. “A
man shall” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>אישׁ</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>('ı̂ysh), not Adam or
ha Adam. There are no in-laws around now, no parents, friendships. They will be
completely satisfied with each other. They have perfect environment in every
way. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For this reason a man shall leave his father and his
mother, and be joined to his wife; and they shall become one flesh.&quot; 
(Genesis 2:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They have Bible class every day. They have the most
perfect soul rapport and sex relationship. They have lots of groceries. The
weather is fantastic. And Eve has plenty of pets, dozens of baby tigers and
parrots, etc. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Now up to this point there was one principle in the
garden and that was the principle of Volition. What protects volition?
Obedience to the revealed Word of God. Now was soon to be a second principle in
the garden called Marriage. What protects marriage? The man protects the
marriage. In Ephesians 5:23, the man the head or <span lang=EL>κεφαλη</span>́
(kephalē) in the Greek and means superior rank. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also
is the head of the church, He Himself being the Savior of the body.&quot; 
(Ephesians 5:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 2:24, “Shall leave” is the qal imperfect of <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>עָזַב</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(azab) and means to forsake, or depart, to
abandon. For this cause, man (Ish) shall abandon his father and his mother. But
Divine Institution No. 3 - Family means that the parents were designed to
protect Divine Institution No. 2 – Marriage in that the parents are to train a
man to be a gentleman, not to be a tyrant and to teach a woman to be a young
lady and to respond.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“And be joined to his wife” is the qal perfect of <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>דּבק</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(dâbaq) and means sexual intercourse,
cohabitation, sex. Human bodies were designed for that. “His ishshah” is his
right woman, one man for one woman. “And they (he and his woman) shall become
one flesh.” Literally. Adam got her back, passionately.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Why Parents?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God protects the woman from tyranny from the man who has
the authority over her by adding another divine institution to the Laws of
Divine Establishment to accompany the principle of husband-wife relationships. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>While marriage is the protection of sexual love where the
man is the authority, man learns love and respect for the woman from his
parents! This has never been true in the animal kingdom. This is only true in
the human race, not even in the angelic race. The little boy has parents and
mom and pop both have a contribution to make to teach him to have respect for
womanhood so that when he has found the right kind of woman for him, the
relationship will be the ultimate in happiness and they won’t mess it up. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Man is first a little boy with a mother who teaches him
principles of authority without abuse. However, if the father is brutal toward
the mother, she can’t teach him. The little boy watches his father. If his
father treats his mother well, he learns by example, but he learns the
principle of the relationship and God's intended design for marriage from his
mother. A boy’s attitude toward his mother indicates the attitude he will have
toward his wife.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When the little boy becomes a monster in adolescence and
the mother cannot handle him physically, the mental attitude of respect is
missing. Here, the father must exert his authority and law down the rules of
the household and enforce them. This protects his wife. In that environment,
respect can be taught which will smooth the adolescent out. Based on his
respect for his mother, he doesn’t even think about verbal insults or hitting
his mother because he has learned respect for his mother and a broader respect
for women in general. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When boys don’t learn respect from their mothers, they
revert to animals. If their father was cruel to the mother or if the father was
a tyrant and always chews out the mother, then the boy will emulate his father.
If the boy never saw the love, gentleness, or tenderness that can exist between
a husband and a wife, he can become an animal. He will then fornicate with
anything that he can track down.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is a principle here that you need to understand. In
human history, there have been many instances where governments removed the
children from their parents. They did it in China, in Russia, and in North
Korea. The Spartans did the same thing. When the Spartan boys reached 7 years
or age, they took them away from their mothers and they trained them to be a
warriors. They were vicious and cruel and resulted in Spartan warriors that
were cruel animals. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A boy always loses something by not having a good
relationship with his mother and vice versa. Your mother is the only one who
can teach you certain principles. The father sets the example, but the mother
is the first teacher of a boy. When the father is away working, the mother has
the boy at home. The mothers is the first teacher of all children, male or
female. She also teaches her daughter how to respond, to have poise, and to
behave as a young lady. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The father sets an example, provides security, provides
discipline, provides a lot of training past a certain stage. There is love for
womankind first when a little boy loves and respects his mother.  This gives
him both perspective and training to fulfill his right woman, without abusing
his divine given authority under Divine Institution #2 - Marriage. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Application of these principles means it is the
responsibility of parents to teach the child to become a gentleman so that when
he becomes a man he will not be an animal. A gentleman has respect for
womankind and does not abuse it. The male who does not have respect for
womankind is an animal. 1 Cor. 11:12. And yet respect for womankind must never
be a hindrance, therefore he will leave at a certain time. But when he leaves,
he enters into the greatest and most marvelous relationship of his life. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For as the woman originates from the man, so also the man
has his birth through the woman; and all things originate from God.&quot;  (1
Corinthians 11:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Honeymoon Couple </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The man and the woman have started their sex relationship
as an expression of husband-wife love. In Genesis 2:25, “the man and his wife”
is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>אדם</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(ha 'âdâm) and his <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>אשּׁה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>('ishshâh) “were both naked” is the qal
perfect of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>ערום</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(‛ârôm) and means
that they started that way. They didn’t put any clothes on. When they tried to
put on clothes, they manufactured the wrong kind - fig leaves. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And the man and his wife were both naked and were not
ashamed.&quot;  (Genesis 2:25, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“And were not ashamed” is the hithpael imperfect, third
masculine plural (true of both of them). of <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>בּוּשׁ</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(bûsh) and means to be confused,
perplexed, disappointed. The hithpael can be reflexive or passive. It means
that “they were not confused or disappointed,” but it is stronger. They did not
disappoint or confuse themselves. Why? They did not have any hang-ups about
their physical relationship. They were not ashamed. Anything that a husband and
wife agree to in marriage is not perversion! </p>
