<h2>Abomination of Desolation</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Abomination of Desolation will be the statue of the
Dictator of the Revived Roman Empire (also known as the Beast, the king of the
West, and the First Beast) in the Tribulation. Matthew 24:15-16 and Mark 13:14
use the placing of the statue as a warning to the Jews to flee Jerusalem
immediately for the mountains. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Therefore when you see the ABOMINATION OF
DESOLATION which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy
place (let the reader understand), then those who are in Judea must flee to the
mountains.&quot;  (Matthew 24:15-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;But when you see the ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION
standing where it should not be (let the reader understand), then those who are
in Judea must flee to the mountains.&quot;  (Mark 13:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Daniel prophesied that the Abomination of Desolation
would occur in the Tribulation and would stand for 1,290 days or three and
one-half years. Dan. 11:31; Dan. 12:11. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Forces from him will arise, desecrate the sanctuary
fortress, and do away with the regular sacrifice. And they will set up the
abomination of desolation.&quot;  (Daniel 11:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;From the time that the regular sacrifice is
abolished and the abomination of desolation is set up, there will be 1,290
days.&quot;  (Daniel 12:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The reason for the placing of the statue in the temple in
Jerusalem will be part of an alliance between the two dictators, the Dictator
of the Revived Roman Empire and the Dictator of Palestine both of whom will be
demon possessed. The statue will be erected for the “protection” of Palestine
during the first half of the Tribulation. Dan. 9:27; Rev. 13:2; Rev. 13:11-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;And he will make a firm covenant with the many for
one week, but in the middle of the week he will put a stop to sacrifice and
grain offering; and on the wing of abominations will come one who makes
desolate, even until a complete destruction, one that is decreed, is poured out
on the one who makes desolate.&quot;&quot;  (Daniel 9:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his
feet were like those of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. And the
dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority.&quot; 
(Revelation 13:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth; and
he had two horns like a lamb and he spoke as a dragon. He exercises all the
authority of the first beast in his presence. And he makes the earth and those
who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose fatal wound was
healed.&quot;  (Revelation 13:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Dictator of Palestine will have power to give life to
the image. The demon will go into the statue and the statue will begin talking.
There will be death for those who do not worship the image of the Beast. Rev.
13:15. See category on <a href="#_The_Mark_of">The Mark of the Beast</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And it was given to him to give breath to the image of
the beast, so that the image of the beast would even speak and cause as many as
do not worship the image of the beast to be killed.&quot;  (Revelation 13:15,
NASB)</p>
