<h2><a name="_Abrahamic_Covenant"></a>Abrahamic Covenant</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Abrahamic Covenant is God's promise to Abraham and
his descendants. Abraham was promised land (the land of Canaan), seed
(descendants), and blessing (through faith) forever if they utilize God’s grace
provision. This is the basic covenant. The Abrahamic Covenant is found in the
conversation between God and Abraham in Genesis 12, 13, 15, 17, and 22. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Abrahamic Covenant defines the new race of Jews for the
nation of Israel. Abraham became the first of a race of Jews and the first
Jewish believer at age 99. His circumcision was the outward sign of his belief
in the future Messiah for salvation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Abrahamic Covenant says that the seed of the woman,
the humanity of Christ, will descend from Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Gen. 12:1-3;
Gen. 13:15-16; Gen. 15:18; Gen. 22:15-18; Gen. 26:3-4; Exodus 6:2-8.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now the LORD said to Abram, &quot;Go forth from your
country, And from your relatives And from your father's house, To the land
which I will show you; And I will make you a great nation, And I will bless
you, And make your name great; And so you shall be a blessing; And I will bless
those who bless you, And the one who curses you I will curse. And in you all
the families of the earth will be blessed.&quot;&quot;  (Genesis 12:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;for all the land which you see, I will give it to you and
to your descendants forever. &quot;I will make your descendants as the dust of
the earth, so that if anyone can number the dust of the earth, then your
descendants can also be numbered.&quot;  (Genesis 13:15-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying,
&quot;To your descendants I have given this land, From the river of Egypt as
far as the great river, the river Euphrates:&quot;  (Genesis 15:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Sojourn in this land and I will be with you and bless
you, for to you and to your descendants I will give all these lands, and I will
establish the oath which I swore to your father Abraham. &quot;I will multiply
your descendants as the stars of heaven, and will give your descendants all
these lands; and by your descendants all the nations of the earth shall be
blessed;” (Genesis 26:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first eleven chapters of the Bible cover many, many
years. Actually these chapters are the introduction to the Old Testament.
Suddenly in Genesis 12, rapid chronology comes to a stop. One human family is
selected and described in great detail. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The three most important verses in all of the Word of God
are found in Genesis 12:1-3. Abraham is promised three things by God: land,
seed, and blessing. This foundational promise gives us the theme of the entire
Bible and everything is related to it.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The diagram below pictures the foundational Abrahamic
Covenant and shows the relationship of the three other unconditional covenants
to Israel. The basic Abrahamic Covenant is constantly repeated and explained in
the Bible. The land promises are amplified in the Palestinian Covenant. The
seed promises are amplified in the Davidic Covenant. The blessing promises are
amplified in the New Covenant.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><img src="./Abrahamic%20Covenant.png" style="width: 800px; height: auto;"></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Abrahamic Covenant is found in Genesis 12, 13, 15, 17
and 22. It is a clear text. Interpretation of this covenant affects related
theology, especially in the areas of Eschatology and Soteriology. Consequently,
there are four major points to stress regarding this covenant. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This covenant is to be interpreted literally. This
covenant is eternal in its expanse. This covenant is unconditional on Abraham’s
part. This covenant was made with the nation Israel, that is with Abraham and
his descendants, not Gentiles. Note that the blessing of Abraham is to come
upon the Gentiles also. Heb. 6:13-20; Gal. 3:13-18; Rom. 4:1-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For when God made the promise to Abraham, since He could swear
by no one greater, He swore by Himself, saying, &quot;I WILL SURELY BLESS YOU
AND I WILL SURELY MULTIPLY YOU.&quot;” (Hebrews 6:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law, having become a
curse for us—for it is written, &quot;CURSED IS EVERYONE WHO HANGS ON A
TREE&quot;— in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to
the Gentiles, so that we would receive the promise of the Spirit through
faith.” (Galatians 3:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather according
to the flesh, has found? For if Abraham was justified by works, he has
something to boast about, but not before God. For what does the Scripture say?
&quot;ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS CREDITED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS.&quot;”
(Romans 4:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Exposition of the Abrahamic Covenant</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Genesis 12:2-3 forms the seed-plot for the entire Word of
God and for the nation of Israel regarding God’s dealing with the covenant
people. Israel begins here. Therefore, these verses are introductory and are
very important.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And I will make you a great nation, And I will bless you,
And make your name great; And so you shall be a blessing; And I will bless
those who bless you, And the one who curses you I will curse. And in you all
the families of the earth will be blessed.&quot;&quot;  (Genesis 12:2-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are dealing with foundations here. An illustration of
this is found in the builder’s trade. Sometimes it takes as long to drive the
piles and prepare the foundation for a 50-story skyscraper as it does to
construct the tower superstructure. It is important that the right foundation
is laid in the Bible so that the superstructure (the other 65 books) does not
lean and topple. The Bible can be likened to a 66 story building with Genesis
as the foundation and Revelation as the penthouse. There are at least four
things promised in Genesis 12:2-3.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“A great nation.” What does a nation need? People and
land. God promised Israel land and a great number of people. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“I will bless you.” Abraham will be blessed materially
and spiritually. He will be a channel of blessing for untold millions. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“And make your name great.” What made a name great in
those days? Progeny! This indicates that Abraham will have children that will
populate the land. The Old Testament uses the term “seed” to indicate children.
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“And in you all the families of the earth will be
blessed.” His appointment includes being the possessor and dispenser of the
blessing. Blessing and cursing of men to be dependent entirely upon their
attitude toward Abraham and to his descendants. A curse means to not prosper in
contrast to blessing which means to prosper. The blessing promised to Abraham
was to unite the divided families of the world. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is great emphasis here on land, seed, and blessing.
Was this real land? Real estate? Really? Remember that it was real land
promised here on earth, not in heaven. Every time the word “land” appears in
the Bible, it means just that, land. The literal interpretation of the Bible is
very important. Gen. 12:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Abram took Sarai his wife and Lot his nephew, and all
their possessions which they had accumulated, and the persons which they had
acquired in Haran, and they set out for the land of Canaan; thus they came to
the land of Canaan.&quot;  (Genesis 12:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Land is needed for a nation. A nation cannot exist
without land and the seed promise provides for the people to dwell in that
land. Blessing will come as a result. Gen. 13:14-17. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The LORD said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him,
&quot;Now lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are, northward
and southward and eastward and westward; for all the land which you see, I will
give it to you and to your descendants forever. &quot;I will make your
descendants as the dust of the earth, so that if anyone can number the dust of
the earth, then your descendants can also be numbered. &quot;Arise, walk about
the land through its length and breadth; for I will give it to
you.&quot;&quot;  (Genesis 13:14-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>By the way, how long was this land given to Abraham and
his seed? Look at Genesis 13:15. Forever. Abraham and his descendants were
promised real land forever. Will there be real land in eternity then? Is there
anything that talks about an eternal earth in the Bible? Yes, it does in
Revelation 21 – the New Heavens and the New Earth including the New Jerusalem.
Read it. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;for all the land which you see, I will give it to you and
to your descendants forever.&quot;  (Genesis 13:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Up to this point, Abraham has been promised seed, but not
too specifically. In Genesis 13, however, he is directly told that he is going
to have a group of descendants too large to count. Abraham is also told to walk
throughout the whole land. This was the land of Canaan. It was given to him as
a grace gift from God. Did Abraham deserve this gift? No. Abraham didn’t
deserve anything. It was unconditionally given to him and his seed on the basis
of grace. Gen. 13:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I will make your descendants as the dust of the earth,
so that if anyone can number the dust of the earth, then your descendants can
also be numbered.” (Genesis 13:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Names of Abraham and Sarah</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Abram means “father of high and lofty places” or “father
of the winds.” When his name was lengthened to Abraham, it meant “father of
many nations.” Sarai meant “contentious or nagger.” But later it was changed to
Sarah which meant “princess.” The meaning of names was much more important in
the Old Testament than today. Again, the grace of God was extended to Abraham
and his wife. A close study of this family will convince the Bible student that
they were very human and had their failures. The Bible always gives an honest
account. Gen. 15:1-3. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in
a vision, saying, &quot;Do not fear, Abram, I am a shield to you; Your reward
shall be very great.&quot; Abram said, &quot;O Lord GOD, what will You give me,
since I am childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?&quot;
And Abram said, &quot;Since You have given no offspring to me, one born in my
house is my heir.&quot;&quot;  (Genesis 15:1-3, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 15:1, “I am a shield to you” uses the word
“shield” and is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>מְגִנָּה</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(meginnah) and means
protector. In “Your reward shall be very great,”  the word “reward” is used and
is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שׂכר</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(śâkâry) and means
compensation for work done, wages, salary. Abraham was living in wild, open,
rough and barren country. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What was Abraham’s problem? God had promised him land,
seed, and blessing. It looked like he’d been given everything. Abraham’s
problem was in his human viewpoint because he had no children at that time and
was far too old to produce any. Abraham was 75 and Sarah was 65 when they left
Haran. They were “over the hill” as far as having children was concerned. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Abraham almost seemed to think that God didn’t know the
facts of life. Abraham was smart enough to know that he could not farm a ranch
the size of Canaan without help. Actually, the land and blessing promises meant
little or nothing without children. So he was concerned because he was thinking
human viewpoint instead of divine viewpoint. What would you be thinking under
these circumstances?</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Eliezer, according to custom, would inherit Abraham’s
goods since there was no child, so Abraham suggested this to God. God said “no”
in Genesis 15:4-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then behold, the word of the LORD came to him, saying,
&quot;This man will not be your heir; but one who will come forth from your own
body, he shall be your heir.&quot; And He took him outside and said, &quot;Now
look toward the heavens, and count the stars, if you are able to count
them.&quot; And He said to him, &quot;So shall your descendants
be.&quot;&quot;  (Genesis 15:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This was rather frank, wasn’t it? God told Abraham that
he didn’t have to worry. God always carries out what He promises. “You are
going to have children.” God reassures him that Eliezer will not be his heir.
Then, he is challenged to count the stars. This illustrates innumerable seed.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Do you get the picture here? Abraham was told he will
have children, but he doesn’t have any. He was too old. Absolutely impossible!
What was Abraham to believe? The clear promise of God! Will he believe it or
won’t he? </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Abraham believed in the Lord as his Messiah to come and
in response to that positive volition, God counted it to him for righteousness.
God imputed His very own perfect righteousness to Abraham. Abraham was now a
believer. Gen. 15:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then he believed in the LORD; and He reckoned it to him
as righteousness.&quot;  (Genesis 15:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believing must be in the Lord and must be personal.
Abraham had believed in the future work of the Messiah – the Lord Jesus Christ
while he lived in Ur of the Chaldees. We see this from the perfect tense of the
Hebrew verb<span style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'> </span><span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>אמן</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'><span dir=LTR></span> </span>('âman)
which indicates an action that had already been completed in the past with
continuing results. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When Abraham had believed in Ur of the Chaldees, it had
been credited to him as absolute righteousness. The term “reckoned” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>חשׁב</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(châshaba)
and is a bookkeeping term. Abraham, because of sin and human good was
completely in debt to God with no ability to ever pay the debt. He was on the
minus side of the ledger. Rom. 3:23; Isaiah 64:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of
God,&quot;  (Romans 3:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For all of us have become like one who is unclean, And
all our righteous deeds are like a filthy garment; And all of us wither like a
leaf, And our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.&quot;  (Isaiah 64:6,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Although Jesus Christ had not yet died on the cross, God
knew with absolute certainty in eternity past that Jesus Christ would go to the
Cross and die spiritually for the sins of mankind. God is omniscient, so He
knew exactly how the future would unfold. 1 Peter 1:19-20.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;but with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and
spotless, the blood of Christ. For He was foreknown before the foundation of
the world, but has appeared in these last times for the sake of you&quot;  (1
Peter 1:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>Abraham was in debt so far he
could never work it off. So Christ paid the debt through the Cross thus erasing
the debt. Then, God goes a step further and gives him His very own perfect
absolute righteousness. Just as Abraham had believed for salvation so he is to
believe that God will keep His promises to him. Rom. 8:32.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him over
for us all, how will He not also with Him freely give us all things?&quot; 
(Romans 8:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>But Abraham continues to worry by asking God in Genesis
15:8 how he will know that God's promise has been fulfilled. So he was told to
take some animals and lay them out thus and so. Later on he goes into a deep
sleep. God then by grace, enacts the Abrahamic Covenant.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He said, &quot;O Lord GOD, how may I know that I will
possess it?&quot;&quot;  (Genesis 15:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Worry had gotten Abraham out of fellowship and he needed
to confess sin biblically. From Genesis 15:12 on, a knowledge of prophecy is
offered. If you are not afraid of death and life after death, it will cut down
on the nightmares of life.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon
Abram; and behold, terror and great darkness fell upon him.&quot;  (Genesis
15:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Romans 4 also follows this pattern. First, it stresses
salvation by grace not works in Romans 1-11. Then, on the basis of having
believed in the Lord for salvation, Abraham kept on believing that God could
fulfill His promises in Genesis 15:13-25.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Confirmation of the Covenant</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Abraham wanted a confirmation of this promise as it
transcended all human thinking. There were several ways to confirm a covenant
in those days. By exchanging a bag of salt between the two parties or
exchanging sandals before witnesses, were two ways.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>By the blood covenant. This blood covenant involved
killing animals, splitting them, forming a corridor between the haves and then
the two parties would walk through the corridor together. Should one party fail
in his obligation he must be killed even as the animals were killed. The more
animals the richer the parties involved and the more serious the contract - a
heifer as a sin offering, a she goat as a reconciliation offering, a ram as a
propitiation offering, a turtle dove representing the deity of Christ, and a
young pigeon representing the resurrected humanity of Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What happened when Abraham fell into a deep sleep in
Genesis 15:12? He dreamed that there would be a 400-year period in which Israel
would not dwell in the promised land. They were to be afflicted by a foreign
power (Egypt) but were promised one day to be in the land. Then, symbolized by
a flaming torch (God) identified with a smoking stove (Abraham and his
seed--Abraham asleep) God moved alone between the slain animals. This signified
that he assumed all responsibility and Abraham and his seed were the receivers.
God thus assumed the responsibility for keeping the eternal covenant in effect.
Gen. 15:17-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram;
and behold, terror and great darkness fell upon him.” (Genesis 15:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“It came about when the sun had set, that it was very dark, and
behold, there appeared a smoking oven and a flaming torch which passed between
these pieces. On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, &quot;To
your descendants I have given this land, From the river of Egypt as far as the
great river, the river Euphrates:” (Genesis 15:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God then extended the boundary line of the land involved.
It projects from the Nile River to the Euphrates River. Even various tribes
living in these geographical boundaries are mentioned.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sarah had fallen for the old cliché, “God helps those who
help themselves.” It brought her nothing but heartache. The whole Arab-Israel
conflict begins right here in Genesis 16. Genesis 16:12 shows the general
behavior of the Arab.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;He will be a wild donkey of a man, His hand will be
against everyone, And everyone's hand will be against him; And he will live to
the east of all his brothers.&quot;&quot;  (Genesis 16:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Abraham loses his old name of Abram in Genesis 17. Father
of the winds is changed to father of many nations. And this was changed before
Isaac was born. Can you visualize Abraham going to town after his name was
changed and having people say, “Hi, Abram” and Abraham would say, “My name is
not Abram, it’s Abraham.” And they would look around and say, “Well, where are
the kids?” For Abraham meant father of many children. Gen. 17:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;No longer shall your name be called Abram, But your name
shall be Abraham; For I have made you the father of a multitude of nations.”
(Genesis 17:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>His name must have been a real crowd-stopper. Imagine.
Abraham had to answer by faith. Ishmael was the only one and he was of the
flesh. So God confirms again the Abrahamic Covenant in Genesis 17:6-8, and the
outward sign of the covenant was levied as circumcision. Circumcision is the
ritual of confirmation and acknowledgment of God’s grace. Sarai’s name
(contentious) was changed to Sarah (princess). From a nagger, she became a
princess in disposition by the grace of God. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will
make nations of you, and kings will come forth from you. &quot;I will establish
My covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you throughout their
generations for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your
descendants after you. &quot;I will give to you and to your descendants after
you, the land of your sojournings, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting
possession; and I will be their God.&quot;&quot;  (Genesis 17:6-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 21, the child Isaac (laughter) was born as
promised. And it was a miracle because their combined ages total 190. Friction
again was seen in this chapter between Ishmael and Isaac. And this friction
will not stop until the Second Advent.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now Abraham was one hundred years old when his son Isaac was
born to him. Sarah said, &quot;God has made laughter for me; everyone who hears
will laugh with me.&quot;” (Genesis 21:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Then finally in Genesis 22, Isaac is offered as a
sacrifice on the mountain that one day Christ would die upon and the covenant
was confirmed to Abraham in Genesis 22:17-18. Abraham offered his son Isaac,
only to receive him back. This taught both individual blessing imputed to the
mature believer and blessing by association to the nation and even to other
nations.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;indeed I will greatly bless you, and I will greatly
multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens and as the sand which is on the
seashore; and your seed shall possess the gate of their enemies. &quot;In your
seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because you have obeyed My
voice.&quot;&quot;  (Genesis 22:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Abraham had grown in the Lord, and was blessed
exceedingly. Abraham again quoted the promises in Genesis 24:7 and in Genesis
26 the covenant was confirmed to Isaac, and then to Jacob in Genesis 28.
Further references through the Old Testament prove that their prosperity or
disgrace revolved around the promises made to Abraham. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;The LORD, the God of heaven, who took me from my
father's house and from the land of my birth, and who spoke to me and who swore
to me, saying, 'To your descendants I will give this land,' He will send His
angel before you, and you will take a wife for my son from there.&quot; 
(Genesis 24:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Abrahamic Covenant relates to the nation of Israel
whereby Abraham and his spiritual seed are the beneficiaries of God's blessing
and grace provision. Abraham believed in God’s promise that he and Sarah would
have a son and that God was also able to fulfill His promise.  </p>
