<h2>Divinely-Authorized Forms of Authority</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are many areas of authority in life. Today in
America, there has been a breakdown in respect for the divinely-authorized
authority that has made life wonderful in the U.S. and made it a great client
nation. This lack of respect for legitimate authority has hit every area of
life, from the concept of God as the sovereign power to the military and its
chain of command. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When one has no respect for authority, then they becomes
the authority, caring little and without concern for how their antics may
affect others. They are a law unto themselves, little dictators never learning
how God has distributed authority among the human race for their good and His
glory.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Authority of God the Father</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has authority and He has claims on our life. It is
our responsibility to respond to Him. Deut. 6:4-5; Jude 1:24-25. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Hear, O Israel! The LORD is our God, the LORD is
one! &quot;You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all
your soul and with all your might.&quot;  (Deuteronomy 6:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling, and to
make you stand in the presence of His glory blameless with great joy, to the
only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion
and authority, before all time and now and forever. Amen.&quot;  (Jude 1:24-25,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has authority over nature and nature always obeys. It
is important for us to realize that nature obeys God because God has
established the laws of nature and upholds them. Matt. 8:27; Mark 4:41; Luke
8:25; Rom. 8:20-22.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The men were amazed, and said, &quot;What kind of a man
is this, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?&quot;&quot;  (Matthew 8:27,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“They became very much afraid and said to one another,
&quot;Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey Him?&quot;” (Mark
4:41, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He said to them, &quot;Where is your faith?&quot;
They were fearful and amazed, saying to one another, &quot;Who then is this,
that He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey Him?&quot;&quot; 
(Luke 8:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but
because of Him who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself also will be
set free from its slavery to corruption into the freedom of the glory of the
children of God. For we know that the whole creation groans and suffers the
pains of childbirth together until now.” (Romans 8:20-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has authority over angels. Mark 1:27; 1 Peter 3:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;They were all amazed, so that they debated among
themselves, saying, &quot;What is this? A new teaching with authority! He
commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him.&quot;&quot;  (Mark 1:27,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven,
after angels and authorities and powers had been subjected to Him.&quot;  (1
Peter 3:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Authority of the Word of God</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s authority in life is revealed through the written
Word of God - Bible doctrine. God has commanded the believer to obey. These
commands are always executed from God’s sovereignty and are carried out through
the function of the grace apparatus for perception. God has exalted His Word
(Bible doctrine) above His name. Psalms 138:2; Heb. 4:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I will bow down toward Your holy temple And give thanks
to Your name for Your lovingkindness and Your truth; For You have magnified
Your word according to all Your name.&quot;  (Psalms 138:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any
two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of
both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the
heart.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has delegated authority through His mandates in both
the Old Testament and the New Testament. The Word of God is the final authority
in matters of faith and practice. Deut. 11:27; 1 Sam. 15:22; Jer. 7:23; Jer. 7:25;
Jer. 11:4; Jer. 11:7; Zech. 6:15; 2 Tim. 3:16-17. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;the blessing, if you listen to the commandments of the
LORD your God, which I am commanding you today;&quot;  (Deuteronomy 11:27,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;But this is what I commanded them, saying, 'Obey My
voice, and I will be your God, and you will be My people; and you will walk in
all the way which I command you, that it may be well with you.'&quot; 
(Jeremiah 7:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“which I commanded your forefathers in the day that I brought
them out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, 'Listen to My
voice, and do according to all which I command you; so you shall be My people,
and I will be your God,'” (Jeremiah 11:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Those who are far off will come and build the temple of
the LORD.&quot; Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you.
And it will take place if you completely obey the LORD your God.” (Zechariah
6:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for
teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; so that
the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.&quot;  (2 Timothy
3:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Authority of the Pastor-Teacher in the Local Church</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher in the local church is the authority
to provide doctrinal or theological information from the Scripture.<span
style='color:#0432FF'> </span>The pastor-teacher and church officers have
authority over the congregation in the local church. Their authority comes from
the divine institutions. The pastor is the ultimate authority in the local
church government. 1 Cor. 16:15-16; 2 Cor. 10:8; 1 Thess. 5:12; Heb. 13:7; Heb.
13:17; Isaiah 54:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For even if I boast somewhat further about our authority,
which the Lord gave for building you up and not for destroying you, I will not
be put to shame,&quot;  (2 Corinthians 10:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But we request of you, brethren, that you appreciate those who
diligently labor among you, and have charge over you in the Lord and give you
instruction,” (1 Thessalonians 5:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Remember those who led you, who spoke the word of God to
you; and considering the result of their conduct, imitate their faith.&quot; 
(Hebrews 13:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch
over your souls as those who will give an account. Let them do this with joy
and not with grief, for this would be unprofitable for you.&quot;  (Hebrews
13:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>If the pastor-teacher teaches the
Word accurately, repeatedly, and categorically, he has authority. Eph. 4:11; Eph.
4; Heb. 13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and
some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers,&quot;  (Ephesians 4:11,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This does not mean that the pastor can be a dictator or
is perfect. Not at all! It means he must have authority if a local church is to
function properly. All serious trouble begins in a local church when someone
bucks the leadership in a local church. See category on <a
href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/A/Authority%20of%20Pastor-Teacher.html">Authority of the Pastor-Teacher</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Authority of Volition</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Volition is free will and self-determination and is your
authority and right to make choices for yourself.  2 Thess. 3:14-15; Gal.
5:22-23; the entire Book of Proverbs.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter,
take special note of that person and do not associate with him, so that he will
be put to shame. Yet do not regard him as an enemy, but admonish him as a
brother.&quot;  (2 Thessalonians 3:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience,
kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things
there is no law.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Galatians 5:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Authority of the Husband over the Wife in Marriage</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The husband is delegated the authority leadership in
marriage from God under Divine Institution #2 - Marriage. The authority of the husband
is meant to provide great happiness in the marriage relationship. This
authority and leadership stabilizes the love between husband and wife. Eph.
5:22; Col. 3:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the
Lord.&quot;  (Ephesians 5:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Authority of Parents Over Their Children</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Parents are given authority over their children under
Divine Institution #3 - Family. Parental authority is the basis for stability
in society. Eph. 6:1-4, Col. 3:20, Gen. 4 – Gen. 10; 2 Tim. 1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.
HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER (which is the first commandment with a promise),
SO THAT IT MAY BE WELL WITH YOU, AND THAT YOU MAY LIVE LONG ON THE EARTH.
Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the
discipline and instruction of the Lord.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 6:1-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Children, be obedient to your parents in all things, for
this is well-pleasing to the Lord.&quot;  (Colossians 3:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Children are to obey their parents in the Lord. Honor
your father and mother is the first commandment with promise. The parent in the
home has authority over their children and as such is to command respect and be
respected. Children must be taught the truth of self-discipline. Prov. 25:28.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Like a city that is broken into and without walls Is a
man who has no control over his spirit.&quot;  (Proverbs 25:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Children must be taught that the wrong crowd is the group
that has no respect for authority, for privacy, for property, for rights, or
for self-discipline. The child must be taught to have the Word at their
finger-tips. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Authority of Government</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Government has authority over its people to protect the
sanctity of their freedom, property, and human life. The authority of government
leadership is divinely delegated under Divine Institution # 4 – Nationalism.
This involves respecting local police (traffic laws, lights and signs), the
city level and mayor’s office, the state level and governor and the national
level with the president, congress, etc. Rom. 12; 1 Tim. 2; Rom. 13; 1 Tim. 2. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This includes the authority of the policeman and the
judge on the bench. Do you teach your children respect for the policemen or is
he just a nuisance to you and someone to avoid? Do you teach your children that
it is alright to break a law, if you don’t get caught? Matt. 22:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;They said to Him, &quot;Caesar's.&quot; Then He said to
them, &quot;Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and to God the
things that are God's.&quot;&quot;  (Matthew 22:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Laws regulate our lives for our own protection and
include city zoning, traffic laws, drug laws, etc. The book of Deuteronomy
gives this side of authority with regard to Israel which includes law
enforcement over citizens. Rom. 13:1-7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Every person is to be in subjection to the governing
authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist
are established by God.&quot;  (Romans 13:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is the authority of the judge on the bench from
local judges to national judges. The book of Judges illustrates this principle.
1 Cor. 6:1-8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Every person is to be in subjection to the governing
authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist
are established by God. Therefore whoever resists authority has opposed the
ordinance of God; and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon
themselves. For rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior, but for evil.
Do you want to have no fear of authority? Do what is good and you will have
praise from the same; for it is a minister of God to you for good. But if you
do what is evil, be afraid; for it does not bear the sword for nothing; for it
is a minister of God, an avenger who brings wrath on the one who practices
evil. Therefore it is necessary to be in subjection, not only because of wrath,
but also for conscience' sake. For because of this you also pay taxes, for
rulers are servants of God, devoting themselves to this very thing. Render to
all what is due them: tax to whom tax is due; custom to whom custom; fear to
whom fear; honor to whom honor.” (Romans 13:1-7, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Authority in Business</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Authority in business is designed to stabilize the economy.
Economic authority resides in business executives, investors, and management. Management
has authority over labor. Eph. 6:5; Col. 3:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Slaves, be obedient to those who are your masters
according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in the sincerity of your
heart, as to Christ;&quot;  (Ephesians 6:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Slaves, in all things obey those who are your masters on
earth, not with external service, as those who merely please men, but with
sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord.&quot;  (Colossians 3:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Do you recognize the authority of a boss or foreman in
business or do you always buck the front office? Are you always griping about
policies? 1 Tim. 6:1-2; 1 Peter 2:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;All who are under the yoke as slaves are to regard their
own masters as worthy of all honor so that the name of God and our doctrine
will not be spoken against. Those who have believers as their masters must not
be disrespectful to them because they are brethren, but must serve them all the
more, because those who partake of the benefit are believers and beloved. Teach
and preach these principles.&quot;  (1 Timothy 6:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Servants, be submissive to your masters with all respect,
not only to those who are good and gentle, but also to those who are
unreasonable.&quot;  (1 Peter 2:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Authority of the Coach in Athletics</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is authority in athletics from the coach and
referee. There must be discipline in the athlete and the coach cracks the whip
to improve the athlete and to keep them in line. Many boys never make it in
football because they don’t recognize the authority of the coach. They buck his
discipline. He must have authority to build a better athlete. 1 Cor. 9:24-27.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but only
one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may win. Everyone who
competes in the games exercises self-control in all things. They then do it to
receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable. Therefore I run in such a
way, as not without aim; I box in such a way, as not beating the air; but I
discipline my body and make it my slave, so that, after I have preached to
others, I myself will not be disqualified.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 9:24-27,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Authority in the Military</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Military authority resides in commissioned officers and
non-commissioned officers.  Rank is absolutely necessary. Matt. 8:8-9. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But the centurion said, “Lord, I am not worthy for You to come
under my roof, but just say the word, and my servant will be healed. “For I
also am a man under authority, with soldiers under me; and I say to this one, ‘Go!’
and he goes, and to another, ‘Come!’ and he comes, and to my slave, ‘Do this!’
and he does it.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 8:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You may not like the drill sergeant, but he is dedicated
to keeping the soldier alive in combat. Some who served in the military may not
have liked that loud mouth drill sarge barking out the orders in close-order
drill, but you knew he had authority. Judges 7:5-8 gives an illustration of
well-disciplined soldiers who recognized the authority of the military.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So he brought the people down to the water. And the LORD said
to Gideon, &quot;You shall separate everyone who laps the water with his tongue
as a dog laps, as well as everyone who kneels to drink.&quot; Now the number of
those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was 300 men; but all the
rest of the people kneeled to drink water. The LORD said to Gideon, &quot;I
will deliver you with the 300 men who lapped and will give the Midianites into
your hands; so let all the other people go, each man to his home.&quot; So the
300 men took the people's provisions and their trumpets into their hands. And
Gideon sent all the other men of Israel, each to his tent, but retained the 300
men; and the camp of Midian was below him in the valley.” (Judges 7:5-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the military, all superior officers are in authority
over those subordinate to them. Freedom through military victory is based on
the principle of the authority of military rank. Neh. 4:13-15.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;then I stationed men in the lowest parts of the space
behind the wall, the exposed places, and I stationed the people in families
with their swords, spears and bows. When I saw their fear, I rose and spoke to
the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people: &quot;Do not be afraid of
them; remember the Lord who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers,
your sons, your daughters, your wives and your houses.&quot; When our enemies
heard that it was known to us, and that God had frustrated their plan, then all
of us returned to the wall, each one to his work.&quot;  (Nehemiah 4:13-15,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Authority in Education</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Teachers have authority over students. There is school
authority in both academic and athletic administration, i.e., teachers and
coaches. In academics, the teacher in the classroom and the school administration
have authority over students. The teacher in a classroom is patterned from a
pastor-teacher in the local church with one in authority. 2 Tim. 2:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The things which you have heard from me in the presence
of many witnesses, entrust these to faithful men who will be able to teach
others also.&quot;  (2 Timothy 2:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There must be respect for the teacher in a classroom! The
school teacher and superintendent have authority and are to be respected. No
one can teach without authority. 2 Tim. 4:2. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;preach the word; be ready in season and out of season;
reprove, rebuke, exhort, with great patience and instruction.&quot;  (2 Timothy
4:2, NASB)</p>
