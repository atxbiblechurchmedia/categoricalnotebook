<h2>Angelic Conflict, Two Stages</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are two stages in the Angelic Conflict – The First
Advent of Jesus Christ and His Second Advent.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The First Advent of Jesus Christ was our Lord’s arrival
on earth to take on the form of humanity, to remain sinless in His humanity, to
go to the Cross and then die spiritually for the sins of all mankind, to die
physically by giving up His human spirit, to be resurrected, to ascend, and to
be seated in session in the highest place of honor at the right hand of God the
Father in the throne room of heaven. In the First Advent, Christ won the
strategic victory in the Angelic Conflict. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the Second Advent of Jesus Christ, He executes that
victory and removes Satan and all operative demons/fallen angels from the
earth. The Second Advent will involve His physical return to the earth with all
Church Age believers in their resurrection bodies to prepare the earth for the
establishment of His 1,000 year Millennial Kingdom on earth.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the end of Hebrews 1:3, Jesus Christ is seated at the
right hand of the majesty on high. The aorist tense means at a point in time.
He will remain there making His humanity in resurrection body higher than all
angels. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He is the radiance of His glory and the exact
representation of His nature, and upholds all things by the word of His power.
When He had made purification of sins, He sat down at the right hand of the
Majesty on high,&quot;  (Hebrews 1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In resurrection body, His humanity became infinitely
superior than all angels. His deity was, of course, always perfect and absolute
God. When He became superior in His humanity, He received an inheritance on
earth that is the Church – the Body of Christ made up of all Church Age
believers. Heb. 1:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;having become as much better than the angels, as He has
inherited a more excellent name than they.&quot;  (Hebrews 1:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the beginning of His session in the third heaven, His
inheritance, the Church, began formation. It is not yet completed. Upon
completion, it will be moved to heaven where the Heir is in session. During the
Tribulation, at the Judgment Seat of Christ, all Church Age believers’ human
good deeds will be burned away during that seven years. This is referred to as
purifying the bride of Christ. The Church Age believers in resurrection bodies
are cleansed and purified (human good removed and no old sin nature) before
they return with Jesus Christ at the Second Advent. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Then in Hebrews 1:5, the doctrine of the Hypostatic Union
which makes all this possible, undiminished deity linked with the perfect
humanity of Christ forever. Jesus Christ will always be the perfect God-Man. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For to which of the angels did He ever say, &quot;YOU ARE
MY SON, TODAY I HAVE BEGOTTEN YOU&quot;? And again, &quot;I WILL BE A FATHER TO
HIM AND HE SHALL BE A SON TO ME&quot;?&quot;  (Hebrews 1:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In at the Second Advent, all demons and Satan will be
removed from the earth and cast into the Abyss. When that is completed, there
will be a great angelic worship of our triumphant Lord. “And let all the angels
of God worship Him” refers to a special worship. Why a special worship? The
answer is that at the Second Advent, the Lord Jesus Christ will have defeated
and destroyed all of His enemies. At the end of the Millennium, only Satan will
be allowed to return to earth for a short last attempt to overthrow the kingdom
of Jesus Christ. He will utterly fail and will be cast into the Lake of Fire. Rev
20:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake
of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also; and they
will be tormented day and night forever and ever.&quot;  (Revelation 20:10,
NASB)</p>
