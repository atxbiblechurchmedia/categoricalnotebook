<h2><a name="_D-Apostleship,_Spiritual_Gift"></a>Apostleship, Spiritual Gift</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The spiritual gift of Apostleship was a temporary gift
and had the highest authority ever delegated by God in the Church Age. Many of
those given this gift by God the Holy Spirit on the Day of Pentecost are the
authors of the New Testament epistles who taught and wrote the mystery doctrines
that were not revealed in the Old Testament Scripture. All writers of the New
Testament were either apostles or someone closely associated with an apostle such
as Mark and Luke. These apostles wrote in the New Testament prophecy details of
the future dispensations which will follow the Church Age, both the Tribulation
and the Millennium. Rom. 16:25; 1 Cor. 12:28; Eph. 4:11; 1 Cor. 12:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now to Him who is able to establish you according to my
gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the
mystery which has been kept secret for long ages past,&quot;  (Romans 16:25,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And God has appointed in the church, first apostles,
second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps,
administrations, various kinds of tongues.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 12:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and
some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers,&quot;  (Ephesians 4:11,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But one and the same Spirit works all these things,
distributing to each one individually just as He wills.&quot;  (1 Corinthians
12:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The word “Apostle” is derived from the Attic Greek word <span
lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>πο</span>́<span lang=EL>στολος</span>
(apostolos) and means admiral, supreme commander, or one with highest rank. The
spiritual gift of <span lang=EL>Α</span>postleship was designed for two
purposes. One was the formation of the canon of Scripture, the New Testament.
The other purpose was leadership in the pre-canon period of the Church Age.
This leadership involved training of pastors, establishing local churches, and
teaching the mystery doctrines of the Church Age until the canon of Scripture
was completed. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Apostles to Israel and Apostles to the Church</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Bible distinguished between the 12 Apostles to Israel
and the 12 Apostles to the Church. The 12 Apostles to Israel were appointed by
Jesus Christ during His time on earth. The 12 Apostles to Israel functioned in
this role for about three years. Matt. 10:2-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now the names of the twelve apostles are these: The
first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; and James the son of
Zebedee, and John his brother; Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the
tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot, and
Judas Iscariot, the one who betrayed Him.&quot;  (Matthew 10:2-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>These 12 were; Simon (also called Peter), Andrew his
brother, James and John (also called the sons of Zebedee), Philip, Bartholomew
(also called Nathaniel), Doubting Thomas (also called Didymus), Matthew (also
called Levi), James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus (also called Jude), Simon
the Zealot (also called Simon the Canaanite), and Judas Iscariot. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Peter was not appointed an apostle to the Church in Matthew
16:18-19. The disciples were appointed Apostles to Israel at that time, not to
the Church. Matt. 10:5-7.</p>

<p class=Verses>““I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I
will build My church; and the gates of Hades will not overpower it. “I will
give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever you bind on earth
shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall have
been loosed in heaven.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 16:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“These twelve Jesus sent out after instructing them: “Do not go
in the way of the Gentiles, and do not enter any city of the Samaritans; but
rather go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. “And as you go, preach,
saying, ‘The kingdom of heaven is at hand.’”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 10:5-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There was only one of the 12 Apostles to Israel who was
not later given the gift of Apostle to the Church on the Day of Pentecost. That
one was Judas Iscariot. The remaining 11 apostles to Israel were given the
spiritual gift of Apostle to the Church after our Lord’s resurrection and
session. Eph. 4:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore it says, &quot;WHEN HE ASCENDED ON HIGH, HE LED
CAPTIVE A HOST OF CAPTIVES, AND HE GAVE GIFTS TO MEN.&quot;&quot;  (Ephesians
4:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul (previously known as Saul of Tarsus) was later
appointed one of the 12 Apostles to the Church. Rom. 1:1; 1 Cor. 15:9; Col.
1:1. Paul replaced Judas Iscariot according to 1 Corinthians 15:7-10. The
temporary spiritual gift of Apostleship functioned until the completed canon of
Scripture in 96 AD.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle,
set apart for the gospel of God,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 1:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For I am the least of the apostles, and not fit to be called
an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians
15:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and
Timothy our brother,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Colossians 1:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;then He appeared to James, then to all the apostles; and
last of all, as to one untimely born, He appeared to me also. For I am the
least of the apostles, and not fit to be called an apostle, because I
persecuted the church of God. But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His
grace toward me did not prove vain; but I labored even more than all of them,
yet not I, but the grace of God with me.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 15:7-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The spiritual gift of Apostleship gave the 12 absolute
authority over all of the local churches extant during the apostleship period
from the start of the Church Age in 30 AD until the completion of the canon of
the New Testament in 96 to 100 AD. In the post-canon period of the Church Age,
all local churches were autonomous under the authority of one pastor-teacher.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A key requirement to be appointed an Apostle to the
Church was that the apostle was an eye witness to the resurrected Christ. 1
Cor. 9:1; 1 Cor. 15:8-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our
Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord?”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 9:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and last of all, as to one untimely born, He appeared to me
also. For I am the least of the apostles, and not fit to be called an apostle,
because I persecuted the church of God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 15:8-9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul saw the resurrected Christ on the Damascus Road.
Acts 9:3-6; Acts 22:6-11; Acts 26:13-18. Then He appeared to Paul again in
Arabia. He again appeared to Paul in the temple. Acts 9:26-30; Acts 22:17-21.
Finally, He appeared to Paul in prison in Acts 23:11. So Paul saw the
resurrected Christ on four different occasions.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;As he was traveling, it happened that he was approaching
Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him; and he fell to
the ground and heard a voice saying to him, &quot;Saul, Saul, why are you
persecuting Me?&quot; And he said, &quot;Who are You, Lord?&quot; And He said,
&quot;I am Jesus whom you are persecuting, but get up and enter the city, and
it will be told you what you must do.&quot;&quot;  (Acts 9:3-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But on the night immediately following, the Lord stood at
his side and said, &quot;Take courage; for as you have solemnly witnessed to My
cause at Jerusalem, so you must witness at Rome also.&quot;&quot;  (Acts 23:11,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Spiritual Gift of Apostleship in the Book of Galatians</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first spiritual gift we find mentioned in Galatians
is Apostleship. The major functions of spiritual gifts in Galatians would
center on the features of the gift of Apostleship. The spiritual gift of
Apostleship would include the direct revelation of the content of Bible
doctrine in the writing down of the content of Scripture. This is not true of
any existing gift today. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The spiritual gift of Apostleship would include authority
over more than one church as the Epistle is written to the “churches of
Galatia.” This too is nonexistent today in a bona fide way. The spiritual gift
of Apostleship included the function of trouble-shooting as Paul did in dealing
with isolating and solving a particular problem in the churches of Galatia.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The spiritual gift of Apostleship included the function
of “shepherding” as he applies and teaches doctrine on spirituality, growth,
maturity, and divine good production. The spiritual gift of Apostleship also
included the function of “evangelizing” and is indicated by reference to this
type of preaching in Galatians 1. The spiritual gift of Apostleship included
for Paul a “specific niche” in which and to whom the major part of his ministry
would relate. He was an Apostle to the Gentiles and Peter was the Apostle to
the Jews.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Galatians verifies the principle that there is an
interdependent ministry of one spiritual gift to another spiritual gift on the
same level. Paul had a ministry to Peter, although they were both apostles. In
Galatians, Paul make it clear that spiritual gift production is not dependent
on human good excellence or reputation. Paul also made it clear that divine
good production is possible without human verification of your spiritual gift. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Galatians, Paul felt it important to clarify his
spiritual gift function and ministry to his peers, especially at Jerusalem.
Peter, James, and John recognized clearly the function of Paul’s spiritual gift
of Apostleship. This is the concept of others recognizing your spiritual gift.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Galatians also makes it clear that the possession of a
spiritual gift even on the level of an apostle does not keep one from falling.
Paul remained true in Galatians, but Peter crumbled. Both had the spiritual
gift of Apostleship. Paul did not make the spiritual gift an issue with the
Galatian people such as he did with the Corinthians. Believers who are stacked
up in legalism need Bible doctrine first so they can grow spiritually before
they should think about divine good production.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Although Paul was an apostle by spiritual gift, he
continually held forth the common bond of relationship he had with the people.
He stated that he was as they were. Paul’s spiritual gift of Apostle was many
things, but largely he applied it as a communicator in Galatians. The exercise
of his spiritual gift did not guarantee that people would utilize all his Bible
doctrine content or follow his authority. This was made clear by the fact of
their departure from the grace principle.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual gift production is always naturally desired to
be preserved and all who communicate Bible doctrine jealously guard their fruit
and message content. They respond decisively when anyone tampers with it. The
possession of a spiritual gift does not remove human frailties or problems.
This is made clear by the reference to Paul’s infirmities. The proper exercise
of the spiritual gift finds Jesus Christ as the one being glorified and not the
spiritual gift or the one possessing it.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Apostles Had Other Spiritual Gifts</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An apostle also had the gift of Miracles. Paul did not
have the gift of Healing at the end of his life. It was removed from him before
he died some ten years before in 57 AD. Phil. 2:27; 2 Tim. 4:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For indeed he was sick to the point of death, but God had
mercy on him, and not on him only but also on me, so that I would not have
sorrow upon sorrow.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Philippians 2:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Erastus remained at Corinth, but Trophimus I left sick at
Miletus.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Timothy 4:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Their use of miracles was necessary to sustain their
apostolic authority. Acts 5:15; Acts 16:16-18; Acts 28:8-9. No human being can
perform miracles at will today. 2 Cor. 12:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“to such an extent that they even carried the sick out into the
streets and laid them on cots and pallets, so that when Peter came by at least
his shadow might fall on any one of them.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 5:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And it happened that the father of Publius was lying in bed
afflicted with recurrent fever and dysentery; and Paul went in to see him and
after he had prayed, he laid his hands on him and healed him. After this had
happened, the rest of the people on the island who had diseases were coming to
him and getting cured.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 28:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The signs of a true apostle were performed among you with all
perseverance, by signs and wonders and miracles.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Corinthians
12:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Early Church Missionaries Called Apostles</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There were a number of missionaries in the early Church
given delegated authority by the 12 Apostles to the Church. They had tremendous
powers, but they were delegated powers. They were also called apostles, but did
not have the spiritual gift of Apostleship. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>These early Church missionaries had lesser spiritual
gifts such as pastor-teacher, prophecy, and evangelism and had the authority to
establish local churches much like foreign missionaries do today. A missionary
team should go to a country to form churches in that country. This requires
evangelism, recognizing those men with the spiritual gifts of communication,
and then training those men so that eventually local churches are established.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>These early Church missionaries included men like
Barnabas, James the Lord's half-brother, Apollos, Silas (Silvanus), Timothy,
Titus, Epaphroditus, Andronicus and Junias. They are called apostles in the
sense of being missionaries, but did not have the spiritual gift of Apostleship.
They had the delegated authority to establish churches, analogous to colonies
which were founded in different parts of the Roman world, some as far as India
and China.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Barnabas was a missionary apostle. He had the authority
to go out and form churches, recognize men with the spiritual gift of
pastor-teacher, train them, appoint them to certain local churches, and then to
move on. Acts 14:14; Gal. 2:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore
their robes and rushed out into the crowd, crying out”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 14:14,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and recognizing the grace that had been given to me, James and
Cephas and John, who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the
right hand of fellowship, so that we might go to the Gentiles and they to the
circumcised.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Galatians 2:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>James, the half-brother of Jesus Christ, was a missionary
apostle. He was the writer of the book of James. 1 Cor. 15:7; Gal. 1:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“then He appeared to James, then to all the apostles;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Corinthians 15:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But I did not see any other of the apostles except James, the
Lord’s brother.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Galatians 1:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Apollos was a missionary apostle and was Paul's delegate
to Corinth and appeared to also be an apostle in 1 Corinthians 4:6 and 1 Corinthians
4:9. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now these things, brethren, I have figuratively applied
to myself and Apollos for your sakes, so that in us you may learn not to exceed
what is written, so that no one of you will become arrogant in behalf of one
against the other.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 4:6, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For, I think, God has exhibited us apostles last of all,
as men condemned to death; because we have become a spectacle to the world,
both to angels and to men.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 4:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>Silvanas and Timothy also were
missionary apostles. Silvanas had a great ministry in witnessing and in the
field of music. Timothy did not often use his grace authority. 1 Thess. 1:1; 1
Thess. 2:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Paul and Silvanus and Timothy, To the church of the
Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and
peace.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Thessalonians 1:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“nor did we seek glory from men, either from you or from
others, even though as apostles of Christ we might have asserted our authority.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Thessalonians 2:6, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Other missionary apostles included Titus, Epaphroditus, Andronicus
and Junias. These men did not have the spiritual gift of Apostleship, but they
did have delegated authority to fulfill the missionary principle through the
establishment of local churches in different parts of the Roman world. 2 Cor.
8:23; Phil. 2:25; Rom. 16:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker among
you; as for our brethren, they are messengers of the churches, a glory to
Christ.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 8:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus,
my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger and
minister to my need;&quot;  (Philippians 2:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Greet Andronicus and Junias, my kinsmen and my fellow
prisoners, who are outstanding among the apostles, who also were in Christ
before me.&quot;  (Romans 16:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Cessation of the Gift of Apostleship</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is no perpetuation of the spiritual gift of Apostleship.
No sons became apostles. The temporary gift of Apostleship died with the Apostle
John. After his death, there were no more apostles. John is the last of the
apostles and died sometime between 96 and 100 AD, probably around 98 or 99 AD. John
finished writing the Book of the Revelation on the Isle of Patmos in 96 AD. He
then was released from his banishment on the Isle of Patmos and returned to
Asia Minor. John probably returned to the area of Ephesus as there was a
heretic by the name of Cerrinthus making inroads with his false doctrine in the
Church of Ephesus and he had to contend with that. Later on, a group of
apostates became carried away in their false doctrine, emotional behavior, and
demon doctrine such that they took John and boiled him in oil. John survived
this attempted murder. They couldn't kill him. This is a great example that you
are not going to die until it's God's time for you to die. When he finally did
die, he was the last apostle and it was the end of the gift of Apostleship.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The gift of Apostleship was absolute authority over all
the local churches in the Pre-canon period of the Church Age. Now, a similar
but more limited type of authority is delegated to the minister of the local
church by the Word of God and is resident in the pastor-teacher of one local church.
Following  the completion of the written Canon of Scripture, for the remainder
of the Church Age, every local church is autonomous, self-governing,
self-propagating and self-supporting. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If God wanted apostolic succession throughout the Church
Age, He would have made it very clear through His Word that this was a
permanent spiritual gift. He did not. The New Testament says nothing about the
gift of Apostleship going beyond the 12 apostles. When they died, that gift
died with them. Once the Canon of Scripture was complete with the writing of
the Book of the Revelation, the spiritual gift of Apostleship was withdrawn. </p>
