<h2><a name="_Adam"></a>Two Advents of Three Persons  </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Jesus Christ</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In His First Advent, Jesus Christ came to provide
salvation. He came to bring man something which was greater than that which man
had before in innocence. He came to solve the sinfulness of mankind which
originated with Satan.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In His Second Advent, Jesus Christ will return to the
earth and destroy all of His enemies and establish His Millennial Kingdom for 1,000
years of perfect environment.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Holy Spirit </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The First Advent of the Holy Spirit occurred on the Day
of Pentecost when God the Holy Spirit filled all Church Age believers for the
first time. The filling of the Holy Spirit provides in the believer (all of
whom represent Jesus Christ on earth) exactly what God the Son produced while
He walked, in His humanity, on the earth while being sustained by the Holy
Spirit. John 14:12 speaks of greater works in quantity, but the same in quality
and refers to the production of the Holy Spirit. John 16:7-­14 refers to the
Church Age.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works
that I do, he will do also; and greater works than these he will do; because I
go to the Father.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 14:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““But I tell you the truth, it is to your advantage that I go
away; for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but if I go, I
will send Him to you. “And He, when He comes, will convict the world concerning
sin and righteousness and judgment; concerning sin, because they do not believe
in Me; and concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father and you no
longer see Me; and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has
been judged. “I have many more things to say to you, but you cannot bear them
now. “But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all the
truth; for He will not speak on His own initiative, but whatever He hears, He
will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come. “He will glorify Me,
for He will take of Mine and will disclose it to you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John
16:7-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Second Advent of the Holy Spirit will occur in the
Millennium. In the Church Age, the Holy Spirit provides appreciation of Christ
on earth while Jesus Christ is absent. In the Millennium, Christ will be physically
present and visible on the earth and there will be a new type of spirituality. Joel
2:28-29; 2 Thess. 2:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>““It will come about after this That I will pour out My Spirit
on all mankind; And your sons and daughters will prophesy, Your old men will
dream dreams, Your young men will see visions. “Even on the male and female
servants I will pour out My Spirit in those days.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Joel 2:28-29,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only he who
now restrains will do so until he is taken out of the way.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2
Thessalonians 2:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Satan</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the First Advent of Satan, as chief of angels, he came
into perfect environment and destroyed it by changing it into sinfulness.
Genesis 1-3.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Second Advent of Satan will occur at the end of the Millennium
when Satan will be released and will immediately lead the Gog and Magog revolt
against Jesus Christ and will be utterly defeated. Jesus Christ will then send
him to the Lake of Fire for eternity. Rev. 20:7-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“When the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released
from his prison, and will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four
corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for the war; the
number of them is like the sand of the seashore. And they came up on the broad
plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city,
and fire came down from heaven and devoured them.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation
20:7-9, NASB)</p>
