<h2>Angelic Conflict, Enemies of The Lord Jesus Christ</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The enemies of Jesus Christ include Satan, fallen angels,
religion, believers out of fellowship, all unbelievers, and death. Heb. 1:13; Psalms
110:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But to which of the angels has He ever said, &quot;SIT AT
MY RIGHT HAND, UNTIL I MAKE YOUR ENEMIES A FOOTSTOOL FOR YOUR
FEET&quot;?&quot;  (Hebrews 1:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;A Psalm of David. The LORD says to my Lord: &quot;Sit at
My right hand Until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.&quot;&quot; 
(Psalms 110:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Hebrews 1:13 in the Greek quotes Psalms 110:1 in the
Hebrew. “Your enemies” in the Hebrew is the qal active participle of <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>איב</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>('âyab) which is declarative. In the Greek,
it is the present tense of <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>χθρο</span>́<span
lang=EL>ς</span> (echthros) which means keeps on being your enemy. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Satan and Fallen Angels.</b> Isaiah 14:13-14; Matt.
25:41; Rev. 20:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;But you said in your heart, 'I will ascend to
heaven; I will raise my throne above the stars of God, And I will sit on the
mount of assembly In the recesses of the north. 'I will ascend above the
heights of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.'&quot;  (Isaiah
14:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Then He will also say to those on His left, 'Depart
from Me, accursed ones, into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the
devil and his angels;&quot;  (Matthew 25:41, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake
of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also; and they
will be tormented day and night forever and ever.&quot;  (Revelation 20:10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Religion.</b> Religion is the enemy of God and is man
trying to make his good deeds acceptable to the perfect righteousness of God.
Christianity is not a religion, but a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
In Christianity, God seeks mankind through the salvation ministry of Jesus
Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Believers Out of Fellowship.</b> Believers whose
spiritual life has their soul controlled by their old sin nature are said to be
carnal and are called enemies of the Cross of Christ in Philippians 3:18. They
are no longer enemies positionally because they are in union with Jesus Christ,
but they are enemies of Christ in their spiritual life while out of
fellowship.  </p>

<p class=Verses> &quot;For many walk, of whom I often told you, and now tell
you even weeping, that they are enemies of the cross of Christ,&quot; 
(Philippians 3:18, NASB</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>All Unbelievers.</b> We are all born spiritually dead
with no way to gain a relationship with God except through the work of Jesus
Christ on the Cross. At birth, all in the human race except Jesus Christ are in
total separation from God and enemies of God. Rom. 5:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God
through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be
saved by His life.&quot;  (Romans 5:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Death.</b> Death will be abolished for the human race.
1 Cor. 15:26. Death is abolished for the unbeliever by being cast alive (in a
“resurrection unto damnation body”) into the Lake of Fire following the Great
White Throne Judgment. Rev. 20:14; Matt. 25:41. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The last enemy that will be abolished is death.&quot;  (1
Corinthians 15:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire.
This is the second death, the lake of fire.&quot;  (Revelation 20:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Then He will also say to those on His left, 'Depart
from Me, accursed ones, into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the
devil and his angels;&quot;  (Matthew 25:41, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Death is abolished for believers at their resurrection.
Rev. 21:4. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and
there will no longer be any death; there will no longer be any mourning, or
crying, or pain; the first things have passed away.&quot;&quot;  (Revelation
21:4, NASB)</p>
