<h2><a name="_D-Angelic_Conflict,_Satan’s"></a><a
name="_Angelic_Conflict,_Satan’s"></a>Angelic Conflict, Satan’s Strategies</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Satan’s Overall Strategy</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Revelation 12:9-10 and Zechariah 3:1-2, Satan is the
accuser. Satan in the Hebrew is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שׂטן</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(śâṭân) and in
the Greek <span lang=EL>δια</span>́<span lang=EL>βολος</span><span lang=EL> </span>(diabolos)
the devil. Both mean slanderer and accuser.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And the great dragon was thrown down, the serpent of old
who is called the devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was thrown
down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him. Then I heard a
loud voice in heaven, saying, &quot;Now the salvation, and the power, and the
kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ have come, for the accuser
of our brethren has been thrown down, he who accuses them before our God day
and night.&quot;  (Revelation 12:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before
the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him. The
LORD said to Satan, &quot;The LORD rebuke you, Satan! Indeed, the LORD who has
chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is this not a brand plucked from the
fire?&quot;&quot;  (Zechariah 3:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan strives to keep the believer away from the Word of
God. Gen. 3:1. 1 Chronicles 21:1 is an illustration of how Satan got David to
ignore the Word.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the
field which the LORD God had made. And he said to the woman, &quot;Indeed, has
God said, 'You shall not eat from any tree of the garden'?&quot;&quot; 
(Genesis 3:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then Satan stood up against Israel and moved David to
number Israel.&quot;  (1 Chronicles 21:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ephesians 6:11, “Schemes” is <span lang=EL>μεθοδει</span>́<span
lang=EL>α</span> (methodeia) and means strategies, methodology. We are to know
our enemy. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Put on the full armor of God, so that you will be able to
stand firm against the schemes of the devil.&quot;  (Ephesians 6:11, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 2:11, “Schemes” is <span lang=EL>νο</span>́<span
lang=EL>ημα</span> (noēma) and is sometimes translated thoughts, mind,
devices. Here it is translated schemes. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;so that no advantage would be taken of us by Satan, for
we are not ignorant of his schemes.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 2:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ephesians 6:12, “is not against flesh and blood” means
our personal contact with the enemy in the Angelic Conflict is not face to face
with human beings. Our contact is with the unseen fallen angelic army who have
targeted believers. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but
against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this
darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly
places.&quot;  (Ephesians 6:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Satan’s Counterfeits</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan has a regular system of counterfeit evangelists,
preachers, and apostles. 2 Cor. 11:13-15. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers,
disguising themselves as apostles of Christ. No wonder, for even Satan
disguises himself as an angel of light. Therefore it is not surprising if his
servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness, whose end will
be according to their deeds.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 11:13-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>These false evangelists preach a counterfeit gospel with
a system of salvation that Satan has concocted. Gal. 1:6-9; 2 Cor. 11:3-4. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I am amazed that you are so quickly deserting Him who
called you by the grace of Christ, for a different gospel; which is really not
another; only there are some who are disturbing you and want to distort the
gospel of Christ. But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you
a gospel contrary to what we have preached to you, he is to be accursed! As we
have said before, so I say again now, if any man is preaching to you a gospel
contrary to what you received, he is to be accursed!&quot;  (Galatians 1:6-9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But I am afraid that, as the serpent deceived Eve by his
craftiness, your minds will be led astray from the simplicity and purity of
devotion to Christ. For if one comes and preaches another Jesus whom we have
not preached, or you receive a different spirit which you have not received, or
a different gospel which you have not accepted, you bear this
beautifully.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 11:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan has a counterfeit system of doctrine. 1 Tim. 4:1-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some
will fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and
doctrines of demons, by means of the hypocrisy of liars seared in their own
conscience as with a branding iron, men who forbid marriage and advocate
abstaining from foods which God has created to be gratefully shared in by those
who believe and know the truth.&quot;  (1 Timothy 4:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan has a counterfeit communion table with idolatry of
an image representing man or animal or worship of things with no image such as money,
status, etc. 1 Cor. 10:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of
demons; you cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of
demons.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 10:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan has a counterfeit righteousness with a system of
morality and a system of religion. It is criticized and condemned in Matthew
23:27-28.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For
you are like whitewashed tombs which on the outside appear beautiful, but
inside they are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness. &quot;So you,
too, outwardly appear righteous to men, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy
and lawlessness.&quot;  (Matthew 23:27-28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan has a smoke screen to obscure the truth. 2 Cor.
4:3-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those
who are perishing, in whose case the god of this world has blinded the minds of
the unbelieving so that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory
of Christ, who is the image of God.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 4:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Satan’s Strategy Toward Adam &amp; Eve</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The issue in the Garden was whether Adam or Satan would
rule the world. Satan’s strategy was to deceive Eve and let her convince Adam
to join her in sin. Satan’s strategy of guile and deception worked. Satan used
his higher intelligence in the form of a serpent and deceived Eve through
conversation. Gen. 3:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the
field which the LORD God had made. And he said to the woman, &quot;Indeed, has
God said, 'You shall not eat from any tree of the garden'?&quot;&quot; 
(Genesis 3:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Eve demonstrated ignorance or failure to apply Bible
doctrine to her situation. She was gullible because she was short on doctrine.
When you deal with Satan biblically you do not need brains, you need Bible
doctrine in your soul. Gen. 3:2-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The woman said to the serpent, &quot;From the fruit of
the trees of the garden we may eat; but from the fruit of the tree which is in
the middle of the garden, God has said, 'You shall not eat from it or touch it,
or you will die.'&quot;&quot;  (Genesis 3:2-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan deceived through attacking verbal inspiration. Gen
2:17. God said nothing about touching the fruit, just eating it. She actually
misinterpreted God’s Word, misunderstood it, and then added to it. In Genesis
3:4, Satan contradicted God’s Word.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you
shall not eat, for in the day that you eat from it you will surely
die.&quot;&quot;  (Genesis 2:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The serpent said to the woman, &quot;You surely will not
die!&quot;  (Genesis 3:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan’s strategy also involved denying the connection
between sin and its punishment. In Genesis 2:17, God said from the Hebrew,
“Dying (spiritual death) you will die (physically).” Satan said in Genesis 3:4,
“Dying (spiritual death) you will not die (physically) you still go to heaven.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan deceived through religion in Genesis 3:5. Here was
an appeal to ego, to pride saying that you’ll be as smart as God! Satan fell in
the area of pride. Isaiah 14. Eve’s eyes were going to be opened, but she would
find out what God was like, not that she was like God. This is the deification
of man. There is nothing worse than religion because it puts man in the place
of God and man’s works in the place of grace.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;For God knows that in the day you eat from it your
eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and
evil.&quot;&quot;  (Genesis 3:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Eve was deceived through rationalization in Genesis 3:6.
She saw, but had not done anything yet. Eve had literally everything, yet she
wanted something else. Why? Human desire. This is an example of lust of the
eyes. 1 John 2:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and
the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life, is not from the Father,
but is from the world.&quot;  (1 John 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Another illustration is Solomon who always wanted more,
but became ever more miserable. Another illustration is that Americans have
more, but they are the most miserable people, most are superficial and shallow.
It is difficult to find an American who can carry on a conversation about
anything except sex, cars, jobs, sports, TV or movies. There is no bona fide
conversation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>But there is beauty and satisfaction in the Christian
life, inner peace, stability that no material thing can bring! No matter what
we have, there is always something else we want. You get that. You want
something else. The only way to handle this is by applying the <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine in your soul to life’s situations and choices. Stay in
fellowship. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Eve scrutinized (the lust of the eyes) and took a long
look at the fruit. She rationalized, “Why that does look good for food, I don’t
want that to go to waste, I’m willing to try anything once!” She was window
shopping in the orchard. She always stopped and looked at this tree, longed for
it and now she wanted it! Her final reasoning was “After all, it will increase
my wisdom, my understanding, and I’ll be like God.” So she took the fruit and
ate it. What was the penalty? Immediate spiritual death. It would also result
in her physical death much later.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan deceives through loved ones. Your own loved ones
help or hinder in large magnitude. Eve shared with her husband Adam and what
happened? He went along with his wife and men have been doing this ever since.
Gen. 3:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and
that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one
wise, she took from its fruit and ate; and she gave also to her husband with
her, and he ate.&quot;  (Genesis 3:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This sounds like it was written yesterday. Through
adjusting to each other without adjustment to God. They feel if they get right
with each other, they will be right with God. Gen. 3:7. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew
that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves
loin coverings.&quot;  (Genesis 3:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>People today say, “I’m going to heaven because I treat my
neighbor right, because I pay my debts, because I don’t beat my wife.” In other
words, I’m going to heaven because I’m properly adjusted to my fellow man. They
assume that adjustment with fellow members of the human race provides
adjustment with God. It does not. We must first be adjusted with God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan’s strategy involves hiding from the issues like an
ostrich with their head in the sand and not facing them. Gen. 3:8. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;They heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the
garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the
presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden.&quot;  (Genesis 3:8,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What makes a person hide from God? Not seeing the issue?
The unbeliever doesn’t see because they are spiritually dead. A believer under
conviction is out of fellowship. Gen. 3:10. When a man gets into a tight spot
like this, then it is always someone else’s fault. They try to pass the buck.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He said, &quot;I heard the sound of You in the garden,
and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid myself.&quot;&quot;  (Genesis
3:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><a name="_Satan’s_Angelic_Infiltration"></a><b>Satan’s
Angelic Infiltration of the Human Race</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Angels are invisible except when God permits them to
become visible and to take on human form. For example, the angel Gabriel taught
Daniel. Two visible angels also destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are four civilizations in human history. The
Antediluvian Civilization that existed before the Great Flood. The Postdiluvian
Civilization that existed after the Great Flood. The Millennial Civilization
that will exist following the Tribulation and will be a literal 1,000 years.
Then there will be the Eternal Civilization. Rev. 21-22.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Antediluvian Civilization (before the flood),
there was a tremendous concentration of fallen angels lead by Satan in a great
attempt to dilute the human race DNA with angelic DNA, thus preventing Jesus
Christ from being perfect mankind and perfect God in one person. The first
reference to the salvation work of Jesus Christ was declared in Genesis 3:15
and is called the “Proto-Evangel.” This really bothered Satan.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And I will put enmity Between you and the woman, And
between your seed and her seed; He shall bruise you on the head, And you shall
bruise him on the heel.&quot;&quot;  (Genesis 3:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One of his attempts to keep Jesus Christ from coming into
the human race through a true human mother is recorded in Genesis 6:1-6. We
assume that this was Satan’s motive for the Genesis 6 infiltration into the
human race.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 6:1-2, “men” refers to homo sapiens,
“daughters” refers to a situation on earth where there were more females than
men, and “sons of God” is <i>beni ha elohim</i> in the Hebrew and refers to
angels, never to mankind. Job 1:6; Job 2:1; Job 38:7. These three verses use
the same Hebrew word. In the context of Genesis 6:1-2, these are fallen angels.
The term “Son of God” refers to Jesus Christ and “sons of God” in the New
Testament refers to believers. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now it came about, when men began to multiply on the face
of the land, and daughters were born to them, that the sons of God saw that the
daughters of men were beautiful; and they took wives for themselves, whomever
they chose.&quot;  (Genesis 6:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present
themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them.&quot;  (Job 1:6,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Again there was a day when the sons of God came to
present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them to present
himself before the LORD.&quot;  (Job 2:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When the morning stars sang together And all the sons of
God shouted for joy?&quot;  (Job 38:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Took wives” means angelic volition was involved. “Wives”
is plural meaning that most had more than one. This may sound weird to you, but
it doesn’t to human history. Norse, Greek and Latin contain accounts of Zeus,
Pericles, Castor, and Pollox - gods (angels) marrying women and resulting in
angel-human offspring. Cohabitation of fallen angels and human women was the
beginning of Satan’s plan. “Marriage” in the angelic realm was stopped after
this as a judgment from God as now angels are not married nor given in
marriage. Matt. 22:30.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are
given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.&quot;  (Matthew 22:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Apparently angels, even though a superior type of
creation, procreated in a manner similar to members of the human race and just
as animals (a lower creation) procreate and reproduce their own kind.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan’s master plan to cut off the Cross was to
infiltrate the human race with some angelic males finding human females and
procreating, thereby developing a race that was no longer true homo sapiens.
Noah’s line remained true humanity. Genesis 6:9. The rest of the human race was
infiltrated by angels which resulted in supermen such as Hercules, Atlas,
Castor, and Pollox.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;These are the records of the generations of Noah. Noah
was a righteous man, blameless in his time; Noah walked with God.&quot; 
(Genesis 6:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s reaction to Satan’s plot is found in Genesis 6:3.
“My Spirit” refers to the Holy Spirit. “Shall not strive” means to make the
Gospel clear to the unbeliever who is spiritually dead. John 16:7-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then the LORD said, &quot;My Spirit shall not strive with
man forever, because he also is flesh; nevertheless his days shall be one
hundred and twenty years.&quot;&quot;  (Genesis 6:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;But I tell you the truth, it is to your advantage
that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but
if I go, I will send Him to you. &quot;And He, when He comes, will convict the
world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment; concerning sin, because
they do not believe in Me; and concerning righteousness, because I go to the
Father and you no longer see Me; and concerning judgment, because the ruler of
this world has been judged.&quot;  (John 16:7-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Flesh” means true humanity. Mankind is under attack from
Satan to contaminate the human DNA with angelic DNA, thus preventing the
arrival of the Savior Jesus Christ as both true humanity and true deity in one person.
The reference to 120 years means that at the end of that time there would be no
pure uncontaminated humans remaining except for Noah and his family. All others
had some angelic DNA in them. They had heard the Gospel for 120 years. For 120
years, the Holy Spirit evangelized through various people such as Enoch,
Methuselah, and Noah. The only people who accepted Christ as their Savior were
eight humans who remained true humanity and were in the Ark starting the new
civilization - the Postdiluvian Civilization.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Result of the Infiltration of Angels</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 6:4, ”The Nephilim” were human fallen and
corrupt ones – the half-human, half-angelic creatures from the union of angel
and human. They had fallen from the human race. They were not true humanity. “The
mighty men who were of old, men of renown” refers to the heroes and supermen of
Greek and Roman mythology such as Perseus, Dionysus, Hercules, Apollo, Jason,
Pollux, Prometheus, and Castor. The Nephilim had great strength and had much
higher intelligence than humans.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also
afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore
children to them. Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of
renown.&quot;  (Genesis 6:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 6:5, “wickedness of man” refers to a
concentration of wickedness along with the destruction of true humanity. “His
heart” refers to the right lobe of the soul. Mental attitude sins are the
greatest source of wickedness.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then the LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great on
the earth, and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil
continually.&quot;  (Genesis 6:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s observation and decision was to destroy all humans
and Nephilim by drowning except for Noah and his family. The reason Noah and
his family didn’t get involved is because they were true humanity and born
again. The rest were very warlike and brutal and prone to fighting, drinking,
singing, hunting, and copulating. That was their life. Gen. 6:6-7; Gen. 6:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The LORD was sorry that He had made man on the earth, and
He was grieved in His heart. The LORD said, &quot;I will blot out man whom I
have created from the face of the land, from man to animals to creeping things
and to birds of the sky; for I am sorry that I have made them.&quot;&quot; 
(Genesis 6:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;God looked on the earth, and behold, it was corrupt; for
all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth.&quot;  (Genesis 6:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It’s important that Noah can trace his genealogy back to
Adam minus angelic infiltration. “Found favor” means salvation. Noah and his
family were believers – the only believers remaining on the earth at that time.
In Genesis 6:9, “righteous” means Noah was justified. “Blameless in his time”
refers to true humanity. “Walked with God” refers to post-salvation spiritual
growth – he walked in fellowship with God. Gen. 6:8-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD. These are
the records of the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless in
his time; Noah walked with God.&quot;  (Genesis 6:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>So what happened to the Nephilim? We know the super race
couldn’t outswim the Great Flood, so they drowned. Also, what happened to the
fallen angels that had sex with human women and produced the Nephilim? These
demons are not operative now. These fallen angels remain imprisoned in a
section of Hades called “Tartarus” because of their attack on the virgin birth,
the humanity of our Lord. 1 Peter 3:19-22; 2 Peter 2:4-5. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Jude 1:6, some of the fallen angels refused to stay in
their abode designated by God. They are the ones who mingled with the human
race on earth. They remain in total darkness without contact with any other
creatures until they are released in the middle of the Tribulation. Their
ultimate fate is the “judgment of the great day” or the eternal Lake of Fire.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And angels who did not keep their own domain, but
abandoned their proper abode, He has kept in eternal bonds under darkness for
the judgment of the great day,&quot;  (Jude 1:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus said in the Gospels that angels neither are married
or given in marriage. This was true when he spoke. It is an idiom for loss of
sexual capability. Before Genesis 6, the fallen angels could cohabit and
procreate. After Genesis 6, fallen angels can inhabit the earth, they can
engage in demon possession of unbelievers, but they cannot have sex with humans
and procreation is not possible.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Peter 3:18, Christ bore our sins and was resurrected
from the dead. “Made alive in the spirit” refers to the Holy Spirit who
provided the power to resurrect Jesus Christ. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For Christ also died for sins once for all, the just for
the unjust, so that He might bring us to God, having been put to death in the
flesh, but made alive in the spirit;&quot;  (1 Peter 3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Peter 3:19, Jesus Christ was transported to Tartarus
to make the Victorious Proclamation. “Spirits” are the fallen angels who
infiltrated the humanity of the Antediluvian Civilization. Remember, the
confined fallen angels were in complete darkness with no contact with Satan or
Christ or life on earth. Christ tells them in the Victorious Proclamation that
even though Satan tried to frustrate God’s plan, Jesus Christ being true
sinless humanity and perfect deity in one person forever had been judged on the
Cross for the sins of all mankind and the justice of God the Father had been
satisfied. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;in which also He went and made proclamation to the
spirits now in prison,&quot;  (1 Peter 3:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Peter 3:20, the fallen angels were disobedient to
the divine command which prohibits sexual activity between different categories
of creation. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;who once were disobedient, when the patience of God kept
waiting in the days of Noah, during the construction of the ark, in which a
few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through the water.&quot;  (1
Peter 3:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Who once” is an adverb referring to Genesis 6:1-11.
“Safely” is <span lang=EL>διασω</span>́<span lang=EL>ζω</span> (diasōzō) not
sodzo. This is a deliverance through some agency. Eight souls were brought to a
place of safety. “Through the water” is literally translated and this is actual
water. This water is judgment to the unregenerate and the instrument of deliverance
to the believer. The believers were believers before they ever got on the ark.
This is not analogous to baptism.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The analogy of the Ark is found in 1 Peter 3:21. “Corresponding
to that” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>ντι</span>́<span lang=EL>τυπον</span>
(antitupon) refers to the antitype, the baptism of the Holy Spirit, the means
of Positional Truth. “Baptism now saves you” refers to baptism of the Holy
Spirit because the only water around is that which gets rid of unbelievers. Many
people see the word “baptism” and they immediately think of water baptism. Water
baptism is not involved here. This is baptism by the Holy Spirit. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Corresponding to that, baptism now saves you—not the
removal of dirt from the flesh, but an appeal to God for a good
conscience—through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,&quot;  (1 Peter 3:21,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Not the removal of dirt from the flesh” literally means
this is not taking a bath, not water baptism. “But an appeal” is <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span
lang=EL>περω</span>́<span lang=EL>τημα</span> (eperōtēma) and means a pledge
of a good conscience toward God. This is faith alone in Jesus Christ alone for
salvation resulting in the Baptism of the Spirit and union with Christ. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 Peter 3:22 speaks of the ascension and session of our
Lord Jesus Christ at the right hand of God the Father. “Angels and authorities
and powers” should be translated, angels, both demons and Satanic powers being
subordinated to His humanity. Psalms 110:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven,
after angels and authorities and powers had been subjected to Him.&quot;  (1
Peter 3:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;A Psalm of David. The LORD says to my Lord: &quot;Sit at
My right hand Until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.&quot;&quot; 
(Psalms 110:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>2 Peter 2:4-5 speaks of God’s judgment of the fallen
angels involved and the resulting destruction of all Nephilim on the earth.
These fallen angels were cast into Tartarus in Hades awaiting final judgment in
the Lake of Fire. They continue to be in this angelic prison until the middle
of the Tribulation at which time Satan is cast down to the earth (denied access
to heaven) and the events of Revelation 9:1-11 where demons are released from
the angelic hell called the bottomless pit. Their ultimate fate still will be
the Lake of Fire at the end of the Millennium.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but
cast them into hell and committed them to pits of darkness, reserved for
judgment; and did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a preacher
of righteousness, with seven others, when He brought a flood upon the world of
the ungodly;&quot;  (2 Peter 2:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Never sell the grace of God short. God will change human
history to keep His promises! God never walks away from an obligation. Isaiah
53:5-6 says He was obligated to die for the human race once the promise of a
Savior was given in Genesis 3:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But He was pierced through for our transgressions, He was
crushed for our iniquities; The chastening for our well-being fell upon Him,
And by His scourging we are healed. All of us like sheep have gone astray, Each
of us has turned to his own way; But the LORD has caused the iniquity of us all
To fall on Him.&quot;  (Isaiah 53:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And I will put enmity Between you and the woman, And
between your seed and her seed; He shall bruise you on the head, And you shall
bruise him on the heel.&quot;&quot;  (Genesis 3:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Satan’s Strategy to Oppose Jesus Christ </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The world system of Satan opposes all believers and
anything to do with the plan of God or God's grace. Satan knows he cannot
attack the sovereignty of God, so he attacks the volition of mankind. The
greatest attack on human volition occurred against the humanity of Jesus Christ
when He was on earth. He was attacked constantly and was tempted beyond
anything we will ever know. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Few groups in history have had greater opposition to
Jesus Christ and God’s grace plan of salvation than the Scribes and Pharisees.
Those in opposition were consistently anti-authority. They were astonished at
Christ’s authority and the content of His words in Matthew 7:24, Matthew
22:29-33, John 7:46, and Luke 4:32.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;Therefore everyone who hears these words of Mine
and acts on them, may be compared to a wise man who built his house on the
rock. &quot;  (Matthew 7:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But Jesus answered and said to them, &quot;You are
mistaken, not understanding the Scriptures nor the power of God. &quot;For in
the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like
angels in heaven. &quot;But regarding the resurrection of the dead, have you
not read what was spoken to you by God: 'I AM THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, AND THE GOD
OF ISAAC, AND THE GOD OF JACOB'? He is not the God of the dead but of the
living.&quot; When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at His
teaching.&quot;  (Matthew 22:29-33, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The officers answered, &quot;Never has a man spoken the
way this man speaks.&quot;&quot;  (John 7:46, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and they were amazed at His teaching, for His message was
with authority.&quot;  (Luke 4:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They questioned our Lord’s authority in Mark 11:27-28.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;They came again to Jerusalem. And as He was walking in
the temple, the chief priests and the scribes and the elders came to Him, and
began saying to Him, &quot;By what authority are You doing these things, or who
gave You this authority to do these things?&quot;&quot;  (Mark 11:27-28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Pharisees were frustrated by His authority in Matthew
21:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When He entered the temple, the chief priests and the
elders of the people came to Him while He was teaching, and said, &quot;By what
authority are You doing these things, and who gave You this
authority?&quot;&quot;  (Matthew 21:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Pharisees’ opposition to the spoken Word was caused
by their even deeper opposition to the written Word. John 5:45-47.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;Do not think that I will accuse you before the
Father; the one who accuses you is Moses, in whom you have set your hope.
&quot;For if you believed Moses, you would believe Me, for he wrote about Me.
&quot;But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe My
words?&quot; &quot;  (John 5:45-47, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Opposition to the content of a communicator of Bible
doctrine leads to opposition of the communicator Himself. John 8:42-47.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Jesus said to them, &quot;If God were your Father, you
would love Me, for I proceeded forth and have come from God, for I have not
even come on My own initiative, but He sent Me. &quot;Why do you not understand
what I am saying? It is because you cannot hear My word. &quot;You are of your
father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a
murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth because there is
no truth in him. Whenever he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own nature, for
he is a liar and the father of lies. &quot;But because I speak the truth, you
do not believe Me. &quot;Which one of you convicts Me of sin? If I speak truth,
why do you not believe Me? &quot;He who is of God hears the words of God; for
this reason you do not hear them, because you are not of God.&quot; &quot; 
(John 8:42-47, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They opposed John the Baptist for not eating or drinking
in Matthew 11:18. </p>

<p class=Verses> &quot; &quot;For John came neither eating nor drinking, and
they say, 'He has a demon!' &quot;  (Matthew 11:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Pharisees opposed Jesus Christ for associating with
those who they felt were undesirables in Matthew 11:19. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they
say, 'Behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and
sinners!' Yet wisdom is vindicated by her deeds.&quot; &quot;  (Matthew 11:19,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Pharisees opposed Jesus Christ in every possible way.
In Matthew 12:24, they oppose Him as to His credentials.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, &quot;This
man casts out demons only by Beelzebul the ruler of the demons.&quot;&quot; 
(Matthew 12:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Satan’s Strategies Toward Unbelievers </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Church Age, Satan and his demons attack
unbelievers by either demon possession or demon influence. In demon possession,
the demon actually indwells the unbeliever’s body. In demon influence, demon
doctrines enter the soul of the unbeliever to cause their change in thinking
and behavior. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan and his fallen angels blind the unbeliever’s mind
so they will reject the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 2 Cor. 4:3-4; 2 Thess. 2:9-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those
who are perishing, in whose case the god of this world has blinded the minds of
the unbelieving so that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory
of Christ, who is the image of God.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 4:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;that is, the one whose coming is in accord with the
activity of Satan, with all power and signs and false wonders, and with all the
deception of wickedness for those who perish, because they did not receive the
love of the truth so as to be saved.&quot;  (2 Thessalonians 2:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He convinces man to deify and glorify mankind just as he
did himself at his fall. He promotes man’s ability as the only solution to
man’s problems without any help from God. His ace trump is religion. Religion
is the super-blinder and opposes the grace plan of God. Religious
internationalism is the worst. Isaiah 14:14; Gen. 3; Col. 2:8; Luke 8:12. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;'I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will
make myself like the Most High.'&quot;  (Isaiah 14:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;See to it that no one takes you captive through
philosophy and empty deception, according to the tradition of men, according to
the elementary principles of the world, rather than according to Christ.&quot; 
(Colossians 2:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Those beside the road are those who have heard;
then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart, so that they
will not believe and be saved.&quot;  (Luke 8:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Blindness is a satanic activity by which the perceptive
and norm and standard lobe is influenced, promoting darkness, snatching away
the seed of the Gospel, enticing to mental attitude sins with the result of
scar tissue in the soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan has a strategy regarding nations. The key word is
“deceive.” Rev. 20:3; Rev. 20:8; Rev. 12:9. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and he threw him into the abyss, and shut it and sealed
it over him, so that he would not deceive the nations any longer, until the
thousand years were completed; after these things he must be released for a
short time.&quot;  (Revelation 20:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and will come out to deceive the nations which are in the
four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for the war;
the number of them is like the sand of the seashore.&quot;  (Revelation 20:8,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And the great dragon was thrown down, the serpent of old
who is called the devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was thrown
down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.&quot;  (Revelation
12:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan seeks to knock out the four Divine Institutions in
the thinking of both unbelievers and believers. Gen. 2-11. This is being done
by ignorance of what the Divine Institutions really are. Satan deceives by
promoting militant, atheistic crusades against them, by substitutes for them in
brotherhood organizations, human panaceas, and world citizenship emphasis.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You should understand the doctrines of the four Divine
Institutions, the four generation family curse, the five cycles of discipline,
the doctrine of war, morality vs. human good, the doctrine of depression, the
doctrine of revolution, crime, immorality, lawlessness, and the doctrine of
legalism.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Satan’s Strategies to Oppose Believers</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Church Age, Satan and his demons can attack
believers only by demon influence. A believer cannot be indwelt by a demon
because all Church Age believers are indwelt by God the Father, God the Son as
the Shekinah Glory, and God the Holy Spirit. In demon influence, demon
doctrines enter the soul of the believer to cause their change in thinking and
behavior. 1 Tim. 4:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some
will fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and
doctrines of demons, by means of the hypocrisy of liars seared in their own
conscience as with a branding iron,&quot;  (1 Timothy 4:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan’s basic motive is to get believers involved in and
ensnared with anything but Bible doctrine. It really doesn’t matter to him as
long as the believer fails to grow spiritually and ideally retrogresses to
reversionism to become an enemy of God. 1 Tim. 3:7;  2 Tim. 2:25; 1 Tim. 6:9. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And he must have a good reputation with those outside the
church, so that he will not fall into reproach and the snare of the
devil.&quot;  (1 Timothy 3:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;with gentleness correcting those who are in opposition,
if perhaps God may grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the
truth,&quot;  (2 Timothy 2:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a
snare and many foolish and harmful desires which plunge men into ruin and
destruction.&quot;  (1 Timothy 6:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Timothy 2:26, “snare” is <span lang=EL>παγι</span>́<span
lang=EL>ς</span> (pagis) and means a trap, a trick, a stratagem. <i>Pagis</i>
is from <span lang=EL>πη</span>́<span lang=EL>γνυμι</span> (pēgnumi) meaning
to fix, to make fast, to peg, to setup.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and they may come to their senses and escape from the
snare of the devil, having been held captive by him to do his will.&quot;  (2
Timothy 2:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In heaven, Satan accuses believers who are doing the work
of the Lord on earth. Satan has access to heaven. The believer’s defense
attorney is the Lord Jesus Christ who continually intercedes for us as our High
Priest. In Job 1:6 is an accusation before the throne of grace by Satan. 2 Cor.
2:11; 1 John 3:l.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present
themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them.&quot;  (Job 1:6,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“so that no advantage would be taken of us by Satan, for we are
not ignorant of his schemes.” (2 Corinthians 2:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“See how great a love the Father has bestowed on us, that we
would be called children of God; and such we are. For this reason the world
does not know us, because it did not know Him.” (1 John 3:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan deceives believers and gets them to accuse other
believers. In Titus 2:3 and 2 Timothy 3:3, they are the “malicious gossips.” </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Older women likewise are to be reverent in their
behavior, not malicious gossips nor enslaved to much wine, teaching what is
good,&quot;  (Titus 2:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;unloving, irreconcilable, malicious gossips, without
self-control, brutal, haters of good,&quot;  (2 Timothy 3:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Will of God</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan deceives believers to ignore the viewpoint will of
God. God wants the believer to think with divine viewpoint in their soul and
remain in fellowship a maximum amount of the time. Satan wants the believer to
stay with human viewpoint in carnality. Isaiah 55:7-9; Prov. 23:7; 2 Cor. 10:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And the great dragon was thrown down, the serpent of old
who is called the devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was thrown
down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.&quot;  (Revelation
12:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For as he thinks within himself, so he is. He says to
you, &quot;Eat and drink!&quot; But his heart is not with you.&quot;  (Proverbs
23:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;We are destroying speculations and every lofty thing
raised up against the knowledge of God, and we are taking every thought captive
to the obedience of Christ,&quot;  (2 Corinthians 10:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan deceives believers to ignore the operational will
of God. Satan hinders the believer in their spiritual growth and tries to keep
them out of fellowship. Gal. 5:7; James 4:7-8.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;You were running well; who hindered you from obeying the
truth?&quot;  (Galatians 5:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Submit therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will
flee from you. Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your
hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded.&quot;  (James
4:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan deceives believers to ignore the geographical will
of God just as he did with Paul’s missionary team in 1 Thessalonians 2:18.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For we wanted to come to you—I, Paul, more than once—and
yet Satan hindered us.&quot;  (1 Thessalonians 2:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan wants to keep believers apart by divisions and from
being like-minded in Bible doctrine. Satan seeks to get the eyes of the
believer off of the Lord Jesus Christ by obscuring the focus of the believer.
He seeks to get the believer to focus on self.  Examples are Elijah in 1 Kings
19:10, 1 Corinthians 1:10-11 and Genesis 3:4-5 and Peter in Matthew 26:31-35. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now I exhort you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ, that you all agree and that there be no divisions among you, but that
you be made complete in the same mind and in the same judgment. For I have been
informed concerning you, my brethren, by Chloe's people, that there are
quarrels among you.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 1:10-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He said, &quot;I have been very zealous for the LORD, the
God of hosts; for the sons of Israel have forsaken Your covenant, torn down
Your altars and killed Your prophets with the sword. And I alone am left; and
they seek my life, to take it away.&quot;&quot;  (1 Kings 19:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Jesus said to them, &quot;You will all fall away because
of Me this night, for it is written, 'I WILL STRIKE DOWN THE SHEPHERD, AND THE
SHEEP OF THE FLOCK SHALL BE SCATTERED.' &quot;But after I have been raised, I
will go ahead of you to Galilee.&quot; But Peter said to Him, &quot;Even though
all may fall away because of You, I will never fall away.&quot; Jesus said to
him, &quot;Truly I say to you that this very night, before a rooster crows, you
will deny Me three times.&quot; Peter said to Him, &quot;Even if I have to die
with You, I will not deny You.&quot; All the disciples said the same thing
too.” (Matthew 26:31-35, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan wants you to get your eyes on materialistic things
or the details of life as the means of happiness instead of focus on Jesus
Christ and His Word. The details of life include money, success, social life,
pleasure, friends, loved ones, health, sex, status symbols, and materialistic
things. With the grace apparatus for perception, you can enjoy the details of
life. Otherwise, the details of life lead the believer on a merry chase and
make them miserable. Heb. 13:5-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Make sure that your character is free from the love of
money, being content with what you have; for He Himself has said, &quot;I WILL
NEVER DESERT YOU, NOR WILL I EVER FORSAKE YOU,&quot; so that we confidently
say, &quot;THE LORD IS MY HELPER, I WILL NOT BE AFRAID. WHAT WILL MAN DO TO
ME?&quot;&quot;  (Hebrews 13:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan encourages believers to worry. 1 Peter 5:8-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Be of sober spirit, be on the alert. Your adversary, the
devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour. But resist
him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same experiences of suffering are
being accomplished by your brethren who are in the world.&quot;  (1 Peter
5:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He seeks to get the believer to focus on trusting people
and by exhibiting admiration and jealousy of other people. Jer. 17:5. The answer
can be found in Hebrews 12:2 and Colossians 3:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Thus says the LORD, &quot;Cursed is the man who trusts in
mankind And makes flesh his strength, And whose heart turns away from the
LORD.&quot;  (Jeremiah 17:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of
faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame,
and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.&quot;  (Hebrews 12:2,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore if you have been raised up with Christ, keep seeking
the things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your
mind on the things above, not on the things that are on earth.” (Colossians
3:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan wants you to get your eyes on other people. 1 Cor.
3:6-7; 1 Cor. 3:11. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing the
growth. So then neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything,
but God who causes the growth.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 3:6-7, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For no man can lay a foundation other than the one which
is laid, which is Jesus Christ.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 3:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan instills the fear of death in believers. Heb.
2:14-15; Job 5:21; Psalms 23:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood, He
Himself likewise also partook of the same, that through death He might render powerless
him who had the power of death, that is, the devil, and might free those who
through fear of death were subject to slavery all their lives.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews
2:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;You will be hidden from the scourge of the tongue,
And you will not be afraid of violence when it comes.&quot;  (Job 5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of
death, I fear no evil, for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they
comfort me.&quot;  (Psalms 23:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan strives to confuse the believer on dispensations
and how God administers them differently, but always with salvation and
spiritual growth provided through His grace provision. Satan would like every
believer to have a guilt complex so they will stay out of fellowship. 2 Tim. 3:6-7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For among them are those who enter into households and
captivate weak women weighed down with sins, led on by various impulses, always
learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.&quot;  (2
Timothy 3:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan opposes your daily intake of Bible doctrine and use
of the grace apparatus for perception so that you will never succeed in
building the edification complex in your soul. He wants you to select the wrong
person to marry and for the wrong reasons. Satan wants to get believers mixed
up on creation, intellectualism, making academics the end of all pursuits, and
the use of rationalism and empiricism as the criteria for belief. He wants the
believer ignorant of Bible doctrine and its divine inspiration so they cannot
apply doctrine to their problems in life and to their experiences. Gen. 3:2-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The woman said to the serpent, &quot;From the fruit of
the trees of the garden we may eat; but from the fruit of the tree which is in
the middle of the garden, God has said, 'You shall not eat from it or touch it,
or you will die.'&quot;&quot;  (Genesis 3:2-3, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan invites believers to ignore the Word and accept
false doctrine. Satan gets believers occupied with the temporal solution to man’s
problems and to neglect divine solutions. 1 Tim. 4:1; 1 Cor. 10:19-20; 2 Cor.
11:3; 2 Cor. 11:13-15; 1 Chron. 21:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some
will fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and
doctrines of demons,&quot;  (1 Timothy 4:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“What do I mean then? That a thing sacrificed to idols is
anything, or that an idol is anything? No, but I say that the things which the
Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God; and I do not want
you to become sharers in demons.” (1 Corinthians 10:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But I am afraid that, as the serpent deceived Eve by his
craftiness, your minds will be led astray from the simplicity and purity of
devotion to Christ.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 11:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising
themselves as apostles of Christ. No wonder, for even Satan disguises himself
as an angel of light. Therefore it is not surprising if his servants also
disguise themselves as servants of righteousness, whose end will be according
to their deeds.” (2 Corinthians 11:13-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Satan stood up against Israel and moved David to number
Israel.” (1 Chronicles 21:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan definitely wants to keep you ignorant of his methods
of deceit. 2 Cor. 2:11.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i><span style='color:blue'>&quot;so that no advantage
would be taken of us by Satan, for we are not ignorant of his schemes.&quot; 
(2 Corinthians 2:11, NASB)</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He wants the believer to be occupied with him as the
cause of all problems. The “It must be the devil” syndrome. Gen. 3:1. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the
field which the LORD God had made. And he said to the woman, &quot;Indeed, has
God said, 'You shall not eat from any tree of the garden'?&quot;&quot; 
(Genesis 3:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan wants the believer to deny the connection between
sin and its punishment. Gen. 3:4.</p>

<p class=Verses> &quot;The serpent said to the woman, &quot;You surely will not
die!&quot;  (Genesis 3:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan wants the believer to choose religion instead of
emphasizing the personal relationship that belief in Jesus Christ for salvation
brings and what spiritual growth through intake and application of Bible
doctrine brings. Satan is always behind the “religion of man” and its
infiltration into the Angelic Conflict. Religion among men is the greatest
success of fallen angels in the Angelic Conflict. Gen. 3:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;For God knows that in the day you eat from it your
eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and
evil.&quot;&quot;  (Genesis 3:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He deceives believers into using rationalization instead
of faith and application of Bible doctrine. In Genesis 3:6, Eve saw, she
scrutinized, then she took the fruit. Satan also deceives believers through
loved ones. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and
that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one
wise, she took from its fruit and ate; and she gave also to her husband with
her, and he ate.&quot;  (Genesis 3:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan opposes the believer by deceiving them into
believing they can adjust to other people without any adjustment to God. Gen.
3:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew
that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves
loin coverings.&quot;  (Genesis 3:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He wants believers to hide from the issues by not facing
them. In Genesis 3:8, Adam had become an unbeliever.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;They heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the
garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the
presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden.&quot;  (Genesis 3:8,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan opposes the believer by convincing them that it is
better to pass the buck than to take responsibility for their decisions. Gen.
3:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He said, &quot;I heard the sound of You in the garden,
and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid myself.&quot;&quot;  (Genesis
3:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He opposes the believer through keeping them occupied
with examples of where believers in the Bible failed, but neglecting to mention
how God's grace provision turned those failures into spiritually mature
believers that had a great impact on those around them and within the plan of
God. The life of Moses is a good example of this. In Exodus 2:11-12 and Acts
7:23-24, Moses took it upon himself to remedy an injustice by vengeance apart
from the plan of God. Moses then left Egypt for Midian where he spent 40 years
learning Bible doctrine and the plan God had for him. Heb. 11:24-27; Exodus
2:15. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now it came about in those days, when Moses had grown up,
that he went out to his brethren and looked on their hard labors; and he saw an
Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his brethren. So he looked this way and that,
and when he saw there was no one around, he struck down the Egyptian and hid
him in the sand.&quot;  (Exodus 2:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;But when he was approaching the age of forty, it
entered his mind to visit his brethren, the sons of Israel. &quot;And when he
saw one of them being treated unjustly, he defended him and took vengeance for
the oppressed by striking down the Egyptian.&quot;  (Acts 7:23-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be
called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, choosing rather to endure ill-treatment
with the people of God than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin, considering
the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he was
looking to the reward. By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the
king; for he endured, as seeing Him who is unseen.&quot;  (Hebrews 11:24-27,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When Pharaoh heard of this matter, he tried to kill
Moses. But Moses fled from the presence of Pharaoh and settled in the land of
Midian, and he sat down by a well.&quot;  (Exodus 2:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan opposes the believer by attempting to deter them
through false teachers that teach contrary to the Word of God or teach a system
of works that they do not even follow. 2 Peter 2:1-3; Rom. 2:17-24; Matt.
23:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But false prophets also arose among the people, just as
there will also be false teachers among you, who will secretly introduce
destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing swift
destruction upon themselves. Many will follow their sensuality, and because of
them the way of the truth will be maligned; and in their greed they will
exploit you with false words; their judgment from long ago is not idle, and
their destruction is not asleep.&quot;  (2 Peter 2:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites,
because you shut off the kingdom of heaven from people; for you do not enter in
yourselves, nor do you allow those who are entering to go in. &quot;  (Matthew
23:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>False teachers also oppose God's plan by creating more
followers like themselves through their false teaching.  Matt. 23:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites,
because you travel around on sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he
becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves. &quot; 
(Matthew 23:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Those that oppose the believer are the first to criticize
and the last to be constructive. Matt. 23:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;They tie up heavy burdens and lay them on men's
shoulders, but they themselves are unwilling to move them with so much as a
finger. &quot;  (Matthew 23:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They are eager to hassle others over trivial matters and
omit the real spiritual issues of God’s justice, mercy and faithfulness. Matt.
23:23. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For
you tithe mint and dill and cummin, and have neglected the weightier provisions
of the law: justice and mercy and faithfulness; but these are the things you
should have done without neglecting the others. &quot;  (Matthew 23:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They are eager for external status recognition, but short
on inner character. In Matthew 23:25, “robbery” is ἁρπαγή (harpagē) in the
Greek and means extortion, seizing of booty for personal gain and personal
gratification. “Self-indulgence” is ἀκρασία (akrasia) and means excess, lack
of self-control, inability to restrain yourself from profiteering.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For
you clean the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside they are full of
robbery and self-indulgence. &quot;  (Matthew 23:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Those that oppose God's grace plan for salvation will
object to the moral rights of others. They will object to the community rights
of others. They will object to the spiritual rights of others. They will object
to the Gospel. They will object to teaching for edification. They will object
to the local church. They will object to the expression of divine viewpoint.
They will oppose you as you grow spiritually.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan uses the emotional crowd who emphasize the false
use of temporary spiritual gifts that ceased to function prior to 96 AD. Many
are involved in the emotions of tongues, casting out demons, and healing. These
people have become neutralized in the Angelic Conflict. When emotionalism take
precedence over doctrine, it dilutes doctrine. Emotionalism is never bona fide.
We have emotions and they are given to appreciate the Word. The filling of the
Spirit has nothing to do with emotion. Rom. 16:17-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now I urge you, brethren, keep your eye on those who
cause dissensions and hindrances contrary to the teaching which you learned,
and turn away from them. For such men are slaves, not of our Lord Christ but of
their own appetites; and by their smooth and flattering speech they deceive the
hearts of the unsuspecting.&quot;  (Romans 16:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan also uses the program crowd in local churches that
make such programs a higher priority than learning Bible doctrine. They have no
impact in the Angelic Conflict because they have no Bible doctrine in their
souls to apply to their spiritual lives. 2 Tim. 3:5; 2 Tim. 3:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;holding to a form of godliness, although they have denied
its power; Avoid such men as these.&quot;  (2 Timothy 3:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;always learning and never able to come to the knowledge
of the truth.&quot;  (2 Timothy 3:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>These church programs can also take the believers out of
the local church and direct their focus on things “more important” than taking
in Bible doctrine from a trained pastor-teacher. 1 Tim. 6:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a
snare and many foolish and harmful desires which plunge men into ruin and
destruction.&quot;  (1 Timothy 6:9, NASB)</p>
