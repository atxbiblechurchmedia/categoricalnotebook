<h2><a name="_Maximum_Adversity,_Believer’s_2"></a>Maximum Adversity,
Believer’s Triumph – Part 4</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Tsadhe File - Divine Righteousness and Divine Good</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew letter Tsadhe represents a sickle or a reaping
hook. This pictures God’s judgment based on God’s righteousness. This is a
dissertation on divine righteousness and divine good.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:137, “Righteous” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>צדּיק</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(tsaddı̂yq) and means just, lawful,
righteous. This is only one characteristic of God's essence. The difference
between relative righteousness (-R) and God's perfect absolute righteousness
(+R) is illustrated by human good versus divine good. His +R and His perfect
absolute justice were satisfied at the Cross through the work of Christ and are
together called Holiness in Scripture.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Tsadhe. Righteous are You, O LORD, And upright are Your
judgments.&quot;  (Psalms 119:137, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Since they have been satisfied on the Cross, God's love
can be turned toward believers and not be not inconsistent with His perfect
righteousness and justice. “Upright are Your judgments” means God's justice is
perfectly fair. It was not unfair that he was on the death march. The testing
was good for him. It was good, so to speak, to bear the yoke in his youth. Rom.
8:28.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And we know that God causes all things to work together
for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His
purpose.&quot;  (Romans 8:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:138, “You have commanded” refers to
obedience to the person of Jesus Christ. “Your testimonies” refers to the Old
Testament Bible doctrine resulting in occupation with the person of Christ.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;You have commanded Your testimonies in righteousness And
exceeding faithfulness.&quot;  (Psalms 119:138, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“In righteousness” means God's holiness is absolute good
and therefore fair. “And exceeding faithfulness” refers to God's perfect
faithfulness in all of His Word and His promises. God doesn’t discipline us in
accordance with His Holiness. He administers divine discipline to His believers
from His love. He is our Father and we are His children. Discipline to meant to
correct those that He loves. Heb. 12:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;FOR THOSE WHOM THE LORD LOVES HE DISCIPLINES, AND HE
SCOURGES EVERY SON WHOM HE RECEIVES.&quot;&quot;  (Hebrews 12:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Faithfulness is God’s grace and God’s plan which are both
greater than our failures. God has never failed us. God has stated in writing
His faithfulness. This was what he thought when he got up and struggled through
each day of the death march.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:139, “My zeal has consumed me” refers a
word here for understanding doctrine and it giving you a burst of spiritual
adrenalin to meet the needs of the day which will be demanding. He understood
the essence of God. He understood the faithfulness of God. He understood the
absolute righteousness and fairness of God. Therefore, he had no mental
attitude sins. He did not feel sorry for himself.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;My zeal has consumed me, Because my adversaries have
forgotten Your words.&quot;  (Psalms 119:139, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Zeal” refers to his inner resources, extra spiritual
motivation to meet a very demanding day. This is in the area of psychosomatics.
We may be exhausted, tired, worn-out, shot, drained, and then Bible doctrine
hits the soul and you are revived.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In a pastor-teacher, there may be times when he has a
certain tiredness to communicate as he should. This situation evokes dependence
on the Lord because a pastor-teacher has no time to be sick. “Consumed” means
saturating someone to the point of making them move. Energy from a spiritual
source motivates him.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“My adversaries have forgotten Your words” means that on
this day of the march, the Babylonian soldiers were completely out of it
because they had debauched too much the night before. Whereas, he was strengthened
and ready to go. In contrast, the soldiers as the victors were dragging along.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:140, “Your word is very pure” refers to
Bible doctrine as being a purifier or a refiner of the soul.  Testing of the
Bible doctrine in your soul is much better for you than prosperity. That is why
the Bible doctrine in your edification complex of the soul is always being
tested so that you will grow spiritually. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Your word is very pure, Therefore Your servant loves
it.&quot;  (Psalms 119:140, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Growing spiritually means you are depending more on God’s
grace resources to solve life’s problems and situations. Prosperity cannot be
handled unless you are spiritually mature. Even then it can be dangerous. “Therefore
Your servant loves it” means he appreciated what testing did for his soul.
Prov. 8:17-19.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;I love those who love me; And those who diligently
seek me will find me. &quot;Riches and honor are with me, Enduring wealth and
righteousness. &quot;My fruit is better than gold, even pure gold, And my yield
better than choicest silver.&quot;  (Proverbs 8:17-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 8:17-19, “I” represents Bible doctrine or
divine wisdom. “I (divine wisdom) love those who love me (divine wisdom) and
those that seek me early (in youth) shall find me.” “Riches (material
prosperity) and honor (human fame) are with me, durable riches (glamourous
living) and righteousness (spiritual prosperity). If someone has a low human
IQ, they can learn Bible doctrine as well as anyone. The equipment is positive
volition on your part, the rest are the mechanics of grace.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 8:19, “My fruit (production) is better than
gold, even pure gold and my revenue (gain) than choice silver.” Look what a
trial did in the life of the man in Matthew 4:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But He answered and said, &quot;It is written, 'MAN SHALL
NOT LIVE ON BREAD ALONE, BUT ON EVERY WORD THAT PROCEEDS OUT OF THE MOUTH OF
GOD.'&quot;&quot;  (Matthew 4:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:141, “I am small and despised” means he was
young and hated, the object of contempt. “Yet I do not forget Your precepts”
means he did not forget the categorical Bible doctrine taught to him in the
right lobe of his soul, ready for application. Provided he had Bible doctrine
and was willing to apply it, the testing was of great benefit to him. Lam.
3:27.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I am small and despised, Yet I do not forget Your
precepts.&quot;  (Psalms 119:141, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;It is good for a man that he should bear The yoke in his
youth.&quot;  (Lamentations 3:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:142, “Your righteousness is an everlasting
righteousness” refers to the essence of God. God is always absolute good. When
God planned his life, He planned it in eternity past. “Your law is truth” means
he had an absolute anchor.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Your righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, And
Your law is truth.&quot;  (Psalms 119:142, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:143, “Trouble and anguish have come upon
me” means they have grabbed him. This is a very severe trial and really rough.
Trouble has embraced him and encircled him. “Yet Your commandments are my
delight” means he still had a passion for Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Trouble and anguish have come upon me, Yet Your
commandments are my delight.&quot;  (Psalms 119:143, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:144, “Your testimonies are righteous
forever” refers to the immutability of God. “Give me understanding that I may
live” means cause me to understand doctrine and I will be refreshed.” Look at
the impact one stabilized believer can have. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Your testimonies are righteous forever; Give me
understanding that I may live.&quot;  (Psalms 119:144, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Qoph File – Problems With the Subconscious </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew letter Qoph represents the back of the head or
the subconscious. The subconscious can give you problems such as a guilt
complex, an inferiority complex, a superiority complex and fears.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:145, “I cried with all my heart” means he
was in a truly helpless and hopeless situation. He was struggling to stay in
fellowship and even tempted to commit suicide. In the right lobe of his soul in
the frame of reference and memory center he not only recalled the horrors of
the march, but Bible doctrine as well. In his conscience and spiritual norms
and standards, depression was knocking for an entrance. There was pressure to
reject divine norms and standards and succumb to the pressure. He was
considering human viewpoint thinking.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Qoph. I cried with all my heart; answer me, O LORD! I
will observe Your statutes.&quot;  (Psalms 119:145, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Answer me, O Lord!” means he sensed that he was
slipping. “I will observe Your statutes” refers to Bible doctrine presented
categorically. Nebuchadnezzar had a tremendous appreciation for Jeremiah.
Jeremiah was seated and watched the chain gang go by, the flower of the youth
of Israel. As they went by, he spoke to them in Lamentations. Based on some of
the things that were said from the examination of the Hebrew, this was as close
as he came to cracking up. In Lamentations 3:21, “I have hope” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>יחל</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(yâchal) and is used of the spiritual
frame of reference under extreme pressure.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;This I recall to my mind, Therefore I have hope.&quot; 
(Lamentations 3:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Lamentations 3:22-23, “The Lord’s lovingkindnesses
indeed never cease” means His grace, His provision never ceases. They are new
every morning. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The LORD'S lovingkindnesses indeed never cease, For His
compassions never fail. They are new every morning; Great is Your
faithfulness.&quot;  (Lamentations 3:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Lamentations 3:24-25, “my portion” is the grace
apparatus for perception. I trust in Him in the midst of pressure. The Bible
doctrine in the soul carried him through it. This is Jeremiah’s prophecy of the
rise of a renewed nation. The message was there to sustain.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;The LORD is my portion,&quot; says my soul,
&quot;Therefore I have hope in Him.&quot; The LORD is good to those who wait
for Him, To the person who seeks Him.&quot;  (Lamentations 3:24-25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:146, “I cried to You” means the 19th day
was very crucial. He was struggling to keep his sanity. Nightmares came from
his subconscious and he would wake up in horror. You will need less sleep as
the subconscious empties. Four hours of sound sleep is worth eight hours of
restless sleep.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I cried to You; save me And I shall keep Your
testimonies.&quot;  (Psalms 119:146, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Save me” is the hiphil imperative of <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>ישׁע</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(yâsha‛) and means cause me to be
delivered and the cry was coming from his subconscious. “Your testimonies”
refers to Bible doctrine pertaining to the person and work of Jesus Christ -
Levitical offerings, the tabernacle, the priesthood, the holy days. This is
occupation with Christ under the most difficult of situations.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:147, “I rise before dawn” is the piel
intensive of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>קדם</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(qâdam) and means to
anticipate or go up early. “And cry for help” was his intense prayer for God's
deliverance from the horrors around him. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I rise before dawn and cry for help; I wait for Your
words.&quot;  (Psalms 119:147, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“I wait for Your words” means to have faith under maximum
pressure. Faith is a system of perception and a system of perception involves
thinking. Thinking involves vocabulary and that vocabulary must involve divine
viewpoint vocabulary which can be used.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Experiences that have been particularly extreme will
occasionally come back to people to bother them, for example, a woman who has
been raped. The sexual abuse problem could have haunted him the rest of his
life, but Bible doctrine in his soul and divine viewpoint thinking took care of
it. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:148, “My eyes anticipate the night watches”
means he was anticipating a good night’s sleep. The night before had exhausted
him and he was shot. “That I may meditate on Your word” says he was looking
forward to thinking about Bible doctrine. Not only did he anticipate sleep, but
thinking about Bible doctrine and about the Lord</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;My eyes anticipate the night watches, That I may meditate
on Your word.&quot;  (Psalms 119:148, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Psalms 119:149 involves him having a terrible experience.
“Hear my voice according to Your lovingkindness” is intense prayer for his
extreme situation and abuse. Billions of years ago, God knew that he would face
these abuses. Therefore, the Lord made provision for that extreme adversity.
But to meet that adversity, this young man needed to utilize Bible doctrine and
by doing so stay in fellowship, otherwise his life would be filled with
distortions and other problems. “Revive me” means to refresh based on the
divine wisdom in his soul.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Hear my voice according to Your lovingkindness; Revive
me, O LORD, according to Your ordinances.&quot;  (Psalms 119:149, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:150, “wickedness” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>זמּה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(zimmâh) and means wicked schemes, lewd acts and refers
to all of the rape, torture and sexual abuse that this young man had going on
all around him. The soldiers are advancing to attack the children and the other
prisoners on the death march.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Those who follow after wickedness draw near; They are far
from Your law.&quot;  (Psalms 119:150, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Leviticus 18:17, “lewdness” is also <i>zimmâh</i>.
When the Bible speaks about a subject, it ought to be translated and taught
accurately. We know from this verse that <i>zimmâh</i> is related to abnormal
and perverted sexual activity. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;'You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and of
her daughter, nor shall you take her son's daughter or her daughter's daughter,
to uncover her nakedness; they are blood relatives. It is lewdness.&quot; 
(Leviticus 18:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 10:23, “wickedness” is also <i>zimmâh</i>
and is a sport to a degenerate fool. These are abnormal and perverted
activities. “And so is wisdom to a man of understanding” means a man of
understanding is one with Bible doctrine in his soul and has wisdom regarding
sexual abuse matters.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Doing wickedness is like sport to a fool, And so is
wisdom to a man of understanding.&quot;  (Proverbs 10:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This boy had a sexual catastrophe. He was attacked by
males. Without his consent he was sexually abused that night. This could have
scarred him for life, destroyed him, ruined him, but it didn’t. You do not have
to be ruined by these things. The Bible doctrine in your soul and God’s grace
resources will enable you to continue and handle the situation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ezekiel 22:9-11, “they have committed acts of
lewdness” is again <i>zimmâh</i> and means lewdness with evil intent,
homosexual activities, sexual abuse, and perversion. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Slanderous men have been in you for the purpose of
shedding blood, and in you they have eaten at the mountain shrines. In your
midst they have committed acts of lewdness. &quot;In you they have uncovered
their fathers' nakedness; in you they have humbled her who was unclean in her
menstrual impurity. &quot;One has committed abomination with his neighbor's
wife and another has lewdly defiled his daughter-in-law. And another in you has
humbled his sister, his father's daughter.&quot;  (Ezekiel 22:9-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Jeremiah 11:15, “she has done many vile deeds” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL>מזמּה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>(mezimmâh) and refers to homosexuals worshiping in the house of the
Lord.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;What right has My beloved in My house When she has
done many vile deeds? Can the sacrificial flesh take away from you your
disaster, So that you can rejoice?&quot;&quot;  (Jeremiah 11:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:151, “You are near, O Lord” is what he was
thinking when he was being abused. “Your commandments are truth” means that
divine viewpoint thinking kept him sane. His body was abused, but his soul was
kept intact. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;You are near, O LORD, And all Your commandments are
truth.&quot;  (Psalms 119:151, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:152, “Of old I have known from Your
testimonies” means he understood the doctrine of divine decrees and he was
occupied with Jesus Christ. Bible doctrine is greater than any disaster in
life. Bible doctrine handles the problems of the subconscious just as it
handles the problems of consciousness. If you are alive when the smoke clears,
you will have an unbelievable spiritual life and ministry.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Of old I have known from Your testimonies That You have
founded them forever.&quot;  (Psalms 119:152, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is a unique file and an honest file. When you face
your crisis, your <i>zimmâh</i> pressure, you too can always be assured that
doctrine can take care of every pressure.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Resh File – Thinking with Divine Viewpoint </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew letter Resh represents the head and refers to
what you think, the mentality. This time, the emphasis is on the right lobe of
the soul where Bible doctrine resides and results in divine viewpoint thinking.
The Word of God reveals for our total understanding why God destroys a nation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:153, “Look upon my affliction” means to
observe what is going on. He was still applying the doctrine of God’s plan.
“Affliction” is <i>zimmâh</i> type abuse. “And rescue me” is the piel
imperative of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>חָלַץ</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(chalats) and means
to rescue, to remove the situation, to equalize, to neutralize this terrible
situation. He prays intensively on the basis of the Word of God and the
character of God.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Resh. Look upon my affliction and rescue me, For I do not
forget Your law.&quot;  (Psalms 119:153, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:154, “Plead my cause and redeem me” means
to defend my cause and deliver me from the situation. He wished to be able to
move, to teach Bible doctrine even though each night was a nightmare.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Plead my cause and redeem me; Revive me according to Your
word.&quot;  (Psalms 119:154, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Revive me” is the piel imperative of <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>חָיָה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> (chayah) and means to revive, to refresh. This is a grace given
refreshment in the midst of intense pressure. This is not the refreshment of
taking a hot bath or shower. This is not the refreshment of sitting back on a
recliner and sipping your favorite beverage. This is not the refreshment of relaxing
during some leisure time activity. Bible doctrine is the basis of the
refreshment.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:155, “Salvation is far from the wicked”
means they are negative to Bible doctrine and they are negative to freedom.
These soldiers are in soul slavery. He watched these animals at work. The
slaves got stronger and the Chaldeans got weaker. The Chaldeans could not stand
power. They had too much power. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Salvation is far from the wicked, For they do not seek
Your statutes.&quot;  (Psalms 119:155, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>From divine viewpoint, one nation is going down and one
nation is going up. “For they do not seek Your statutes” is the qal perfect of <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>דּרשׁ</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(dârash) which is a completed action. A
nation cannot endure without Bible doctrine. Hosea 4:5 says that when a nation
rejects Bible doctrine, it destroys itself. When he woke up in the morning he
knew these people were on the way out as a nation.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So you will stumble by day, And the prophet also will
stumble with you by night; And I will destroy your mother.&quot;  (Hosea 4:5,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:156, “Great are Your mercies” refers to
God's acts of grace. They were in slavery, but they had survived. They were
still alive on the 20th day. The bodies had been abused, but the souls were
intact. John 8:32.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Great are Your mercies, O LORD; Revive me according to
Your ordinances.&quot;  (Psalms 119:156, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you
free.&quot;&quot;  (John 8:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This young man understood why Israel was wiped out under
the fifth cycle of discipline. Where had he learn that? From Jeremiah. When a
nation with light becomes depraved, it is conquered by a more depraved nation.
God makes a depraved nation eat their depravity. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The loose women get raped. The slack husbands who beat
their wives when they are drunk are beaten by drunks who are their conquerors,
etc. However, one day this young man will walk back over the graves of the
Chaldeans. Where are the Chaldeans today? They have been gone for 2,500 years.
Where are the Jews today? They are still around because that young man became
the teacher of young men who were positive to Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Resh file is a total understanding of why God
destroys a nation. Every nation in history that was destroyed, destroyed itself
first. Teenagers who get Bible doctrine are the hope of our nation. “Revive me
according to Your ordinances” refers to the principle of propitiation. He was
appealing to the essence of God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:157, “Many are my persecutors and my
adversaries” means he hads a lot of people against him, yet he was still
occupied with Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Many are my persecutors and my adversaries, Yet I do not
turn aside from Your testimonies.&quot;  (Psalms 119:157, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:158, “I behold the treacherous” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>בּגד</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(bâgad) and refers to a person guilty of
rape and violence. Lots of things can make you sick. Bible doctrine helps you
pick up and move on. “And loathe them” means he was so sick he had to vomit.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I behold the treacherous and loathe them, Because they do
not keep Your word.&quot;  (Psalms 119:158, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:159, “Consider how love Your precepts”
means he loved Bible doctrine, the Word of God. “Revive me, O LORD, according
to Your lovingkindness” means refresh me Lord according to your living grace in
action.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Consider how I love Your precepts; Revive me, O LORD,
according to Your lovingkindness.&quot;  (Psalms 119:159, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:160, “The sum of your word is truth” says
that the essence of God's Word is Bible doctrine. He was hooked into the
eternal loving God.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The sum of Your word is truth, And every one of Your
righteous ordinances is everlasting.&quot;  (Psalms 119:160, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Shin File – Daily learning the Word of God</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew letter Shin represents a tooth and is
pronounced “seen or sheen.” This introduces the principle of learning the Word
of God every day. This file will emphasize constant intake of Bible doctrine.
Matt. 4:4. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But He answered and said, &quot;It is written, 'MAN SHALL
NOT LIVE ON BREAD ALONE, BUT ON EVERY WORD THAT PROCEEDS OUT OF THE MOUTH OF
GOD.'&quot;&quot;  (Matthew 4:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The death march was about over. Those who had survived
had done so because of God's grace provision and the Bible doctrine in their
souls.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:161, “Princes” are the Babylonian nobility.
Apparently, there were more than soldiers on this death march. When the
nobility of a land become decadent, it is indicative that most the people of
the land are also decadent. The exception is always a faithful remnant of
positive believers. Such decadent nations will go out under the fifth cycle of
discipline if the decadence continues. Zech. 1:15. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Shin. Princes persecute me without cause, But my heart
stands in awe of Your words.&quot;  (Psalms 119:161, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;But I am very angry with the nations who are at
ease; for while I was only a little angry, they furthered the
disaster.&quot;&quot;  (Zechariah 1:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Persecute me without cause” means there is never an
excuse for abuse of power. “But my heart stands in awe” is <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>פּחד</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(pâchad) and refers to the dominant soul
of this young person and that he was satisfied and occupied with the Word of
God. He was absolutely fascinated with the ability of God’s Word to carry him
through the most awful difficulties. His soul stayed intact. He made decisions
all along the way to stick with the Word. What does Bible doctrine mean to you?</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:162, his testimony continues on what the
Word meant to him over the past three weeks. “I rejoice at Your Word” refers to
his inner happiness from the Bible doctrine in his soul and God's grace
provision. “As one who finds great spoil” refers to great profit, great gain,
and connotes a gift. Bible doctrine gives you a real zest for living.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I rejoice at Your word, As one who finds great
spoil.&quot;  (Psalms 119:162, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This young man was blessed by keeping his divine
viewpoint thinking under the most extreme circumstances. Get Bible doctrine in
the right lobe of your soul. In Proverbs 8:32-33, “Heed instruction and be
wise, And do not neglect it.” Don’t go negative.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Now therefore, O sons, listen to me, For blessed
are they who keep my ways. &quot;Heed instruction and be wise, And do not
neglect it.&quot;  (Proverbs 8:32-33, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 8:34, “Watching daily at my gates, Waiting at
my doorposts” means to go where Bible doctrine is taught daily.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Blessed is the man who listens to me, Watching
daily at my gates, Waiting at my doorposts.&quot;  (Proverbs 8:34, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:163, “I hate and despise falsehood” is
referring to false doctrine. “But I love Your law” is the qal perfect and means
to keep on loving Bible doctrine. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I hate and despise falsehood, But I love Your law.&quot; 
(Psalms 119:163, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:164, “Seven time a day I praise You” is in
the past tense. He did this before the fall of Jerusalem. You can’t go to Bible
class too much.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Seven times a day I praise You, Because of Your righteous
ordinances.&quot;  (Psalms 119:164, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>People may say that the pastor puts too much emphasis on
the military. They may say that he makes people dependent upon him. There are
always other things that must be done that are given a higher priority than
going to Bible class and learning the Word of God and what God has planned for
your life.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is what many had done while living in Jerusalem.
Bible doctrine was not very important to them. When they needed spiritual
strength, they had nothing. These people died on the death march. The positive
believers who ignored the mockery from others negative to Bible doctrine lived
through the death march. Live up to the light you have. You cannot get too much
Bible doctrine into your soul. You can never gain too much divine wisdom. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:165, “great peace” is inner happiness plus
doctrine resulting in a relaxed mental attitude. This is inner soul stability.
“Nothing causes them to stumble” in the Hebrew says, “There is not a stumbling
block to them.” That is, to those who have great peace.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Those who love Your law have great peace, And nothing
causes them to stumble.&quot;  (Psalms 119:165, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A stumbling block is a person who is obnoxious to you.
Also, your own carnal action can make you a stumbling block to others. When you
have “great peace” people don’t get you down. You take doctrine inside so that
no person can get you down.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:166, “I hope for Your salvation, O Lord” is
the piel perfect and is saying that he knew when this thing started that he
would be delivered. Why? Bible doctrine in his soul. Isaiah 54:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I hope for Your salvation, O LORD, And do Your
commandments.&quot;  (Psalms 119:166, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;No weapon that is formed against you will prosper;
And every tongue that accuses you in judgment you will condemn. This is the
heritage of the servants of the LORD, And their vindication is from Me,&quot;
declares the LORD.&quot;  (Isaiah 54:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Salvation” is physical deliverance. “I do Your
commandments” is the perfect tense of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>עָשָׂה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>(asah) and means to make something out of something. This means to make
a relaxed mental attitude out of Bible doctrine. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:167, “My soul keeps Your testimonies” means
his soul is on guard for Bible doctrine. He had a healthy soul. “And I love
them exceedingly” refers to his rapport love with the Word. This unpleasant
experience hadn’t made him go negative. He was saying he loved the Word of God
to the maximum, to the utmost limit of his capacity.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;My soul keeps Your testimonies, And I love them
exceedingly.&quot;  (Psalms 119:167, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:168, “I keep Your precepts and Your
testimonies” means he had stayed in fellowship. “For all my ways are before You”
says that he was a young man and still had his life before him. He knew he was
going to survive and continue to grow to spiritual maturity. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I keep Your precepts and Your testimonies, For all my
ways are before You.&quot;  (Psalms 119:168, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Tav File - The Faithfulness of God</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew letter Tav represents a signature. Instead of
saying “Make your mark,” they would say “Make your tav” if he couldn’t write.
The significance is that this will close out the death march and he was still
around to sign his name all from the faithfulness of God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:169, “Let my cry come before You, O Lord”
means to let my cry (under pressure) come near before you. He was saying to let
his call come before the throne of grace. He was going to pray.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Tav. Let my cry come before You, O LORD; Give me
understanding according to Your word.&quot;  (Psalms 119:169, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Give me understanding according to your Word” is the
hiphil stem (perfect) of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>בּין</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(bı̂yn). He was
saying, “Cause me to evaluate my experience biblically. I know I can. I will be
able to.” No past disaster could hold him down or give him a guilt complex, it
could only work together for good.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is no difficulty, heartache or frustration or
catastrophe in your life that should ever make you bitter or that should upset
you in the future. This was a relaxed, wonderful person emerging from the pit
of pressure and disaster.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:170, “Let my supplication come before You”
is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>תּחנּה</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(techinnâh) and is
not the ordinary word for prayer which is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>קָנָה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(qânâh).  This means to use prayer as an
expression of grace or orientation to grace. This is not begging. This is
letting your prayer, oriented to grace, come before God the Father.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Let my supplication come before You; Deliver me according
to Your word.&quot;  (Psalms 119:170, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Deliver me according to Your word” is the hiphil and
means to cause me to be physically delivered. He wants to be rescued, not
because he was anything, but because God’s Word is true. The battle was the
Lord’s, not his. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:171, “Let my lips utter praise” means to be
caused to utter or gush out praise. He anticipated a long life after
deliverance from slavery. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Let my lips utter praise, For You teach me Your
statutes.&quot;  (Psalms 119:171, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“For You teach me Your statutes” refers to categories of
Bible doctrine. In other words, there were some things he had yet to learn and
after he had learned them, he was going to live a normal, wonderful,
God-oriented life.  He was not going to go through life carrying the scars of
this disaster. There is too much emphasis today on bad background or bad
experiences. They forget Romans 8:28. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And we know that God causes all things to work together
for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His
purpose.&quot;  (Romans 8:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:172, “Let my tongue sing of Your word”
means that as long as he lived, he would teach Bible doctrine. He was really
grace oriented. His tongue was dedicated to the communication of the Word of
God.  In the New Testament Greek, three words carry similar meaning. Some of it
will be λαλέω (laleō) which means to speak, to talk, some will be παρακαλέω
(parakaleō) which means to exhort, to comfort, to encourage, to instruct, and
some will be διδάσκω (didaskō) which means to teach.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Let my tongue sing of Your word, For all Your
commandments are righteousness.&quot;  (Psalms 119:172, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“For all Your commandments are righteousness” means all
your commandments are perfection, the plan of God is perfect and must be
communicated to believers. There is nothing wrong with the plan of God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:173, “Let Your hand be ready to help me”
mean he was talking about teaching the Word of God. He needed the facility of
communication. “For I have chosen Your precepts” means he had chosen for his
lifetime to teach Bible doctrine categorically. He wanted to make Bible
doctrine and grace clear to others who would listen. Isaiah 28:10; Isaiah
28:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Let Your hand be ready to help me, For I have chosen Your
precepts.&quot;  (Psalms 119:173, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;For He says, 'Order on order, order on order, Line
on line, line on line, A little here, a little there.'&quot;&quot;  (Isaiah
28:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So the word of the LORD to them will be, &quot;Order on
order, order on order, Line on line, line on line, A little here, a little
there,&quot; That they may go and stumble backward, be broken, snared and taken
captive.&quot;  (Isaiah 28:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:174, “I long for Your salvation” shows that
he was human like anyone else. This was the human side now. He was normal. He
didn’t need tranquilizers, drugs, or alcohol. What made the difference was the
utilization of Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I long for Your salvation, O LORD, And Your law is my
delight.&quot;  (Psalms 119:174, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Your law is my delight” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שׁעשׁע</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(sha‛shûa‛) and means delight, pleasure.
When this word is used, it means Bible doctrine was his life and everything
else was incidental. This was his attitude toward preparation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:175 are the results of “delight.” The
results are to “let my soul live” and means to let his soul be refreshed. “That
it may praise You, And let Your ordinances help me” means that God’s spiritual
freedom enables the believer to grow spiritually from God's grace resources
gained from Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the soul.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Let my soul live that it may praise You, And let Your
ordinances help me.&quot;  (Psalms 119:175, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:176,  “I have gone astray like a lost
sheep” means he was normal and had failed at times, but he had no illusions
about himself and he knew he was far from perfect. Through it all, the Lord had
brought back the sheep. They survived. Bible doctrine always brings you back to
the grace and plan of God.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek Your servant,
For I do not forget Your commandments.&quot;  (Psalms 119:176, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Seek Your servant” is an imperative, a command. He was
praying that God would look after him and when he failed, bring him back into
line no matter what it took.  He was asking for grace for the rest of his life.
He was saying to God that if He looked after him, that he would never forget
Bible doctrine. Keep me in line and I’ll keep cranking out the Word.</p>
