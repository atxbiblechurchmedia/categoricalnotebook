<h2>Angelic Conflict, Testing of Mankind’s Volition</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The volition in mankind is tested under two different
types of circumstances. At the beginning of man’s time on the earth, Adam and
Eve were tested in the Garden under innocence and in perfect environment. He
was the First Adam. They expressed negative volition by partaking of the
forbidden tree. At the end of man’s time on earth, mankind will be tested in
the Millennium also in perfect environment. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Under both sets of circumstances you have perfect
environment. Negative volition is expressed by unbelievers who reject even the
very clearest presentation of the Gospel. When Satan is loosed at the end of
the Millennium, unbelievers will revolt with Satan against Jesus Christ. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>So perfect environment was the first test of man and you
have the First Adam failing the test through negative volition. But the Last
Adam, Jesus Christ, was tested by the tree also, the Cross, and He passed with
positive volition. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The test of mankind’s positive volition toward God is also
two-fold. The first test is the unbeliever’s response to the work of Jesus
Christ on the Cross – it can only be rejection or acceptance. Grace is offered.
Positive volition expresses itself by faith in Jesus Christ. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If only one person in all human history expressed
positive faith belief in the substitutionary spiritual death of Jesus Christ on
the Cross for their sins, then the God's sentence pronounced on Satan and
fallen angels is justified and will be executed. In every generation of human
history, many have personally believed in Jesus Christ as their Savior.
Therefore, God's sentence pronounced on Satan and fallen angels is fair,
justified and will be executed.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The second test of positive volition is whether the
believer will grow spiritually by availing themselves of the teaching of Bible
doctrine provided and whether they will use the grace resources provided by God
to carry out what God intended for their lives on earth. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual maturity has great impact in the Angelic
Conflict. If even one believer reaches spiritual maturity, they demonstrate
that God's perfect fairness and grace provision is sufficient even in the
sinful imperfect environment found on earth. This glorifies God to the maximum.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Man’s faith in Jesus Christ (positive volition) resolves
the Angelic Conflict. The great issue of the Angelic Conflict is will man, an
inferior creature to angels and equipped with the identical free will, choose
for or against the plan of God? One unbeliever accepting Jesus Christ as Savior
proves to Satan the folly of his objection. If an inferior creation responds to
Jesus Christ, a superior creation is certainly under indictment and judgment.
Hebrews 1 and 2.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Good angels in heaven rejoice over one sinner that
repents. Why? Every time someone accepts Jesus Christ, it resolves the Angelic
Conflict.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When the Body of Christ (the Church) reaches the number
of believers that fulfills God's perfect plan, this will trigger the Rapture of
the Church. When the Church comes back with Jesus Christ, He will establish His
Millennial Kingdom on earth for 1,000 years. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Prior to the start of the Millennium, Satan and all
fallen angels will be bound in the bottomless pit. The presence of Jesus Christ
on earth, the removal of all Church Age and Tribulational unbelievers, and the
removal of Satan and all fallen angels will result in the perfect environment
of the Millennium. </p>
