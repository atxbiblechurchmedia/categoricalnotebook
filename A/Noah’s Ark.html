<h2><a name="_Noah’s_Ark"></a>Noah’s Ark</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Noah’s Ark was made of one material, gopher wood, which represented
the humanity of Christ. The growing tree refers to the life of Christ. Cutting
the tree is a picture of the Cross. Whoever provides salvation must die twice -
spiritually and physically. Gen. 6:14-16; Phil. 2:5-8; Heb. 2:17. </p>

<p class=Verses>““Make for yourself an ark of gopher wood; you shall make the
ark with rooms, and shall cover it inside and out with pitch. “This is how you
shall make it: the length of the ark three hundred cubits, its breadth fifty
cubits, and its height thirty cubits. “You shall make a window for the ark, and
finish it to a cubit from the top; and set the door of the ark in the side of
it; you shall make it with lower, second, and third decks.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis
6:14-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, He had to be made like His brethren in all things,
so that He might become a merciful and faithful high priest in things
pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews
2:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The ark represented Jesus Christ as the Messiah and contained
eight believers in Positional Truth. No judgment would come to them because
they were in Christ Jesus. The world outside was destroyed. Those inside remained
safe. Rom. 8:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in
Christ Jesus.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 8:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The ark was covered with pitch as waterproofing. This is
a picture of unlimited atonement where the work of Christ on the Cross paid for
the sins of all mankind, not just those who choose to become believers. Rom. 5:11;
Heb. 9:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And not only this, but we also exult in God through our Lord
Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
5:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason He is the mediator of a new covenant, so that,
since a death has taken place for the redemption of the transgressions that
were committed under the first covenant, those who have been called may receive
the promise of the eternal inheritance.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 9:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The ark was built from a single set of plans with specific
dimensions that made the ark an inherently stable vessel. This is a picture of God’s
plan. God’s plan begins at salvation for the believer. Acts 16:31.</p>

<p class=Verses>“They said, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved,
you and your household.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 16:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s plan mandates that we stay in fellowship in the
spiritual life by repeated use of 1 John 1:9. Eph. 5:18. </p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
John 1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but
be filled with the Spirit,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In so doing, we grow spiritually and are to witness to
the unbeliever using pertinent doctrine in our soul. John 3:36; Acts 1:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>““He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who does
not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(John
3:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon
you; and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and
Samaria, and even to the remotest part of the earth.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 1:8,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our eternal future with Jesus Christ is mentioned in John
14:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>““If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and
receive you to Myself, that where I am, there you may be also.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John
14:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The ark had only one door and is a picture of the single
path to salvation through Jesus Christ. John 14:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life;
no one comes to the Father but through Me.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 14:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The ark had only one window and represents God the Holy
Spirit. There is only one way to have fellow­ship with God and that is confession
of known sins to God the Father using 1 John 1:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
John 1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The ark had three floors that represented the death, burial,
and resurrection of Jesus Christ. There are three areas of positional truth - Retroactive
Positional Truth based on the Cross, Current Positional Truth based on our
permanent union with Jesus Christ, and Experiential Positional Truth based on
whether our sin nature controls our soul (carnality) or the Holy Spirit
controls our soul (spirituality). See the category on <a href="#_Sanctification">Sanctification</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The storm came from below and above. It rained 40 days
and nights. Up to this time, the earth was watered by mist from the earth below.
Noah believed God. It did rain, even though it hadn’t ever rained prior to that
time. Gen. 2:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But a mist used to rise from the earth and water the whole
surface of the ground.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis 2:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God kept the air inside the ark clean and breathable and
miraculously removed waste products. The storm fell on the ark, but not on the
inside. This represents the safety of believers in union with Christ as
protection from any judgment. Judgment fell on Christ for all of us as He hung
on the Cross. Rom. 8:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in
Christ Jesus.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 8:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There was only one category of survivors – believers.
Twice in human history, all unbelievers are removed from the earth leaving only
believers on the earth. These were the Great Flood and the Baptism of Fire at
the Second Advent of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
