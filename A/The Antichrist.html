<h2><a name="_The_Antichrist"></a>The Antichrist</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An antichrist is someone who opposes or is against the
Lord. In the Greek, <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>ντι</span>́ (anti) can
be translated two ways: “instead of” and “against.” “Instead of “ refers to
someone trying to pass himself off as the real Messiah or Jesus Christ.
“Against” refers to those against Christ or who oppose Jesus Christ. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 John 2:18, “antichrist” refers to the Dictator of
Palestine in the Tribulation who will deceive many by trying to pass himself
off as the Messiah. “Many antichrists” refers to those who oppose Jesus
Christ.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Children, it is the last hour; and just as you heard that
antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have appeared; from this we
know that it is the last hour.&quot;  (1 John 2:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'><b>Antichrists in the Church Age </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Today, the term “antichrist” refers to any believer who
is out of fellowship especially those who remain in the state of carnality for
a long time called reversionism. 1 John 2:22; 1 John 4:3; 2 John 1:7; 1 John
2:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Who is the liar but the one who denies that Jesus is the
Christ? This is the antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the
Son.&quot;  (1 John 2:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from
God; this is the spirit of the antichrist, of which you have heard that it is
coming, and now it is already in the world.&quot;  (1 John 4:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those
who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. This is the
deceiver and the antichrist.&quot;  (2 John 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Children, it is the last hour; and just as you heard that
antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have appeared; from this we
know that it is the last hour.&quot;  (1 John 2:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Reversionistic believers become the “enemy of God” in
James 4:4, the “hater of God” in John 15:23, and “enemies of the cross” in
Philippians 3:18. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;You adulteresses, do you not know that friendship with
the world is hostility toward God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of
the world makes himself an enemy of God.&quot;  (James 4:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;He who hates Me hates My Father also.&quot;  (John
15:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For many walk, of whom I often told you, and now tell you
even weeping, that they are enemies of the cross of Christ,&quot;  (Philippians
3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Antichrist in the Tribulation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Antichrist in the Tribulation is an unbeliever whose
soul will be controlled by Satan himself. He has many titles in the Bible. He
is one of two great dictators in the Tribulation. He is the Beast out of the
sea (the sea of nations), the Gentile ruler of the Revived Roman Empire. He is
also called the king of the West in the Armageddon Campaign. He is the leader
of religion in the Tribulation. The numerous titles for the Antichrist are
listed below.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“A beast coming up out of the sea” in Revelation 13:1-10
and “a beast” in Revelation 17:7-13. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And the dragon stood on the sand of the seashore. Then I
saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and on
his horns were ten diadems, and on his heads were blasphemous names.&quot; 
(Revelation 13:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And the angel said to me, &quot;Why do you wonder? I will
tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries her, which has
the seven heads and the ten horns.&quot;  (Revelation 17:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;These have one purpose, and they give their power
and authority to the beast.&quot;  (Revelation 17:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&quot;The man of lawlessness” and “the son of
destruction” in 2 Thessalonians 2:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Let no one in any way deceive you, for it will not come
unless the apostasy comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the
son of destruction,&quot;  (2 Thessalonians 2:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&quot;The little horn” in Daniel 7:8 and Daniel 19
through Daniel 26.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;While I was contemplating the horns, behold,
another horn, a little one, came up among them, and three of the first horns
were pulled out by the roots before it; and behold, this horn possessed eyes
like the eyes of a man and a mouth uttering great boasts.&quot;  (Daniel 7:8,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&quot;The abomination of desolation” in Matthew 24:15. A
statue of him will be put up in the temple at Jerusalem, a sign for all
believers to flee immediately to the mountains. See category on <a
href="#_D-The_Abomination_of">The Abomination of Desolation</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Therefore when you see the ABOMINATION OF
DESOLATION which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy
place (let the reader understand),&quot;  (Matthew 24:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“The prince who is to come” in Daniel 9:26-27.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Then after the sixty-two weeks the Messiah will be
cut off and have nothing, and the people of the prince who is to come will
destroy the city and the sanctuary. And its end will come with a flood; even to
the end there will be war; desolations are determined. &quot;And he will make a
firm covenant with the many for one week, but in the middle of the week he will
put a stop to sacrifice and grain offering; and on the wing of abominations
will come one who makes desolate, even until a complete destruction, one that
is decreed, is poured out on the one who makes desolate.&quot;&quot;  (Daniel
9:26-27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“The leader of Tyre” in Ezekiel 28:1-10. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Son of man, say to the leader of Tyre, 'Thus says
the Lord GOD, &quot;Because your heart is lifted up And you have said, 'I am a
god, I sit in the seat of gods In the heart of the seas'; Yet you are a man and
not God, Although you make your heart like the heart of God—&quot;  (Ezekiel
28:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“The feet of the image” in Nebuchadnezzar's dream that
Daniel interpreted in Daniel 2:31-45.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of
clay.&quot;  (Daniel 2:33, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;In that you saw the feet and toes, partly of
potter's clay and partly of iron, it will be a divided kingdom; but it will
have in it the toughness of iron, inasmuch as you saw the iron mixed with
common clay.&quot;  (Daniel 2:41, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Dictator of Palestine</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Jewish Dictator of Palestine in the Tribulation may
also be called an antichrist because he will trys to pass himself off as Jesus
Christ. He too will be controlled by Satan. He will come to the Jews and will
deceive them into thinking he is the Messiah. He will counterfeit the Lord
Jesus Christ “like a lamb” in Revelation 13:11 and Daniel 11:37.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;He will show no regard for the gods of his fathers
or for the desire of women, nor will he show regard for any other god; for he
will magnify himself above them all.&quot;  (Daniel 11:37, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth; and
he had two horns like a lamb and he spoke as a dragon.&quot;  (Revelation
13:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Jewish Dictator of Palestine is going to rule his
people in the Tribulation. Gen. 49:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Dan shall judge his people, As one of the tribes of
Israel.&quot;  (Genesis 49:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As an antichrist, he will come from the Tribe of Dan. Dan
is one of the worst of all the Jewish tribes. It was the first tribe to go into
idolatry. Judges 18:30. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The sons of Dan set up for themselves the graven image;
and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were
priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the
land.&quot;  (Judges 18:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Dan was the last tribe to receive an inheritance in the
land. Joshua 19:47-49. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The territory of the sons of Dan proceeded beyond them;
for the sons of Dan went up and fought with Leshem and captured it. Then they
struck it with the edge of the sword and possessed it and settled in it; and
they called Leshem Dan after the name of Dan their father. This was the
inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Dan according to their families, these
cities with their villages. When they finished apportioning the land for
inheritance by its borders, the sons of Israel gave an inheritance in their midst
to Joshua the son of Nun.&quot;  (Joshua 19:47-49, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The tribe of Dan is mentioned last on every list that
involves merit. 1 Chron. 27:21-22.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;for the half-tribe of Manasseh in Gilead, Iddo the son of
Zechariah; for Benjamin, Jaasiel the son of Abner; for Dan, Azarel the son of
Jeroham. These were the princes of the tribes of Israel.&quot;  (1 Chronicles
27:21-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>No evangelists (144,000) come from the tribe of Dan in
the Tribulation. Rev. 7. The Tribe of Dan is omitted from the genealogies of 1
Chronicles 2-10. The Dictator of Palestine divides the land for gain,
counterfeiting the Abrahamic Covenant. Dan. 11:39.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;He will take action against the strongest of
fortresses with the help of a foreign god; he will give great honor to those
who acknowledge him and will cause them to rule over the many, and will parcel
out land for a price.&quot;  (Daniel 11:39, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 49:17, the “horse” refers to Israel in the
Tribulation. The Jewish Dictator of Palestine (Dan) will seek to destroy the
believing remnant in the Tribulation. The “rider” is the Jewish remnant of
believers in the Tribulation. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Dan shall be a serpent in the way, A horned snake
in the path, That bites the horse's heels, So that his rider falls
backward.&quot;  (Genesis 49:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The remnant of Israel offer this cry when the Jewish Dictator
of Palestine starts to oppress them in the Tribulation. Dan depicts apostate
Israel under the Jewish Dictator of Palestine in the Tribulation. Gen.
49:16-17.</p>

<p class=Verses> “&quot;Dan shall judge his people, As one of the tribes of
Israel. &quot;Dan shall be a serpent in the way, A horned snake in the path,
That bites the horse's heels, So that his rider falls backward.” (Genesis
49:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Jewish Dictator of Palestine also has many titles.
“The false prophet” in Revelation 16:13, Revelation 19:20, and Revelation
20:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon and out
of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three
unclean spirits like frogs;&quot;  (Revelation 16:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And the beast was seized, and with him the false prophet
who performed the signs in his presence, by which he deceived those who had
received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image; these two
were thrown alive into the lake of fire which burns with brimstone.&quot; 
(Revelation 19:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake
of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also; and they
will be tormented day and night forever and ever.&quot;  (Revelation 20:10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Another beast” in Revelation 13:11 or the “Second
beast.”</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth; and
he had two horns like a lamb and he spoke as a dragon.&quot;  (Revelation
13:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“A serpent” in Genesis 49:16-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Dan shall be a serpent in the way, A horned snake
in the path, That bites the horse's heels, So that his rider falls
backward.&quot;  (Genesis 49:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“The king” in Daniel 11:36-40.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Then the king will do as he pleases, and he will
exalt and magnify himself above every god and will speak monstrous things
against the God of gods; and he will prosper until the indignation is finished,
for that which is decreed will be done.&quot;  (Daniel 11:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A “serpent” and a “horned snake” in Genesis 49:17-18. He
is from the tribe of Dan and is the serpent that bites the horse’s heels. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Dan shall judge his people, As one of the tribes of
Israel. &quot;Dan shall be a serpent in the way, A horned snake in the path,
That bites the horse's heels, So that his rider falls backward.” (Genesis
49:16-17, NASB)</p>
