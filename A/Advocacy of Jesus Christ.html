<h2><a name="_Advocacy_of_Jesus"></a><a name="_D-Advocacy_of_Jesus"></a>Advocacy
of Jesus Christ</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is the believer’s defense attorney at all
times. He defends the believer against Satan’s attacks, whether or not that
believer has confessed their sins. The basis for this is Unlimited Atonement.
Jesus Christ bore the sins (pre-salvation and post-salvation sins) of the whole
world. 1 Peter 2:24; 2 Cor. 5:21; Rev. 1:5; Col. 2:14; Heb. 9:27-28.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, so that
we might die to sin and live to righteousness; for by His wounds you were
healed.”  (1 Peter 2:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of
the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To Him who loves us and
released us from our sins by His blood—”  (Revelation 1:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once and after
this comes judgment, so Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins
of many, will appear a second time for salvation without reference to sin, to
those who eagerly await Him.”  (Hebrews 9:27-28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Father judged all of our sins when Christ was
bearing them on the Cross. Psalms 22:1-6; 1 Peter 3:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the choir director; upon Aijeleth Hashshahar. A Psalm of
David. My God, my God, why have You forsaken me? Far from my deliverance are
the words of my groaning. O my God, I cry by day, but You do not answer; And by
night, but I have no rest. Yet You are holy, O You who are enthroned upon the
praises of Israel. In You our fathers trusted; They trusted and You delivered
them. To You they cried out and were delivered; In You they trusted and were
not disappointed. But I am a worm and not a man, A reproach of men and despised
by the people.”  (Psalms 22:1-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For Christ also died for sins once for all, the just for the
unjust, so that He might bring us to God, having been put to death in the
flesh, but made alive in the spirit;”  (1 Peter 3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Since mankind’s sins were judged once at the Cross, they
cannot be judged again. This is the law of double jeopardy. Rom. 6:10. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For the death that He died, He died to sin once for all; but
the life that He lives, He lives to God.”  (Romans 6:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Therefore, since you can only be judged once for a sin,
Satan’s accusation is thrown out of court. Jesus Christ was judged in your
place for your sin. Jesus Christ is our defense attorney and is seated at the
right hand of the Father where He defends us. 1 John 2:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“My little children, I am writing these things to you so that
you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus
Christ the righteous;”  (1 John 2:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer’s sins then become a family matter. The
believer gets disciplined by God when out of fellowship. If believers do not
confess their sins to God the Father using 1 John 1:9, they are subject to the
Father’s chastisement. Heb. 12:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
John 1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“FOR THOSE WHOM THE LORD LOVES HE DISCIPLINES, AND HE SCOURGES
EVERY SON WHOM HE RECEIVES.”“  (Hebrews 12:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The basis of His defense is 1 John 1:7. The Blood of
Jesus Christ keeps on cleansing from all sins.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but if we walk in the Light as He Himself is in the Light, we
have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us
from all sin.”  (1 John 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is representing us in heaven. We are
representing Him here on earth. Jesus Christ has never lost a case and never
will. His defense is always the same - the completed work of the Cross.</p>
