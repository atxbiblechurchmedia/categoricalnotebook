<h2><a name="_D-Anger"></a><a name="_Anger"></a>Anger </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Anger is an emotional mental attitude sin and expresses
antagonism, hatred, exasperation, resentment, and irrationality.  It can be
mental or emotional or both. Anger is always irrational. Like arrogance, anger
is a sin that motivates other sins.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Arrogance motivates emotional sins like jealousy,
bitterness, vindictiveness, hatred, implacability, revenge, and self-pity. 
Anger is the other side of the coin of jealousy.  Criminal activity is the
function of the arrogant and angry person.  Anger always adds wrong to wrong,
sin to sin.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers with arrogance may look down at others and hide
their anger until one day they explode at friends or loved ones. This is a
flawed character. This is a hidden anger instead of an outburst of anger.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b><span style='color:black'>God’s Anger is an
Anthropopathism</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>God cannot sin, therefore,
God’s anger cannot be sinful, emotional, or reactive. Anger in God is an
anthropopathism. Anthropopathisms reveal His qualities and express His essence,
divine policy, actions and decisions to the finite minds of mankind. Without
anthropopathisms, we could not have insight into God such as His perfect
essence and justice. God has no human qualities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>Anger is used many times in the
Bible as an anthropopathism in the phrase “The anger of the Lord.”  Num. 25:4;
Num. 32:14; Deut. 29:20; Judges 3:8; Judges 10:7; Judges 2:14; Judges 2:20; 2
Kings 24:20; Lam. 4:16; Jer. 4:8; Jer. 25:37; Jer. 30:24; Jer. 51:45; Jer. 52:3;
Zeph. 2:2-3; Psalms 2:5.</span></p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The LORD said to Moses, &quot;Take all the leaders of the
people and execute them in broad daylight before the LORD, so that the fierce
anger of the LORD may turn away from Israel.&quot;&quot;  (Numbers 25:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;For this, put on sackcloth, Lament and wail; For
the fierce anger of the LORD Has not turned back from us.&quot;&quot; 
(Jeremiah 4:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then He will speak to them in His anger And terrify them
in His fury, saying,&quot;  (Psalms 2:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>Anger is used many times in the
Bible as an anthropopathism in the phrase “the wrath of God”  or “the anger of
God”  Psalms 78:31; John 3:36; Rom. 1:18; Eph. 5:6; Col. 3:6; Rev. 14:10; Rev.
14:19; Rev. 15:1; Rev. 15:7; Rev. 16:1; Rev. 19:15.</span></p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The anger of God rose against them And killed some of
their stoutest ones, And subdued the choice men of Israel.&quot;  (Psalms
78:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all
ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in
unrighteousness,&quot;  (Romans 1:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For it is because of these things that the wrath of God
will come upon the sons of disobedience,&quot;  (Colossians 3:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b><span style='color:black'>Products of Anger</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>Anger is resentment of soul and
when perpetuated, it becomes irrationality of soul.  In Genesis 39:1-19,
Potiphar’s anger was irrational, which exemplifies his emotions controlling his
soul and therefore, his thinking. The solution to anger is to confess known
sins to the Father and thereby be filled with the Holy Spirit thus restoring
your fellowship with Jesus Christ. The filling of the Holy Spirit enables you
to go on with Bible doctrine rationales which will focus your thinking instead
of your emotions. </span></p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now when his master heard the words of his wife, which
she spoke to him, saying, &quot;This is what your slave did to me,&quot; his
anger burned.&quot;  (Genesis 39:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>Anger results in self-induced
misery and causes life to be an ordeal. Prov. 22:8. </span></p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He who sows iniquity will reap vanity, And the rod of his
fury will perish.&quot;  (Proverbs 22:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>Anger also produces chain
sinning and is the root of bitterness, hostility, and arrogance. This is
hidden, hypocritical anger. Heb. 12:15.</span></p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;See to it that no one comes short of the grace of God;
that no root of bitterness springing up causes trouble, and by it many be
defiled;&quot;  (Hebrews 12:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>Anger causes misery to others
around you. Proverbs 21:19 and Proverbs 25:24 present examples of a quarrelsome
and ill-tempered wife.  Proverbs 22:24 presents the hot-tempered man and the
mandate to separate from them. </span></p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;It is better to live in a desert land Than with a
contentious and vexing woman.&quot;  (Proverbs 21:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;It is better to live in a corner of the roof Than in a
house shared with a contentious woman.&quot;  (Proverbs 25:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Do not associate with a man given to anger; Or go with a
hot-tempered man,&quot;  (Proverbs 22:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>Anger can destroy a nation.
Amos 1:11.</span></p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Thus says the LORD, &quot;For three transgressions of
Edom and for four I will not revoke its punishment, Because he pursued his
brother with the sword, While he stifled his compassion; His anger also tore
continually, And he maintained his fury forever.&quot;  (Amos 1:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>Anger motivates jealousy and
cruelty.<b> </b>A person can’t be angry without being cruel and unfair. This is
a more permanent type of mental attitude sin from the old sin nature lust
patterns. The old sin nature produces arrogance, which produces jealousy, which
produces cruelty, which produces antagonism. Prov. 27:4.</span></p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Wrath is fierce and anger is a flood, But who can stand
before jealousy?&quot;  (Proverbs 27:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>Anger is related to stupidity
based on blind arrogance.<b> </b>Many believers with little Bible doctrine have
short fuses. A fool is one who has little <i>epignosis</i> doctrine in their
soul. These have a closed mind to everyone and they get mad at the drop of a
hat. A person is neither intelligent nor wise when angry, which is why so many
stupid, embarrassing, and regrettable things are said in anger. Anger causes
misery to those in the periphery of an angry person. Violent crime comes from
anger and bitterness. In the circumstances of life, you must have your wits
about you. You can’t be angry and be a thinking person. When anger explodes,
destructive anger and evil go together. Eccl. 7:9.</span></p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Do not be eager in your heart to be angry, For anger
resides in the bosom of fools.&quot;  (Ecclesiastes 7:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Anger is never an isolated sin. Prov. 29:22.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;An angry man stirs up strife, And a hot-tempered man
abounds in transgression.&quot;  (Proverbs 29:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>Anger is related to perpetual
carnality and grieving the Holy Spirit. Eph. 4:31; Col. 3:8.</span></p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and
slander be put away from you, along with all malice.&quot;  (Ephesians 4:31,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But now you also, put them all aside: anger, wrath,
malice, slander, and abusive speech from your mouth.&quot;  (Colossians 3:8,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>Anger is a sin from the old sin
nature. Gal. 5:19-20.</span></p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are:
immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife,
jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions,&quot; 
(Galatians 5:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>Anger frustrates effective
prayer and hinders intercession for others. 1 Tim. 2:8.</span></p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore I want the men in every place to pray, lifting
up holy hands, without wrath and dissension.&quot;  (1 Timothy 2:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>Anger can entail impersonal
antagonism such as using certain hand gestures toward someone who just cut you
off on the freeway and personal antagonism where you know the one who cut you
off. This can lead to resentment and irrationality of soul and a perpetual
anger where little Bible doctrine is left in the soul. Gen. 39:19.</span></p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now when his master heard the words of his wife, which
she spoke to him, saying, &quot;This is what your slave did to me,&quot; his
anger burned.&quot;  (Genesis 39:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>Solutions to anger are
confession of sin and gaining unconditional love toward others as you mature
spiritually. This unconditional love can only be motivated by personal love for
God. With Bible doctrine you can begin to overcome anger. With spiritual advance,
you shed anger.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Emotional Anger Involving Self </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EL>Θυμο</span>́<span lang=EL>ς</span> (<i>thumos</i>)
is boiling agitation of feeling or emotional turbulence, tantrums, and is
translated “wrath” in Ephesians 4:31. Wrath is emotional turbulence where the
emotions control the soul, otherwise known as emotional revolt of the soul. This
type of anger is forbidden and involves the emotions.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander
be put away from you, along with all malice.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 4:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Luke 4:28 describes those in the synagogue “filled with rage.”
All the people in the synagogue were furious when they heard this. The
Sanhedrin were emotionally angry and in their anger, like a mob, they threw
Jesus out! </p>

<p class=Verses>“And all the people in the synagogue were filled with rage as
they heard these things;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Luke 4:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 12:20, there were angry tempers. In Galatians
5:20, the believer was imitating the unbeliever. In Colossians 3:8, for
example, this “wrath” is not to be allowed in the local church. Eph. 4:31; Col.
3:8.</p>

<p class=Verses> “For I am afraid that perhaps when I come I may find you to be
not what I wish and may be found by you to be not what you wish; that perhaps
there will be strife, jealousy, angry tempers, disputes, slanders, gossip,
arrogance, disturbances;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Corinthians 12:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of
anger, disputes, dissensions, factions,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Galatians 5:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander
be put away from you, along with all malice.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 4:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But now you also, put them all aside: anger, wrath, malice,
slander, and abusive speech from your mouth.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Colossians 3:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Emotional Anger Involving Others</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EL>Παροργισμο</span>́<span lang=EL>ς</span> (<i>paragismos</i>)
is an emotional anger overflowing to others. It is emotional anger with
hostility to others and accompanied by antagonism, resentment, bitterness, and exasperation.
This anger is designed to make others angry. It is translated “anger” in
Ephesians 4:26. These emotional outbursts are forbidden. This is a mental
attitude sin anger where individuals are angry and they burn on the inside. </p>

<p class=Verses>“BE ANGRY, AND yet DO NOT SIN; do not let the sun go down on
your anger,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 4:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ephesians 6:4 is resentment, bitterness, and
exasperation of children due to parents not addressing their children’s
problems but attacking them personally. Correct teaching and discipline of your
children requires unconditional love and that requires some Bible doctrine in
the soul.</p>

<p class=Verses> “Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring
them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians
6:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Children have their own volition and this verse does not
promise you anything regarding your children. It means that when they are
mature (spiritually and physically), they will not depart from what you taught
them. The children will decide for themselves. Many grow up negative and stay
that way forever. Positive volition can overcome any flaw, environmental,
genetic, and volitional. The old sin nature controlling the soul means emotions
controlling the soul and emotions react. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Righteous Indignation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Righteous indignation is not an emotional anger. It is a
good understanding of a bad situation.  Righteous indignation is response to
unfair treatment by concentration on your relationship with God. Reaction to
unfair treatment leads to anger and sin.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EL>Ο</span>̓<span lang=EL>ργη</span>́ (<i>orgē</i>)
is a mental attitude of anger and can be legitimate ­or can be used in a wrong
manner which becomes mental attitude arrogance. Legitimate <i>orge</i> is
commanded and is legitimate when guided by Bible doctrine. In Mark 3:5, Jesus
Christ had righteous indignation and felt sorry for the blindness of the
Pharisees. Mental attitude of anger is legitimate when guided by Bible doctrine
and is known as virtuous wrath. We should feel sorry for those people who are
in error. This is true compassion.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;After looking around at them with anger, grieved at their
hardness of heart, He said to the man, &quot;Stretch out your hand.&quot; And
he stretched it out, and his hand was restored.&quot;  (Mark 3:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>Righteous indignation is
resentment of anything anti-Bible doctrine and anti-God. This is not a sin.
Virtuous wrath is mandated by the Word of God. You are commanded to resent
anything that is anti-doctrine or that opposes God. However, you must apply it
carefully with unconditional love. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Mark 10:14, Jesus became righteously opposed to His
disciples when they forbad the children to be brought to Him. This was not
anger, but an understanding of a wrong and expressing that He felt it was
completely inappropriate. Here, the Greek word for “indignant” is <span
lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>γανακτε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(aganakteō) and means to be indignant, moved with indignation, to be very
displeased.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But when Jesus saw this, He was indignant and said to
them, &quot;Permit the children to come to Me; do not hinder them; for the
kingdom of God belongs to such as these. &quot;  (Mark 10:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ expressed righteous indignation in Matthew
23:13-36 when describing the hypocrisy of the Scribes and Pharisees.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites,
because you shut off the kingdom of heaven from people; for you do not enter in
yourselves, nor do you allow those who are entering to go in. &quot;  (Matthew
23:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ wasn’t angry when He said to Peter in
Matthew 16:23, “Get behind Me, Satan!” </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But He turned and said to Peter, &quot;Get behind Me,
Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me; for you are not setting your mind on
God's interests, but man's.&quot; &quot;  (Matthew 16:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 13:9-11, Paul deals with a demon possessed
person, Elymas the magician, and presents what this man stood for.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But Saul, who was also known as Paul, filled with the
Holy Spirit, fixed his gaze on him, and said, &quot;You who are full of all
deceit and fraud, you son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will
you not cease to make crooked the straight ways of the Lord? &quot;Now, behold,
the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will be blind and not see the sun for
a time.&quot; And immediately a mist and a darkness fell upon him, and he went
about seeking those who would lead him by the hand.&quot;  (Acts 13:9-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This does not grieve the Holy Spirit. It is a mental
attitude of resentment toward heresy. It is a mental attitude of resentment
toward legalism. It is a mental attitude of resentment toward unbelief. It is a
mental attitude of resentment toward religion or anything antagonistic to the
Word. It also can be used in a wrong manner.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Mental Attitude Anger</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The wrong use of <i>orge</i> is resentment that is
definitely a mental attitude sin from arrogance. Eph. 4:31; Col. 3:8; Matt.
5:22; Luke 14:21; Luke 15:28; Eph. 4:26; Rev. 11:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>““But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother
shall be guilty before the court; and whoever says to his brother, ‘You
good-for-nothing,’ shall be guilty before the supreme court; and whoever says, ‘You
fool,’ shall be guilty enough to go into the fiery hell.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew
5:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““And the slave came back and reported this to his master. Then
the head of the household became angry and said to his slave, ‘Go out at once
into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in here the poor and crippled
and blind and lame.’”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Luke 14:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““But he became angry and was not willing to go in; and his
father came out and began pleading with him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Luke 15:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““And the nations were enraged, and Your wrath came, and the
time came for the dead to be judged, and the time to reward Your bond-servants
the prophets and the saints and those who fear Your name, the small and the
great, and to destroy those who destroy the earth.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation
11:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Continual anger produces bitterness or vindictiveness.
Vindictiveness results in verbal outbursts and desire for retaliation. The
believer in fellowship should respond to unfairness or maltreatment or gossip
from others, without sin by applying Bible doctrine to the situation.  You
should put the matter in the Lord’s hands. When maltreated, never let reaction
to maltreatment become sin.  If you retaliate, then your reaction becomes
anger. Never let reaction become sin.</p>
