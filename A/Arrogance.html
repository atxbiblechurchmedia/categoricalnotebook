<h2><a name="_Arrogance"></a>Arrogance</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Arrogance or pride is a basic mental attitude sin. It is
a state of self-esteem, lofty self-respect for real or imagined reasons, real
or imagined superiority. Arrogance includes vanity, empty pride, excessive
desire for attention, approval or praise, conceit, and haughtiness. Arrogance
was the original sin of Satan and motivation at the time of his fall. Isaiah
14:12-14<span lang=HE dir=RTL>ְ</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span>
Ezekiel 28:14-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;How you have fallen from heaven, O star of the
morning, son of the dawn! You have been cut down to the earth, You who have
weakened the nations! &quot;But you said in your heart, 'I will ascend to
heaven; I will raise my throne above the stars of God, And I will sit on the
mount of assembly In the recesses of the north. 'I will ascend above the
heights of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.'&quot;  (Isaiah
14:12-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;You were the anointed cherub who covers, And I
placed you there. You were on the holy mountain of God; You walked in the midst
of the stones of fire. &quot;You were blameless in your ways From the day you
were created Until unrighteousness was found in you. &quot;By the abundance of
your trade You were internally filled with violence, And you sinned; Therefore
I have cast you as profane From the mountain of God. And I have destroyed you,
O covering cherub, From the midst of the stones of fire. &quot;Your heart was
lifted up because of your beauty; You corrupted your wisdom by reason of your
splendor. I cast you to the ground; I put you before kings, That they may see
you.&quot;  (Ezekiel 28:14-17, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The sin of arrogance is the greatest hindrance to love in
any category. Pride eliminates your sense of integrity or objectivity, justice,
and fairness. You become subjective and don't have true capacity for love. You
love yourself more than anyone else. You lose your sense of humor.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Pride is the worst sin. The most powerful mental attitude
sin is jealousy. These two often go together. God warns against pride in 1
Timothy 3:6. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; and not a new convert, so that he will not become
conceited and fall into the condemnation incurred by the devil.&quot;  (1
Timothy 3:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The arrogant believer becomes unteachable. 1 Tim. 6:3-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If anyone advocates a different doctrine and does not
agree with sound words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ, and with the doctrine
conforming to godliness, he is conceited and understands nothing; but he has a
morbid interest in controversial questions and disputes about words, out of
which arise envy, strife, abusive language, evil suspicions,&quot;  (1 Timothy
6:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Arrogance is related to other sins. 2 Tim. 3:2; Rom.
1:30.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money,
boastful, arrogant, revilers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful,
unholy,&quot;  (2 Timothy 3:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful,
inventors of evil, disobedient to parents,&quot;  (Romans 1:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Arrogance precedes a fall. Prov. 16:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Pride goes before destruction, And a haughty spirit
before stumbling.&quot;  (Proverbs 16:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Pride is related to national divine discipline. 2 Chron.
32:26.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;However, Hezekiah humbled the pride of his heart, both he
and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD did not come on
them in the days of Hezekiah.&quot;  (2 Chronicles 32:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Pride is the trigger mechanism for evil and reversionism.
Psalms 10:2-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;In pride the wicked hotly pursue the afflicted; Let them
be caught in the plots which they have devised. For the wicked boasts of his
heart's desire, And the greedy man curses and spurns the LORD. The wicked, in
the haughtiness of his countenance, does not seek Him. All his thoughts are,
&quot;There is no God.&quot;&quot;  (Psalms 10:2-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Self-righteousness is a manifestation of pride. Because
arrogance produces subjectivity, you can’t properly use authority. Nations are
destroyed if arrogance grows too much. Lev. 26:19; Hosea 7:10-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;'I will also break down your pride of power; I will also
make your sky like iron and your earth like bronze.&quot;  (Leviticus 26:19,
NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Though the pride of Israel testifies against him, Yet
they have not returned to the LORD their God, Nor have they sought Him, for all
this. So Ephraim has become like a silly dove, without sense; They call to
Egypt, they go to Assyria. When they go, I will spread My net over them; I will
bring them down like the birds of the sky. I will chastise them in accordance
with the proclamation to their assembly. Woe to them, for they have strayed
from Me! Destruction is theirs, for they have rebelled against Me! I would
redeem them, but they speak lies against Me. And they do not cry to Me from
their heart When they wail on their beds; For the sake of grain and new wine
they assemble themselves, They turn away from Me.&quot;  (Hosea 7:10-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Slandering comes from pride. Positive volition to the
Word of God protects your soul from pride.  1 Sam. 2:3; Job 33:16-17; Prov.
11:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Boast no more so very proudly, Do not let arrogance
come out of your mouth; For the LORD is a God of knowledge, And with Him
actions are weighed.&quot;  (1 Samuel 2:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then He opens the ears of men, And seals their
instruction, That He may turn man aside from his conduct, And keep man from
pride;&quot;  (Job 33:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When pride comes, then comes dishonor, But with the
humble is wisdom.&quot;  (Proverbs 11:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>True humility means you have learned to hate arrogance
and the evil it produces. Prov. 8:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;The fear of the LORD is to hate evil; Pride and
arrogance and the evil way And the perverted mouth, I hate.&quot;  (Proverbs
8:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The maturing believer’s soul becomes changed by the Holy
Spirit and learns to recognize pride and to quickly correct their thinking via
confession of sin.</p>
