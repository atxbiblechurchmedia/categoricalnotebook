<h2><a name="_Maximum_Adversity,_Believer’s"></a>Maximum Adversity, Believer’s
Triumph – Part 2</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Zayin File - The Word of God is a Weapon</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew letter Zayin represents a weapon. The weapon
is the Word of God. It is not only an offensive weapon against others, but it
also refreshes just as target practice with a hand gun can be relaxing. The
Word of God as a weapon provides refreshment and relaxation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:49, “Remember” is the qal imperative of <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>זכר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(zâkar) and means to call to remembrance,
to have Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the soul and in this case in the
frame of reference. The ability to recall.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Zayin. Remember the word to Your servant, In which You
have made me hope.&quot;  (Psalms 119:49, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“The word to Your servant” means he is asking the Lord to
help him recall the Word he received when he previously had done his homework.
Remember, he is under terrific pressure. “You have made me hope” is the hiphil
imperfect and means to cause me to keep on with faith-rest under maximum
pressure.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:50, “This is my comfort” refers to usable
doctrine resident in the right lobe of the soul. The Word of God provides inner
comfort and inner strength during times of disaster. “My affliction” refers to
his present trial. “Your word has revived me” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>חָיָה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(chayah) and means to take in oxygen, to
be refreshed by oxygen, to live. Using the grace apparatus for perception
results in soul refreshment. Daily it is often the thing that is left out.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;This is my comfort in my affliction, That Your word has
revived me.&quot;  (Psalms 119:50, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:51, “The arrogant utterly deride me” refers
to the Chaldean soldiers who make fun of him and scorn him. “I do not turn
aside from Your law” means he has not veered, has no mental attitude sins, no
sins of the tongue, and no overt sinful activity. Therefore, he is stabilized
and oriented to the Word of God resident in his soul.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The arrogant utterly deride me, Yet I do not turn aside
from Your law.&quot;  (Psalms 119:51, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:52, “I have remembered Your ordinances from
of old” refers to the Mosaic Law. Here, it is Bible doctrine recalled under the
circumstances. He is remembering the times before the invasion when he could be
at home and learn Bible doctrine under relaxed circumstances. The good old
days, the days when we had Bible doctrine around here.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I have remembered Your ordinances from of old, O LORD,
And comfort myself.&quot;  (Psalms 119:52, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Comfort myself” means he is using his inner spiritual
resources where he calls upon the premises, techniques, doctrines, and
principles of the Word of God. “Myself” comes from the hithpael stem and is
reflexive. He is not dependent upon anyone else at this point. He is
spiritually self-sustaining. And, yes, this is in a young person.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:53 is a terrible test. “Burning indignation
has seized me” refers to the brutality of a death march. He is at the mercy of
the soldiers. The indignation has seized him suddenly and without warning.
Every great disaster you face is without warning. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Burning indignation has seized me because of the wicked,
Who forsake Your law.&quot;  (Psalms 119:53, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Unexpected disaster will hit a nation when they forfeit
their freedom for promises of peace and security. Then, seemingly out of
nowhere comes sudden destruction. “The wicked” refers to the brutal Chaldean
soldiers who ignored the principles of morality, the divine institutions, and
salvation. They were animals.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:54, “Your statutes” refers to Bible
doctrine arranged into categories in the right lobe of the soul ready to go. “Are
my songs” is the inner melody of his life that is Bible doctrine. Eph. 5:19.
Doctrine is the basis for true singing. “In the house of my pilgrimage” is an
idiom for a foreign country. He is out of his own land as in Psalms 137.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Your statutes are my songs In the house of my
pilgrimage.&quot;  (Psalms 119:54, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual
songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord;&quot;  (Ephesians
5:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:55, “I remember Your name” refers to the
person of Jesus Christ. “In the night” are the night hours where he was too
bruised to sleep, it was too noisy and too horrible. “And keep Your law” means
he has not dishonored the Word of God.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;O LORD, I remember Your name in the night, And keep Your
law.&quot;  (Psalms 119:55, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:56, “This has become mine” refers to the
death march in which he sees the Lord’s mercy and grace in action. Imagine
saying that in the midst of a horrible death march. “I observe Your precepts”
means he has applied the Bible doctrine from his soul. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;This has become mine, That I observe Your
precepts.&quot;  (Psalms 119:56, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Heth File – The Believer’s Protection</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew letter Heth refers to an enclosure or a fence.
This represents the grace of God protecting the believer on earth rather than
taking them home. God has provided for every situation in life until He takes
you home to eternity. God has provided for every disaster in time. God puts a
fence of Bible doctrine within and without for the believer.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:57, “my portion” is him keeping the Word by
living by it, letting it uphold him, relying on it, and letting God's grace
protect and strengthen him through it all.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Heth. The LORD is my portion; I have promised to keep
Your words.&quot;  (Psalms 119:57, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:58, “I sought Your favor with all my heart”
means he made a special appeal from his soul for God's grace. God always treats
us in grace, no matter what the circumstances. “Be gracious to me according to
Your word” is the qal imperative and means on a standard with Your Word. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I sought Your favor with all my heart; Be gracious to me
according to Your word.&quot;  (Psalms 119:58, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers who believe their works will cause God to
bestow His grace on them will say, “The Lord has been rough on me.” The grace
oriented believer says, “The Lord has been gracious to me.” What is your
security? Upon what or who do you depend? Bible doctrine or your ability to
work, your ability to scheme, your ability to operate some deal?</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:59, “I considered my ways” refers to an
introspective self-examination of the believer’s spiritual growth status.  “And
turned my feet” is the hiphil imperfect of <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שׁוּב</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(shûb) and is a reference to confession
of sin to God the Father and the resultant recovery of fellowship with God.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I considered my ways And turned my feet to Your
testimonies.&quot;  (Psalms 119:59, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:60, “I hastened” is positive volition and
means he hurried to get Bible doctrine in a crash program. He didn’t let
anything stand in the way of Bible doctrine so he could have inner confidence
that he was living by the Word and in the Word.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I hastened and did not delay To keep Your
commandments.&quot;  (Psalms 119:60, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Psalms 119:61 presents opposition of the wicked. “The
cords of the wicked have encircled me” means they abused him and violated his
privacy. He stood for grace and got opposition. “I have not forgotten Your law”
means he was determined to stay in fellowship during the assault even though he
was going through hell.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The cords of the wicked have encircled me, But I have not
forgotten Your law.&quot;  (Psalms 119:61, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:62, “At midnight” means that by midnight
the abuse was over. “I shall rise to give thanks to You” is gratitude toward
God based on God's grace resources enabling him to maintain his grace
orientation through the abuse. The soul remained intact, but the body was
battered. “Because of Your righteous ordinances” means that he knew that the
Lord would take care of the Babylonians and the Lord would provide.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;At midnight I shall rise to give thanks to You Because of
Your righteous ordinances.&quot;  (Psalms 119:62, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:63, “I am a companion of all those who fear
You” means he declared himself to be on the side of those with Bible doctrine.
This was his Bible class. “Fear” refers to respect for the Word of God and
fellowship with other believer prisoners who were using faith-rest. “Your
precepts” refers to Bible doctrine stored categorically in the soul.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I am a companion of all those who fear You, And of those
who keep Your precepts.&quot;  (Psalms 119:63, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:64, “The earth is full of Your
lovingkindness.” Why? Because inside the believer, the Lord develops perfect
environment of the soul. He carried his environment with him through the death
march. Bible doctrine in his soul enabled him to have the proper mental
attitude. “Teach me Your statutes” means he wanted to know more Bible doctrine.
He just couldn’t get enough. Once you taste doctrine, you want more and more
and more. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The earth is full of Your lovingkindness, O LORD; Teach
me Your statutes.&quot;  (Psalms 119:64, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Teth File - Relationship</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew letter Teth refers to the concept of
relationship. The word “good” stands out. You should know the difference
between divine good and human good.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:65, “You have dealt well” is <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>עָשָׂה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(asah) and means to make something out of
something. He is saying that the Lord has taken care of him on the death march.
Sooner or later you are going to hit maximum disaster. But you won’t be ready
for it unless your attitude toward Bible doctrine is improved. Rom. 8:28</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Teth. You have dealt well with Your servant, O LORD,
according to Your word.&quot;  (Psalms 119:65, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And we know that God causes all things to work together
for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His
purpose.&quot;  (Romans 8:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“With Your servant” indicates relationship with the Lord.
“According to Your word” means according to the Word of God - Bible doctrine.
The principle here is that every believer has a relationship with the Lord, but
only those believers who know the Word appreciate it and make use of God's
grace resources identified in the Word.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:66, “Teach me good discernment and
knowledge” means discernment that accompanies <i>epignosis</i> knowledge in the
soul. This is ability to think with the principles and promises of Bible
doctrine under disaster conditions. It is the ability to take in God’s Word and
use it under pressure when needed. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Teach me good discernment and knowledge, For I believe in
Your commandments.&quot;  (Psalms 119:66, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Teach” is the piel imperative of <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>למד</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(lâmad) and means to teach over and over with
authority, to learn under adversity, intensive teaching under intensive
pressure. He has believed the Bible doctrine and has applied it to his life. He
understands it well.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:67, “Before I was afflicted” was before the
fifth cycle of discipline had hit the nation. “I went astray” means he wandered
from the things that he knew. “But now I keep Your word” is the qal perfect of <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שׁמר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(shâmar) and means to guard, to protect,
to keep. He has kept the Word.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Before I was afflicted I went astray, But now I keep Your
word.&quot;  (Psalms 119:67, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:68, “You are good” refers to the character
of God, the plan of God, the will of God, and the person and work of Christ.
God has manufactured good out of disaster because He is intrinsic good. He knew
Bible doctrine, had wandered from it, but came back to it through disaster.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;You are good and do good; Teach me Your statutes.&quot; 
(Psalms 119:68, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“And do good” means to cause good to come out of
disaster. For example, the bones of Joseph in Genesis 50. What if you and some
others you know were chained together? It would be a delight to be chained to
some, but a real drag with others. “Teach me Your statutes” means to teach the
categories of Bible doctrine so your soul cannot be swept away by disaster.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:69, “the arrogant” are the Chaldean
soldiers. “Have forged” means they have accused him falsely. “With all my heart
I will observe Your precepts” means he will apply all of the Bible doctrine he
has in the compartments of the right lobe of his soul, in his frame of
reference, his memory center, his conscience, and his norms and standards from
the viewpoint of his knowledge of the will of God.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The arrogant have forged a lie against me; With all my
heart I will observe Your precepts.&quot;  (Psalms 119:69, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:70, “Their heart is covered with fat”
refers to the Chaldean soldier’s soul. This is an idiom for stupidity of the
soul.  Their self-consciousness was filled with great pride, they were the
victors, they were in the driver’s seat and were in control. Their mentality
was full of mental attitude sins. Their volition was used to decide how to
amuse themselves with the captives. Their emotions were in emotional revolt,
they wanted anything sensual, their emotions ran them. The conscience was that of
animals, brutal. Their old sin natures were out of control. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Their heart is covered with fat, But I delight in Your
law.&quot;  (Psalms 119:70, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They had stupid, insensitive, distorted, and twisted
souls. Here the victim is stable, but the soldiers are unstable. “But I delight
in Your law” refers to his rapport love with Bible doctrine and God's statutes
and promises. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:71, “It is good for me that I was
afflicted” refers to the spiritual growth that results of from testing. “Learn
Your statutes” refers to categorical Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the
soul. It is one thing to know Bible stories, but quite another to know the
doctrines of Scripture. Rom. 8:28.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;It is good for me that I was afflicted, That I may learn
Your statutes.&quot;  (Psalms 119:71, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And we know that God causes all things to work together
for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His
purpose.&quot;  (Romans 8:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:72, “The law of Your mouth” is the content
of Bible doctrine which he felt was better for him than having great monetary
wealth. Bible doctrine was better, more pleasant, more agreeable, and more
profitable to him in extreme testing than a great amount of gold and silver.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The law of Your mouth is better to me Than thousands of
gold and silver pieces.&quot;  (Psalms 119:72, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Yod File – God's Plan, Power, and Eternal Security </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew letter Yod refers to the hand or the authority
of God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:73, “Your hands” refers to the hands of
God. This is used in many ways, to show His plan, His power, and the eternal
security He provides. The hands of the Creator are alluded to as well as the
hands of the Savior. He is telling what doctrine has done for him. This is the
turning point. Remember what they learned in the home. He looks back over the
years and recalls his first Bible class.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Yodh. Your hands made me and fashioned me; Give me
understanding, that I may learn Your commandments.&quot;  (Psalms 119:73, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Made me” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>עָשָׂה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>(asah) and means to make something out of something. This refers to the
Lord as a potter who is molding him. This is a reference to the Lord allowing
certain things to come into his path that keeps him strong and keeps him
growing spiritually. “Fashioned me” is in the piel stem of <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>כּוּן</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(kûn) and means to stabilize. This is the
Word cycling within the right lobe of his soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Give me understanding” is the hiphil causative of <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>בּין</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(bı̂yn) and means to be caused to recall
something that has already been learned. He is beginning to cycle the doctrine
that is in his soul for application to what is going on around him and to him.
“That I may learn Your commandments” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>למד</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>(lâmad) to learn with a frame of reference so that one can communicate
that truth to others.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Psalms 119:74 shows the encouragement that a believer can
have on others. “May those who fear You see me and be glad” refers to the other
believers on the death march who will be glad to see the young man who is
operating on Bible doctrine. Philemon 1:6. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;May those who fear You see me and be glad, Because I wait
for Your word.&quot;  (Psalms 119:74, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and I pray that the fellowship of your faith may become
effective through the knowledge of every good thing which is in you for
Christ's sake.&quot;  (Philemon 1:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Often during the night, prisoners would die or be weak
and be cut loose to die. He would always be alive as an encouragement to others
and a token of the grace of God. “Because I wait for Your word” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>יחל</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(yâchal) and means to trust under maximum
pressure.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Psalms 119:75 presents the greatest testimony you can
have as a believer. “I know” is the qal perfect of <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>ידע</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(yâda‛) and means comprehension, to learn under an
academic situation. This learning was a completed action in past time. “Your
judgments are righteous” means he understands the essence of God.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I know, O LORD, that Your judgments are righteous, And
that in faithfulness You have afflicted me.&quot;  (Psalms 119:75, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“That in faithfulness” means he understands the essence
of God and His character. He knows that God is immutable and cannot change. He
also knows that knowing His character through the intake and application of
Bible doctrine stabilizes the believer. “You have afflicted me” means he sees
divine viewpoint in his afflictions. Even when the Lord disciplines you, He is
faithful.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:76, “O may Your lovingkindness comfort me”
means he wants to let grace be his comfort. What does he want for comfort? What
would you want for comfort? The right man for you? The right woman for you? A
new home that is paid for? A new car? More clothes? What comforts you? What
does he want for comfort? He wants the Word of God which is inherently usable
for dealing with problems.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;O may Your lovingkindness comfort me, According to Your
word to Your servant.&quot;  (Psalms 119:76, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He applies the Word to himself before others. We must
remember this. You get Bible doctrine from His Word. God enables you through
the power of the Holy Spirit to handle everything. “According to Your word to
Your servant” means that he is going to communicate Bible doctrine from his
soul to others. The only answer to problems and bad situations then and now is
the Word of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:77, “May Your compassion come to me” means
he is asking for more grace. He doesn’t ask for food, physical comfort,
protection or that the disaster be removed. He asks for more of God's grace. “That
I may live” refers to his reason that he wants to live. That reason is that he
loves Bible doctrine and the opportunity to communicate it. What else is there
to live for?</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;May Your compassion come to me that I may live, For Your
law is my delight.&quot;  (Psalms 119:77, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:78, “May the arrogant be ashamed, for they
subvert me with a lie” is a prayer that the arrogant brutal Babylonian soldiers
will become confused, not ashamed. They have dealt with him badly without
cause. He put the matter entirely into the Lord’s hands.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;May the arrogant be ashamed, for they subvert me with a
lie; But I shall meditate on Your precepts.&quot;  (Psalms 119:78, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:79, “May those who fear You turn to me”
means he is occupied with Christ in his soul and prays that they will turn to
him to teach them Bible doctrine. He prays that they will listen and have
positive volition. “Even those who know Your testimonies” means all these
believers need to be built up. His burden is for believers.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;May those who fear You turn to me, Even those who know
Your testimonies.&quot;  (Psalms 119:79, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:80, “May my heart be blameless in Your
statutes” refers to categorically presented Bible doctrine in his soul’s frame
of reference, his memory center, his conscience containing doctrinal norms and
standards, and in his viewpoint – divine viewpoint. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;May my heart be blameless in Your statutes, So that I
will not be ashamed.&quot;  (Psalms 119:80, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“So that I will not be ashamed” means that he prays that
he might not mislead. He wants to be accurate. Thus, he is in the Lord’s hands,
the Lord has a purpose for his life and he is beginning to enable him to
realize it.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Kaph File – We Are in His Plan Forever</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Kaph is the Hebrew letter representing the hollow or
palm of a hand. This file refers to the fact that we are in God's plan as long
as we live. Being in the plan of God doesn’t depend upon you, it depends upon
God’s character. It de-emphasizes who and what we are. Our only qualification
for the grace of God is that we are alive.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Before we can learn doctrine, we need to unlearn
tradition and prejudice. We need to get off of our emotional revolt, our guilt
complexes, and our inferiority complexes that say; “God can never use me.” When
we say such a thing, we are saying in effect that God cannot meet our failures
and our sinfulness.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This country is full of pride. It is full of Christians
who say when you have committed certain types of sins, you are all washed up.
“The bird with the broken pinion will never fly again.” If you are alive right
now, God has a plan specifically for you and you have more yet to do. God takes
you home when your work on earth is completed, not one second before. Get off
of this weird idea that you are important. It’s not about your talent, your
good looks, your scintillating personality, or your self-important life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:81, “My soul languishes” refers to
emotional revolt in the soul. Self-pity in your self-consciousness. When you
get mad in your mentality against someone in the local church, you say “That
church is going to the dogs.” A fainting soul always turns everything into hurt
ego.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Kaph. My soul languishes for Your salvation; I wait for
Your word.&quot;  (Psalms 119:81, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>With respects to volition, a fainting soul always makes a
lot of hot-headed and ridiculous decisions. In emotional revolt, there are
tantrum activities, panic palace, and getting into apostate activities like the
tongues movement. In the conscience, this involves getting into some taboo
movement. This is your emotions controlling your thinking.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“For Your salvation” refers to deliverance. You are not
to entertain the sins of the soul, your soul kinks. You are to confess the sins
to God the Father and enjoy the resulting fellowship. There is no place for
compensating for your sins, or “making it up to God,” or promising you will do
better. The principle here is that a fainting soul is a believer who is alive,
but who has not even gotten to the point of confession of sin. “I wait for Your
word” is the greatest virtue in the Christian life - to know the Word of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:82, “My eyes fail with longing for Your
word” means his eyes were exhausted. This is an indication of a tired mind and
extreme mental and physical exhaustion. They were suffering from lack of sleep.
They were suffering from lack of food. They were suffering from mental
exhaustion. They were suffering from physical exhaustion. He was so exhausted
he couldn’t think straight.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;My eyes fail with longing for Your word, While I say,
&quot;When will You comfort me?&quot;&quot;  (Psalms 119:82, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ways have been found to break a man down by keeping them
from sleep so they shine bright lights in their eyes and make them sit up all
night. “When will You comfort me?” isn’t a question, but he is praying; “When I
am receiving comfort.” The piel stem means his comfort came from inner soul
resources. Rom. 8:25. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But if we hope for what we do not see, with perseverance
we wait eagerly for it.&quot;  (Romans 8:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He doesn’t have a thing he can depend upon from the
outside. In all this exhaustion, the enabling power of the Holy Spirit
sustained him. The Holy Spirit enabled him to recall the Bible doctrine in his
soul even under extreme conditions. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is God the Holy Spirit sustaining the believer just
as the Holy Spirit sustained our Lord hanging on the Cross when God the Father
had forsaken our Lord in order to impute the sins of the world to His body and
then to judge them. The enabling power of the Holy Spirit with the Bible
doctrine in the right lobe of your soul empowers your spiritual life like the
very air you breathe for your physical life. Psalms 138:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I will bow down toward Your holy temple And give thanks
to Your name for Your lovingkindness and Your truth; For You have magnified
Your word according to all Your name.&quot;  (Psalms 138:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:83-85, even under extreme physical and
mental hardship, there are fragrances of memories. We are to live our lives one
day at a time depending entirely on God's grace resources. This is our mandate
even when we receive persecution from people with mental attitude sins. This
maybe the hardest spiritual test of them all.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Though I have become like a wineskin in the smoke, I do
not forget Your statutes. How many are the days of Your servant? When will You
execute judgment on those who persecute me? The arrogant have dug pits for me,
Men who are not in accord with Your law.&quot;  (Psalms 119:83-85, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:86-88, when we are under undeserved
suffering, our Lord understands. People are often unfair. Even when premature
death seemed imminent, the Lord was his strength. We are to use God's grace
resources to keep our thinking true to the Word that is in us.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;All Your commandments are faithful; They have persecuted
me with a lie; help me! They almost destroyed me on earth, But as for me, I did
not forsake Your precepts. Revive me according to Your lovingkindness, So that
I may keep the testimony of Your mouth.&quot;  (Psalms 119:86-88, NASB)</p>
