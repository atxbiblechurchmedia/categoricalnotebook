<h2><a name="_Adam_1"></a>Adam </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Adam’s Condition in Perfect Environment: Innocence</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Adam was created with a perfect physical body. He had a
human spirit and could understand spiritual information taught to him by Jesus
Christ in the Garden. He was also aware of God and His attributes. He had a
perfect sinless soul. In his soul, he had self-consciousness, thus he was conscious
of Eve and of her beauty, etc. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Adam also had mentality in his soul and named the
animals, had vocabulary, and thought. Adam also had emotion and could appreciate
Eve, the Garden, the fruit there and God's grace. Most importantly, Adam had
free will or volition. He had the capacity to sin (volition), but not the
nature to sin. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Adam’s Condition After He Sinned: Relative
Righteousness (-R) </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>After the fall, Adam’s body was outwardly the same, but he
had started to age. Adam’s soul still had the five characteristics of the soul,
but now an Old Sin Nature was added. The Old Sin Nature was received by his act
of negative volition. Rom. 3:23; Rom. 5:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
3:23, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world,
and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned—”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
5:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Adam’s lost fellowship with God when he decided to sin
and was then spiritually dead. At the same time, Adam’s human spirit died. All he
had left was fellowship with Eve with both in a state of sin. Gen. 2:17; Eph.
2:1; Eph. 2:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall
not eat, for in the day that you eat from it you will surely die.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis
2:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And you were dead in your trespasses and sins,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians
2:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive
together with Christ (by grace you have been saved),”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians
2:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Adam now had no functioning human spirit. Adam and his
descendants would also lack any human spirit, when born physically. Upon
acceptance of the work of Jesus Christ for our sins, each believer receives a
human spirit at the moment of salvation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Adam’s Condition after Salvation: Absolute
Righteousness (+R) </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Salvation is provided by God through the shedding of the blood
of Jesus Christ – His substitutionary spiritual death for our sins on the
Cross. Isaiah 61:10; Gen. 3:21; Heb. 9:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I will rejoice greatly in the LORD, My soul will exult in my
God; For He has clothed me with garments of salvation, He has wrapped me with a
robe of righteousness, As a bridegroom decks himself with a garland, And as a
bride adorns herself with her jewels.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah 61:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife, and
clothed them.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis 3:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And according to the Law, one may almost say, all things are cleansed
with blood, and without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews
9:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Adam’s body outwardly was the same, but continued to age
until physical death. Adam had a soul and a newly functioning human spirit
along with self-consciousness, volition, emotion, conscience, and mentality in
his soul. The soul has essence. The old sin nature is retained after salvation
and is the distorter of the soul. Heb. 4:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any
two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of
both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the
heart.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The human spirit is given at the point of salvation (not
reactivated). The believer is trichotomous (body, soul, and spirit). An
unbeliever is dichotomous (body and soul). The human race receives their old
sin natures genetically, no volition is involved. Rom. 8:16; 1 Thess. 5:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are
children of God,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 8:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you entirely; and
may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame at the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Thessalonians 5:23, NASB)</p>
