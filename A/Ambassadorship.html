<h2>Ambassadorship</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>An ambassador is an official
envoy or diplomatic agent of the highest rank sent to a foreign government or
sovereign as the resident representative of their government or sovereign or
appointed for a special and often temporary diplomatic assignment. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>All believers in the Church Age
are members of the body of Christ who are representatives of our Lord while on
this earth. We are His personal ambassadors or representatives because at
salvation, God the Holy Spirit placed each of us into union with our Lord Jesus
Christ. This is called the Baptism of the Holy Spirit. We represent ourselves
before God as believer priests and we represent God before mankind. 2 Cor. 5:20;
Eph. 6:19-20.</span></p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were
making an appeal through us; we beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to
God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Corinthians 5:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and pray on my behalf, that utterance may be given to me in
the opening of my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel,
for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in proclaiming it I may speak
boldly, as I ought to speak.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 6:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>As ambassadors, each believer
constantly represents our Lord in this world. There is no time off. Each
believer functions differently based on their spiritual growth, their spiritual
gifts, and the time in which they live. Each of us in an independent ambassador
in that we rely on nothing but the <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in our soul
and the grace of God. We do not rely on others. Your functions as ambassador
are fulfilled as you mature in the spiritual life. </span>Rom. 12:9-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil; cling
to what is good. Be devoted to one another in brotherly love; give preference
to one another in honor; not lagging behind in diligence, fervent in spirit,
serving the Lord;&quot;  (Romans 12:9-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An ambassador does not appoint himself. Every believer is
appointed His ambassador by the Lord and is provided the enabling power of the
Holy Spirit to function as a true ambassador for Jesus Christ. An ambassador
does not support themselves. God provides all our needs with His grace
resources. Phil. 4:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And my God will supply all your needs according to His riches
in glory in Christ Jesus.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Philippians 4:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An ambassador does not belong to the country where they
are sent. The believer is not of the world, but of heaven. An ambassador has
instructions in written form. The Word of God is for believers which is the
mind of Christ. 1 Cor. 2:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT
HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The ambassador does not live in the foreign country for
their own personal interests. We live here on earth solely to serve in the
interest of our Lord. Therefore, we as representatives of Jesus Christ must
subordinate all personal interest to the function of ambassador. This includes
the consistent intake and application of Bible doctrine and spiritual growth.
Our function of an ambassador becomes more visible to the world as we grow
spiritually and our spiritual gifts become more functional. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An ambassador does not treat any insult as personal. When
you are insulted or treated unfairly, the grace of God provides significant
capabilities to handle such problems. These are opportunities to apply the <i>epignosis</i>
doctrine in your soul to the situation. This is how we grow spiritually and
this is how we better represent Jesus Christ here on earth. God takes care of
His name and Word. We are not here to defend, but to spread the Word of God.
The Holy Spirit takes care of the results.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When an ambassador is recalled, it is because of
degenerating relations between the countries or a war is about to be declar­ed.
When the Church is recalled, hostility begins in the Tribulation. The Church
will be removed from the earth at the Rapture, thus initiating the Tribulation.
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>The function of the believer as
an ambassador is dependent on the production of divine good in the Christian
way of life. The ambassador’s service can be a function of their spiritual gift
or obedience to the Word.  Since maximum production involves spiritual
maturity, it is obvious that the attainment of spiritual maturity results in
maximum effectiveness as an ambassador for Jesus Christ.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>Since the filling of the Spirit
is a requirement for production of divine good, it is also an absolute
necessity in the function of ambassador. Anything thought or said or performed
apart from the filling of the Spirit is human good and therefore unusable in
the functions of an ambassador. Every believer is in full time service. This is
a mandate for the Church Age believer. It is not optional. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The privilege of being an ambassador is the highest
calling for Christ. <span style='color:black'>God’s plan uses His ambassadors
in all aspects of human endeavor. Your purpose is to be the most effective
representative for Jesus Christ using only His grace provisions. Every believer
as ambassadors are the personal representatives of the Lord Jesus Christ. Every
believer is in full-time service in the plan of God. You always represent
Christ.</span> We serve Christ and are rewarded in heaven.</p>
