<h2><a name="_Administration,_Spiritual_Gifts"></a><a
name="_Administrations,_Spiritual_Gift"></a>Administration, Spiritual Gift </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The permanent spiritual gift of administration or administrative
leadership is sometimes called the gift of governments because it has delegated
authority from the pastor-teacher. This gift is given to male believers only.
Rom. 12:8; 1 Cor. 12:28. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;or he who exhorts, in his exhortation; he who gives, with
liberality; he who leads, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with
cheerfulness.&quot;  (Romans 12:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And God has appointed in the church, first apostles,
second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps,
administrations, various kinds of tongues.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 12:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 12:8, “administrations” is the present middle
participle of <span lang=EL>προι</span>̈́́<span lang=EL>στημι</span>
(proistēmi) and means to stand before, to attend to, thus to lead. This is
leadership with diligence which relates to authority while 1 Corinthians 12:28
mentions “administrations” which can also be translated as “governments.”
Therefore, the spiritual gift of administration involves both authority and
leadership in the local church.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This spiritual gift is held by the deacons in the local
church who hold leadership positions such as the chairman and vice chairman of
the deacon board. Some believers may serve as deacons without this gift, but
must possess the gift of service. The spiritual gift of administration is also
held by those who hold positions on missionary boards, leaders of Christian
service organizations, and those who manage training of children in the local
church. The gift of administration is, therefore, linked to the operations of
the local church. Those who serve on committees must have the gift of service. See
category on <a href="#_Service,_Spiritual_Gift">Service, Spiritual Gift.</a></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Pastor-teachers are responsible for identifying men who have
this gift and appointing them to appropriate positions in the local church. The
very existence of this permanent gift emphasizes the fact that the primary
responsibility of the pastor is not administration. One important point should
be understood. A male believer may be good at running some business or
organization, but that ability does not mean he has this spiritual gift. The
gift of administration calls for more than simply effective administrative
function. It is a spiritual gift which is sensitive to the needs of the local
church and how they are best administered.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 Timothy 3:4-5 and 1 Timothy 3:12 use <span lang=EL>προι</span>̈́́<span
lang=EL>στημι</span> (proistēmi) to mean “to manage.” </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He must be one who manages his own household well,
keeping his children under control with all dignity (but if a man does not know
how to manage his own household, how will he take care of the church of
God?),&quot;  (1 Timothy 3:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Deacons must be husbands of only one wife, and good
managers of their children and their own households.&quot;  (1 Timothy 3:12,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 Timothy 5:17 and 1 Thessalonians 5:12 use <span
lang=EL>προι</span>̈́́<span lang=EL>στημι</span> (proistēmi) to mean “to rule”
and “to have charge over you” in reference to pastors teaching Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The elders who rule well are to be considered worthy of
double honor, especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching.&quot; 
(1 Timothy 5:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But we request of you, brethren, that you appreciate
those who diligently labor among you, and have charge over you in the Lord and
give you instruction,&quot;  (1 Thessalonians 5:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Titus 3:8 and Titus 3:14 use <span lang=EL>προι</span>̈́́<span
lang=EL>στημι</span> (proistēmi) to mean “to engage” in maintaining or
administering divine good production. It also has a secular connotation to
profess honest occupations, to make it their business to do good.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;This is a trustworthy statement; and concerning these
things I want you to speak confidently, so that those who have believed God
will be careful to engage in good deeds. These things are good and profitable
for men.&quot;  (Titus 3:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Our people must also learn to engage in good deeds to
meet pressing needs, so that they will not be unfruitful.&quot;  (Titus 3:14,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 1:5, Proverbs 11:14, and Proverbs 24:6, <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>תּחבּלה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(tachbûlâh) in the Hebrew is used and
means wise counsel, advice, and wise guidance respectively. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;A wise man will hear and increase in learning, And a man
of understanding will acquire wise counsel,&quot;  (Proverbs 1:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Where there is no guidance the people fall, But in
abundance of counselors there is victory.&quot;  (Proverbs 11:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For by wise guidance you will wage war, And in abundance
of counselors there is victory.&quot;  (Proverbs 24:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 12:28, <span lang=EL>κυβε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ρνησις</span> (kubernēsis) means administrations and is listed as one
of the spiritual gifts. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And God has appointed in the church, first apostles,
second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps,
administrations, various kinds of tongues.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 12:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 27:11 and Revelation 18:17, a similar word <span
lang=EL>κυβερνη</span>́<span lang=EL>της</span> (kubernētēs) is used as a
pilot and as a shipmaster respectively. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But the centurion was more persuaded by the pilot and the
captain of the ship than by what was being said by Paul.&quot;  (Acts 27:11,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;for in one hour such great wealth has been laid waste!'
And every shipmaster and every passenger and sailor, and as many as make their
living by the sea, stood at a distance,&quot;  (Revelation 18:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Timothy 2:15, the phrase “be diligent” is the verb <span
lang=EL>σπουδα</span>́<span lang=EL>ζω</span> (spoudazō) in the Greek and
means hard work, to exert one’s self, to endeavor, to give diligence. The
believer with this spiritual gift is to perform his ministry with diligence.
The word “accurately” is <span lang=EL>ο</span>̓<span lang=EL>ρθοτομε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (orthotomeō) and means to make straight and smooth, to handle
aright, to teach the truth directly and correctly. This noun involves
perspiration and faithfulness. This is the ability to handle details decently
and in order without getting entangled.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a
workman who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of
truth.&quot;  (2 Timothy 2:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 14:40, “be done” is the present passive
imperative of <span lang=EL>γι</span>́<span lang=EL>νομαι</span> (ginomai) and
means to let things become. The word “properly” is <span lang=EL>ευ</span>̓<span
lang=EL>σχημο</span>́<span lang=EL>νως</span> (euschēmonōs) and means in a
seemly manner, decently, properly. The word “orderly” is <span lang=EL>τα</span>́<span
lang=EL>ξις</span> (taxis) and is in the locative case, locative of sphere in
logical sequence. This would be the metaphorical use of the locative case and
means in a right order, orderly. Therefore, spiritual production logically and
chronologically. This has to do with outward spiritual maturity and refers to
honest conduct. It also denotes the external quality of the Christian life. A
translation from the Greek is; “and let all things, honestly, orderly, and
according to their right order, come to be, or become.”</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But all things must be done properly and in an orderly
manner.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 14:40, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Other meanings of the Greek word <span lang=EL>τα</span>́<span
lang=EL>ξις</span> (taxis) are: an arrangement, a fixed succession in a fixed
time in Luke 1:8, a right order in 1 Corinthians 14:40, an orderly condition,
the post or task a person holds. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now it happened that while he was performing his priestly
service before God in the appointed order of his division,&quot;  (Luke 1:8,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 13:1, “established” is <span lang=EL>τα</span>́<span
lang=EL>σσω</span> (tassō) and means are established or to appoint, or to
arrange, to place in a certain order.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Every person is to be in subjection to the governing
authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist
are established by God.&quot;  (Romans 13:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Other related words of <i>tassō</i> include <span
lang=EL>τα</span>́<span lang=EL>γμα</span> (tagma) in 1 Corinthians 15:23 and
means that which has been arranged, things placed in order, certain bands,
troops, or classifications and <span lang=EL>τακτο</span>́<span lang=EL>ς</span>
(taktos) in Acts 12:21 which means ordered, arranged, fixed.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, after
that those who are Christ's at His coming,&quot;  (1 Corinthians 15:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;On an appointed day Herod, having put on his royal
apparel, took his seat on the rostrum and began delivering an address to
them.&quot;  (Acts 12:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Thessalonians 4:12, “properly” refers to not giving
those outside of the local church a justifiable criticism of their honesty
within. For example, paying of bills, etc. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;so that you will behave properly toward outsiders and not
be in any need.&quot;  (1 Thessalonians 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>These verses above are in the present passive imperative
thus indicating they are commands. Through an exercise of spiritual gifts,
things become honest and in right order, i.e. administration gift. The term
honest or decent relates the ministry of the spiritual gifts to the outward
spiritually mature life. This would include the business life, family life,
etc. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As the things are brought into a “right order” or
perspective, then they become honest and present a better Christian testimony.
The passive voice of the verb means that they must become “orderly.” This
relates to the divine good production in the spiritual life, primarily of
spiritual gifts functioning to bring this to pass.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The spirit of 1 Corinthians 14:40 is indicated in this
spiritual gift. This spiritual gift exemplifies a divine ability to control
details, to handle details in the Angelic Conflict without getting overcome by
them. They are the deacons of Acts 6. This, among other spiritual gifts,
relieves the communicators of Bible doctrine (pastor-teachers and evangelists)
of a multitude of details allowing them to study, pray, and teach. Acts 6:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the
ministry of the word.&quot;&quot;  (Acts 6:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This spiritual gift is needed on a deacon board, in
business, or as a politician in government. 1 Tim. 3, 1 Tim. 6. Your business
is your full time Christian service. The premise is that a businessman is an
administrator, where this spiritual gift enables him to be highly esteemed by
his employees. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Timothy 6:1, the Greek word for “doctrine” is <span
lang=EL>διδασκαλι</span>́<span lang=EL>α</span> (didaskalia) and means
teaching, instruction. The phrase “worthy of all honor” means the mental
attitude of the employer who is a believer generates a good mental attitude in
their employees by keeping the application of Bible doctrine as it relates to
business and in its proper place. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;All who are under the yoke as slaves are to regard their
own masters as worthy of all honor so that the name of God and our doctrine
will not be spoken against.&quot;  (1 Timothy 6:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Administration Outside the Local Church</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual gifts are not limited to so called Christian
service. Your right job is your spiritual service. It is your full time
Christian service. You are to have the proper prospective in your employees and
employer relationships. 1 Tim. 6:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Those who have believers as their masters must not be
disrespectful to them because they are brethren, but must serve them all the
more, because those who partake of the benefit are believers and beloved. Teach
and preach these principles.&quot;  (1 Timothy 6:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Timothy 6:2, “disrespectful” is the present active
imperative of <span lang=EL>καταφρονε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(kataphroneō) and means to think down, to look down your nose, to not respect,
esteem, or recognize their authority. “Serve them” is the present active
imperative of <span lang=EL>δουλευ</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (douleuō) and
means to be a slave, serve, do service, to obey in a good sense, to yield
obedience.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Businesses typically have three general divisions just as
a local congregation is typically structured with the pastor-teacher, deacon
board, and the congregation. Phil. 1:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus, To all
the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, including the overseers and
deacons:&quot;  (Philippians 1:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One owner or chief executive. He is the general. He cuts
through the red tape. He assumes all responsibility. He is the policy maker,
vetoer. He has the highest authority. He pays the bills and wages. He hires and
fires ultimately unless it is quite a large business. He is the enforcer, he
keeps slop out of his business, and takes up the slack. He works hard, expects
his employees to do so, but is a man of grace.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Several executives, officers, and managers/supervisors.
They reflect the position of the chief executive. They get their delegated
authority from the chief. They report and are responsible to the chief. They
are a mediation between the employees and the chief, as they are employees, but
they are more responsible to their boss than to lower level employees. Why? The
employees never call the shots. However, what they think is important. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Pay is usually commensurate with the amount of authority,
responsibility, and ability. Production is rewarded in business. Authority
always gets its character from the higher rather than the lower. The chain of
command is God (and Bible), then chief executive, executives or officers,
managers or supervisors, and rank and file employees. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Danger areas to watch in any organization involve mental
attitude sins of discontent and lack of authority orientation. Levels of
authority and responsibilities must be defined. 1 Tim. 6:3-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If anyone advocates a different doctrine and does not
agree with sound words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ, and with the doctrine
conforming to godliness, he is conceited and understands nothing; but he has a
morbid interest in controversial questions and disputes about words, out of
which arise envy, strife, abusive language, evil suspicions, and constant
friction between men of depraved mind and deprived of the truth, who suppose
that godliness is a means of gain.&quot;  (1 Timothy 6:3-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Timothy 6:4, “disputes about words” is <span
lang=EL>λογομαχι</span>́<span lang=EL>α</span> (logomachia). It is an
interpretation term and means to wrangle about empty and trifling matters. The
word “envy” is <span lang=EL>φθο</span>́<span lang=EL>νος</span> (phthonos) and
means jealousy. This is a mental attitude of displeasure produced by witnessing
or hearing of the advantage or prosperity of others. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Strife” is <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓́<span lang=EL>ρις</span>
(eris) and means an overt manifestation of mental attitude, a language
expression of discontent. The phrase “abusive language” is <span lang=EL>βλασφημι</span>́<span
lang=EL>α</span> (blasphēmia) and means to blast authority, can be directed
against God, but here is undermining the authority of the foremen or chief. The
word “suspicions” is <span lang=EL>υ</span>̔<span lang=EL>πο</span>́<span
lang=EL>νοια</span> (huponoia) and means conjecture, surmising, often a
personal attack on the chief, or foremen. These are evil machinations.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Timothy 6:5, “constant friction” is <span lang=EL>διαπαντο</span>́<span
lang=EL>ς</span> (diapantos) and means a constant, incessant wrangling and
irritation. The word “deprived” is the perfect passive participle of <span
lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>ποστερε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(apostereō) means a pious fraud and refers to one robbed of Bible doctrine
through the corrupt condition of the mind. The word “suppose” is the present
active participle of <span lang=EL>νομι</span>́<span lang=EL>ζω</span>
(nomizō) and means to deem, to think, to suppose. The phrase “means of gain”
is <span lang=EL>πορισμο</span>́<span lang=EL>ς</span> (porismos) and means
making procurement or providing a way of life. His purpose in life is to
provide for his family and he makes 1 Timothy 5:8 a way of life. His job is his
religion. When he loses it, he loses all. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But if anyone does not provide for his own, and
especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse
than an unbeliever.&quot;  (1 Timothy 5:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Timothy 6:6, “godliness” is <span lang=EL>ευ</span>̓<span
lang=EL>σε</span>́<span lang=EL>βεια</span> (eusebeia) and refers to the
filling of Holy Spirit accompanied with contentment. The word “contentment” is <span
lang=EL>αυ</span>̓<span lang=EL>τα</span>́<span lang=EL>ρκεια</span>
(autarkeia) and refers to the perfect environment in the soul.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But godliness actually is a means of great gain when
accompanied by contentment.&quot;  (1 Timothy 6:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Principles of Administration</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All believers administrate in some capacity. All must
administrate even though some don’t have the spiritual gift. Also, all must do
the work of an evangelist even though all do not have the spiritual gift of
evangelism.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Proverbs 25:1-7 contains principles to use when in
success. In Proverbs 25:2, “to conceal a matter” means that God often conceals
a truth until the proper time. It is concealed in the mind then brought out at
the proper time. The phrase “glory of kings” means a sense of responsibility.
The king is an administrator. An administrator must be unbiased, unprejudiced,
fair and impartial in the fulfillment of their responsibility. The word
“matter” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>דּבר</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(dâbâr) and means a
word, a matter, a situation and refers to Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;It is the glory of God to conceal a matter, But the glory
of kings is to search out a matter.&quot;  (Proverbs 25:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An administrator needs a sense of responsibility toward
God. This is spelled out through Bible doctrine. All believers are in full time
Christian service. There is no such thing as dedication to full time Christian
service. As long as you are in this life, you are in full time Christian
service. You are to do everything as unto the Lord, not to just get ahead or
because it’s the thing to do or because of approbation or power lust, it is the
proper motivation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An administrator must not judge on the basis of personal
likes or dislikes. This is describing the mental attitude of anyone in
responsible positions. They must look at life from divine viewpoint. Hezekiah
is in view here, but he failed. He knew religion was wrong. He abolished it,
but there must be doctrine and he didn’t have it. He didn’t get it from Isaiah,
the greatest Bible doctrine man in the ancient world. He began to think human
viewpoint. In pride, he stopped paying taxes to Assyria and went to Egypt for
help. Isaiah 30-31. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An administrator is one in authority who must base his
authority on something higher than himself. He is a human being simply like any
other human being. He may have more determination or perseverance, more
ability, better training, or better planning. Sometimes a general in the army
isn’t any smarter than a sergeant. They must be anchored to a plan greater than
they are. They can’t move their subordinates by saying, “I’d be pleased if
you’d do that.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An administrator must master the details of life by
proper priorities, putting doctrine ahead of detail and by doing the unpleasant
things first in a day. Do not procrastinate. Formulate a plan and then work the
plan. An administration must have dignity and poise. Prov. 25:3. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;As the heavens for height and the earth for depth, So the
heart of kings is unsearchable.&quot;  (Proverbs 25:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Anyone in authority is a human being. No such thing
exists as a superman. Some people put others on a pedestal in their minds. They
think in terms of background, prejudices, pressure, and concept. Some may not
like their mannerisms or the way they part their hair. Anyone in command should
never let on how they feel. The personal feelings of a leader should be just as
obscure, just as unknown as the universe at large. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 25:3, the word “unsearchable” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>חקר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(chêqer) with the negative participle and
means unquestioned. Leaders or administrators in a local church cannot cater to
anyone regardless of who they are. Granted, someone has to keep the place
running. But, a pastor can never cow-tow to any local family or group. He must
have no partiality. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An administrator should never use his authority or high
office to avenge his enemies. This is often done today where a man uses his
office to take care of his personal vendettas. In other words, the mind of a
king must be free from mental attitude sins, envy, spite, and hostility. His
private life must be locked up in his frontal lobe.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A stabilized, mature, administrator leads to a stabilized
nation, church, corporation, etc. In Proverbs 25:4, the phrase “Take away the
dross” is an analogy and means anything that keeps the metal from being pure.
Silver ore cannot be made into a vessel, at least not by ancient methods. For
silver ore to be turned into a silver vessel of any kind, there must be a
refining process to remove impurities. A silversmith will take the purified
metal and mold it into a very beautiful vessel. The metal must be purified
before it is usable.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Take away the dross from the silver, And there comes out
a vessel for the smith;&quot;  (Proverbs 25:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Before the country of Judah could be rescued from their
disaster situation, there had to be a national purification. Isaiah had a
tremendous ministry. Hundreds of thousands of people were saved and began to
learn and apply Bible doctrine. The dross was religion, legalism and apostacy.
Only Bible doctrine in the soul can replace the dross of religion, legalism and
apostacy.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 25:5, “wicked” refers to the current king’s
state department. In Isaiah 36:3, these were the three frightened men worried,
distraught, and in panic mode. Assyria had been undefeated in 2,000 years of
battle. These men are phased out and Isaiah became the advisor at that point.
In a time of crisis, a man of doctrine was needed. As a result, the kingdom of
Israel was delivered from the Assyrians.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Take away the wicked before the king, And his throne will
be established in righteousness.&quot;  (Proverbs 25:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the
household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came
out to him.&quot;  (Isaiah 36:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Be established in righteousness” means to take away
apostacy, false doctrine and human viewpoint. “Established” means to be
stabilized in righteousness by the removal of the false state department in
Isaiah 36:3. There was a maximum number of people with Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An administrator must not be arrogant. In Proverbs
25:6-7, the failures of Hezekiah are in the past and he had confessed his sins
and was stabilized. We are to not to try to put on a false humility before God.
We are to confess our known sins to God the Father and move ahead in the
spiritual life. Dispense with the apologetic manner.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Do not claim honor in the presence of the king, And do
not stand in the place of great men; For it is better that it be said to you,
&quot;Come up here,&quot; Than for you to be placed lower in the presence of
the prince, Whom your eyes have seen.&quot;  (Proverbs 25:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 25:6, this refers to standing in your mental
attitude in a place of greatness. Pride, approbation lust, and power lust are
the mental attitude sins involved here. Hezekiah made Egyptian policy. He
wanted everyone to bow and scrape to him. This verse means to not display
arrogance in the presence of the king and do not stand at a table with the
seats of the greater people. In Proverbs 25:7, the best thing is to take a
lower station and then be asked to come to a higher station rather than to be at
the right hand of the king and be displaced to a lower station. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The administrator must oversee, troubleshoot, and
occasionally “crack the whip” to keep the organization from getting sloppy and
as such must demand respect. They must “keep their cool” through criticism. An
administrator must have the ability to keep the communication lines open and
have the ability to express themselves and to make themselves clear. They must
have the ability to think through a situation and think ahead.</p>
