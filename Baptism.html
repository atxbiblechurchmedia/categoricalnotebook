<h2><a name="_Water_Baptism"></a>Baptism </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Baptism means to identify or to be made one with. It
means something so identified with something else that its nature or character
is changed or it represents a real change that has already taken place.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are two types of baptism – real and ritual. The
real baptism is the actual identification and there are four real baptisms in
Scripture. The ritual baptism is a representative identification and there are
three ritual baptisms in Scripture. In ritual baptisms, the individual is
identified with the water, but the water is symbolic of something else.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The baptism of the believer in the Church Age is the
ritual or picture of the real baptism of the Holy Spirit that takes place at
the point of salvation. Ritual baptism must follow salvation, never precede it.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer needs Bible doctrine before baptism to fully
understand its meaning (i.e., positional truth, retroactive positional truth,
current positional truth, experiential positional truth, human good versus
divine good, etc.). </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer was baptized in the early church very soon
after salvation. Why? Because as soon as the individual was saved, Paul, or any
other believer like Philip who was baptized immediately gave them a long lesson
in Bible doctrine. This might have been six or seven hours of instruction.
Immediately upon understanding the basic Bible doctrines, the individual was
baptized with water.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The candidate for baptism is often a victim rather than a
candidate. Why? They do not understand the doctrine reality behind the ritual.
An individual believer should never be baptized until they understands the
basic Bible doctrine relating to salvation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Etymology of the Word Baptize</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The verb “baptize” and the noun “baptism” are Greek words
that are not translated, they are transliterations where the Greek letters are
given English letters. Baptize is βαπτίζω (baptizō) and is pronounced “baptidzo”
and is the basic root and means to identify with or to make one with, something
so identified with something else that its nature or character is changed.
There are many uses of <i>baptizō</i> in secular Greek sources and always has
the idea of identification.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>But baptism does not save! Water baptism symbolizes the
change that has already taken place by believing in Jesus Christ. We know the
etymology of <i>baptizō</i> because of the use of the word in ancient Greek
literature. Ninth century B.C. Homer’s Odyssey used the word in this way. When
the one-eyed Cyclops was speared by Ulysses, the sound was a hissing noise as
when a blacksmith baptizes a piece of hot metal in the water. The iron was
identified with the water causing it to be tempered.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Spartans used the word baptize in the dipping of a
battle spear point into hog’s blood to identify the spear with battle. Swords
dipped in blood identified the sword with warfare. The sword was baptized and
identified with the blood by immersing it in the blood. The sword came out
bloody. Metal identified with water when tempering it or baptizing the metal.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Euripides used the word for a sunken ship identified with
the bottom of the sea when it sank. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A piece of cloth was said to be baptized in dye and thus,
a change of identity was the result. A pasture was baptized by fire, that is,
its identity was changed from being green to being burned black. The word
baptize has the basic meaning of a change of identity or identification with
someone or something.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Real Baptisms: Actual Identification</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Real baptisms are an actual identification of one thing
with another. Real baptism involves no water at all.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Baptism of Moses</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The children of Israel were identified with Moses and Moses
was identified with the Cloud that represented the Lord Jesus Christ (the Shekinah
Glory) as they passed through the Red Sea in deliverance. Water here speaks of
judgment and the only ones immersed in water on that occasion were the
Egyptians who drowned. 1 Cor. 10:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For I do not want you to be unaware, brethren, that our
fathers were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea; and all were
baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians
10:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Baptism of the Cross or Cup</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Cup represents the Cross and into the cup is poured
out the sins of the world. Jesus Christ “drank” this cup filled with our sins on
the Cross. This speaks of Christ being identified with and judged for our sins
through His substitutionary spiritual death on the Cross with the result that
we receive salvation when we believe in His atoning work on the Cross for our
sins. He was made sin for us. Matt. 20:22; 2 Cor. 5:21; 1 Peter 2:24. See
category on <a href="#_D-Baptism_of_the">Baptism of the Cup</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But Jesus answered, “You do not know what you are asking. Are
you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?” They said to Him, “We are
able.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 20:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that
we might become the righteousness of God in Him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Corinthians
5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, so that
we might die to sin and live to righteousness; for by His wounds you were
healed.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Peter 2:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Baptism of the Holy Spirit</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>No water is involved with this baptism. At the point of
salvation, God the Holy Spirit places each believer into union with the Lord
Jesus Christ who is in session at the right hand of God the Father. Thus, the
believer is placed into the body of Christ and are then positionally higher
than the angels. Only then is the believer identified as a Christian. 2
Corinthians 5:17 is speaking of our position in Christ. The things that are new
are eternal life, His righteousness, inheritance, etc. Overt activity is not in
view in 2 Corinthians 5:17. 1 Cor. 12:13; Acts 1:5; Rom. 6:3-4; Gal. 3; Col.
2:12; Eph. 4:4-6. See category on <a href="#_Baptism_of_the">Baptism of the
Holy Spirit</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creature;
the old things passed away; behold, new things have come.&quot;  (2 Corinthians
5:17, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether
Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one
Spirit.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 12:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with
the Holy Spirit not many days from now.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 1:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into
Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death? Therefore we have been buried
with Him through baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead
through the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
6:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“having been buried with Him in baptism, in which you were also
raised up with Him through faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the
dead.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Colossians 2:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“There is one body and one Spirit, just as also you were called
in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and
Father of all who is over all and through all and in all.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians
4:4-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Baptism of the Holy Spirit did not occur in the Old
Testament. A believer is identified with Jesus Christ in two ways - Retroactive
Positional Truth and Current Positional Truth.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Retroactive Positional Truth is defined as when Christ
died on the cross over 2000 years ago, in position you died with Him, you were
buried with Him, and you rose with Him. This did not become real to you until
you received Him at the point of salvation. At that point in time, His death,
burial and resurrection become retroactive. Even though it happened many years
ago, it became actual when you believed. When Christ died on the Cross, He
judged sin once and for all and rejected human good. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Current Positional Truth is defined as because of
Retroactive Positional Truth, the Church Age believer enjoy certain things and
shares certain things with Jesus Christ. Christ is currently seated at the
right hand of God the Father and believers share this position. He is eternal
life, so you share that eternal life. Jesus Christ is absolute righteousness,
so believers share that righteousness through position and imputation. He is
King, so we shall share this kingship and reign with Him. He is elected, so we
share His election. Jesus Christ is predestined, so we share His destiny. He is
the Son of God, so we become sons of God. He is the heir of God, so we share
this inheritance which makes us joint heirs with Jesus Christ. Everything Jesus
Christ has He shares with us because we are new creatures in Christ Jesus. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Baptism of Fire</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This the baptism of judgment. The unbeliever is
identified with fire for eternity. The Tribulational unbeliever is identified
with the defeat of Satan. The baptism of Fire occurs to all unbelievers alive
on earth at the Second Advent and are removed from the earth prior to the start
of the Millennium. This speaks of unbelievers at the end of the Tribulation
being identified with the fire of judgment. Matt. 25:31-33; Matt. 3:11; Luke
3:16; 2 Thess. 1:7-9; Rev. 19:11, Matt. 24. See category on <a
href="#_D-Baptism_of_Fire">Baptism of Fire</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>““But when the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the
angels with Him, then He will sit on His glorious throne. “All the nations will
be gathered before Him; and He will separate them from one another, as the
shepherd separates the sheep from the goats; and He will put the sheep on His
right, and the goats on the left.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 25:31-33, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““As for me, I baptize you with water for repentance, but He
who is coming after me is mightier than I, and I am not fit to remove His
sandals; He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew
3:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;John answered and said to them all, &quot;As for me, I
baptize you with water; but One is coming who is mightier than I, and I am not
fit to untie the thong of His sandals; He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit
and fire.&quot;  (Luke 3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Ritual Baptisms: Representative Identification </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ritual baptisms are water baptisms where the water
represents something. The individual is identified with the water. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>John the Baptist’s Baptizing Ministry </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Water represents or symbolizes the Kingdom of God which
John preached. After the individual had believed in the coming Messiah – Jesus
Christ, they were baptized with water. Since the water represented the Kingdom
of God and the one baptized identified with water, thus they were identified
with the Kingdom of God. The believers, when baptized by John, were indicating
in effect; “I have previously believed in the Messiah to come, I am now
symbolizing that identification with His kingdom by water baptism.” Luke 3:3; Matt.
3:6; Matt. 3:11. See category on <a href="#_D-John’s_Baptizing_Ministry">John’s
Baptizing Ministry</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and they were being baptized by him in the Jordan River, as
they confessed their sins.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 3:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;As for me, I baptize you with water for repentance,
but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, and I am not fit to remove
His sandals; He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.&quot;  (Matthew
3:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And he came into all the district around the Jordan,
preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins;&quot;  (Luke
3:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Baptism of Jesus Christ</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Water represents the Father’s will for the incarnation of
Jesus Christ. The incarnation is God the Son agreeing to come to the earth and
take on the form of a man - a true human body. This resulted in the unique God-man
in Hypostatic Union forever. It was the Father’s will that Jesus Christ go to
the Cross and bear the sins of the world. By Jesus Christ being emersed into
water by John the Baptist, He was saying He was willing to do the will of God
the Father. Heb. 10:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;THEN I SAID, 'BEHOLD, I HAVE COME (IN THE SCROLL OF
THE BOOK IT IS WRITTEN OF ME) TO DO YOUR WILL, O GOD.'&quot;&quot;  (Hebrews
10:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This was a unique baptism. Jesus Christ was not a sinner.
Water is symbolic of the Father’s will. Jesus Christ identified Himself with
the Father’s will in the execution of salvation. We cannot “follow the Lord in
baptism” as to His purpose (securing our redemption), but we can in duplication
of the mode of His baptism. It is better to never use the phrase. Our Lord was
obedient to the plan and will of God the Father. In baptism, the believer is
obedient to the plan and will of God. Matt. 3:13-17. See category on <a
href="#_D-Jesus_Christ,_Baptism">Jesus Christ, Baptism</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Jesus arrived from Galilee at the Jordan coming to John,
to be baptized by him. But John tried to prevent Him, saying, “I have need to
be baptized by You, and do You come to me?” But Jesus answering said to him, “Permit
it at this time; for in this way it is fitting for us to fulfill all
righteousness.” Then he permitted Him. After being baptized, Jesus came up
immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened, and he saw the
Spirit of God descending as a dove and lighting on Him, and behold, a voice out
of the heavens said, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleased.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew
3:13-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Water Baptism</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Water represents the person of the Lord Jesus Christ.
Believers are identified with Christ in His death, burial, and resurrection. It
symbolizes Retroactive and Current Positional Truth. It is the ritual that
represents the real Baptism of the Holy Spirit that has already taken place at
the point of salvation. Matt. 28:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing
them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew
28:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Since water baptism symbolizes the mechanics of real salvation
that has already occurred, when you go under the water, the water symbolizes
cleansing of sin and also rejection of human good. When you come out of the
water and into the air, it symbolizes acceptance of divine good. Hence, water
baptism illustrates Positional Truth. See category on <a href="#_Water_Baptism">Water
Baptism</a>.</p>
