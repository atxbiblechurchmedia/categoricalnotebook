<h2>The Bible, Origin of the New Testament</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Reproduction of Scriptural Copies</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scriptural copies were created by hand prior to the development
of the printing press in 1454 AD. The scribe (copier) counted every word and
every letter in a Scriptural portion before and after he copied it. If the
number did not agree, the manuscript was destroyed. They used a certain kind of
ink and wrote on special animal skins. Each word was pronounced by the scribe
aloud while he copied. Every time the term “God” appeared he would clean the
quill and dip in fresh ink. Before recording the name of Jehovah, the scribe
would wash his entire body with water. The work was then checked upon
completion and if one incorrect letter was found, the manuscript was destroyed.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Progression of Major Handwritten Copies</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In about 250 BC, more Jews spoke Greek than Hebrew
because of the worldwide influence of the late Alexander the Great. So the
Hebrew Old Testament was translated into the Greek. It was called the
Septuagint. Also in about 250 AD, due to Roman influence an “Old Latin” Bible
was in circulation. From this in 401 AD came the “Latin Vulgate” and from the
Latin Vulgate came the Roman Catholic Douay Version.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>English translations came, for the most part, from the
Greek Septuagint and Greek New Testament. Catholic influence, however,
translated their versions from the Latin Vulgate. The first English attempt was
in 700 AD by Aldhelm, a translation of the Psalms. At the same time, Bede
translated a portion of the Gospel of John. The first complete English
translation occurred in 1380 AD for the New Testament, 1382 AD for the Old
Testament by John Wycliffe. Persecution was severe at this time from many
religious authorities because they did not think that the Scriptures should be
in the hands of the common people! 170 copies exist today.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Progression of Printing Press Copies</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1454 AD, Gutenberg printed a Latin Psalter. In 1456
AD, an entire Latin Vulgate Bible was printed called “The Gutenberg Bible” and was
among the earliest major books printed using mass-produced movable metal type. Forty-nine
copies (or substantial portions of copies) have survived.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>William Tyndale in 1525 AD was the first to print and
publish a complete New Testament in the English language. In five years, 15,000
copies were in print. Tyndale was banished from England and later strangled to
death and then burned at the stake for printing this New Testament. But a year
after he died, the whole Bible was printed and authorized by the King of
England.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1537 AD, an entire Bible was published by John Rogers
and copies were chained to stands to keep them from being destroyed, hence the
Chained Bible. John Rogers was burned at the stake in 1555 by the Queen of
England - Mary Tudor otherwise known as Bloody Mary for her persecution of
Protestants. During her brief reign of 4 1/2 years, 300 Christians were burned
at the stake, hundreds more banished from the country and much blood was shed. The
Bible has also been translated into 1100 other tongues and dialects. For the
past 1,000 years the history of our Bible has been connected with much
bloodshed. </p>
