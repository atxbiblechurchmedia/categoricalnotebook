<h2><a name="_D-Marriage,_Coordination_of"></a>Marriage, Divorce &amp;
Remarriage</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divorce is a difficult doctrine for many believers. It is
also a very difficult subject for unbelievers. The biblical principles
pertaining to this all-to-common and devastating series of events in married
lives are very important. Handling divorce properly and the profound feeling of
rejection that accompanies it is important. Handling it according to God’s plan
through correct application of His Word is the key to maintaining momentum in
your spiritual life! </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The husband, because he is a believer, is mandated to
love his wife as Christ loved the Church.  No unbelieving husband can fulfill
this mandate toward his wife. No unbelieving wife can obey her husband as unto
the Lord. The mandate for wives to obey their husband is part of one of the
four Divine Institutions - Marriage, which applies to unbelievers as well as
believers. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Marriage is. In 1 Corinthians 7:10, a divine mandate is
given that the wife should not leave her husband nor divorce her husband. But
if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband.
And a husband must not divorce his wife. 1 Cor. 7:10-11; 1 Cor. 7:14-15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But to the married I give instructions, not I, but the Lord,
that the wife should not leave her husband (but if she does leave, she must
remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband), and that the husband
should not divorce his wife.” (1 Corinthians 7:10-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the unbelieving husband is sanctified through his wife,
and the unbelieving wife is sanctified through her believing husband; for
otherwise your children are unclean, but now they are holy. Yet if the
unbelieving one leaves, let him leave; the brother or the sister is not under
bondage in such cases, but God has called us to peace.” (1 Corinthians 7:14-15,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The word “divorce” means “freedom to remarry.” Biblical
divorce gives the right of remarriage. Many people think that they should not
be blamed for their weakness or their failures in the matter of marriage.
However, your choice of marriage partner is of your own volition and making
that decision is one of the most important in life. Once married, the success
or failure of marriage depends on many decisions of both husband and wife. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divorce is the severing of both the civil and spiritual
marriage contracts between one man and one woman. However, we will be dealing
with the Scriptural basis for divorce and under what conditions does the Word
of God grant the right of remarriage. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Divorce With the Right of Remarriage in the Church Age
</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When the marital union of two believers or two
unbelievers is broken, there are five principles in Scripture which apply
concerning the right of remarriage. They are salvation of a spouse, adultery,
desertion, victim of a divorce scheme, and physical death.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Salvation</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first principle concerning the right of remarriage is
that all things before salvation are blotted out at the moment of salvation. For
the unbeliever, whatever sins and failures regarding marriage and divorce are
removed at the point of salvation in the Lord Jesus Christ on the Cross. They
could have been married and divorced several times as an unbeliever, but at the
instant of salvation, they become free to remarry. For the unbeliever, every
sin committed during marriage, divorce, and remarriage were all judged on the
Cross by God the Father just like all of the other sins of mankind. If an
unbeliever was living in an adulterous marriage prior to salvation, at the
moment of salvation that marriage becomes instantly purified. Eph. 1:7; Isaiah
43:25; Isaiah 44:22; Col. 1:14; Psalms 103:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness
of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace” (Ephesians 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I, even I, am the one who wipes out your transgressions
for My own sake, And I will not remember your sins.” (Isaiah 43:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I have wiped out your transgressions like a thick cloud
And your sins like a heavy mist. Return to Me, for I have redeemed you.&quot;”
(Isaiah 44:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.”
(Colossians 1:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“As far as the east is from the west, So far has He removed our
transgressions from us.” (Psalms 103:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If an unbeliever has been married and divorced 14 times
before salvation, if at the moment of salvation they are single then they can
marry again. Any number of marriages and divorces are blotted out at the moment
of salvation and they have the freedom and right of remarriage. Psalms 103:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“As far as the east is from the west, So far has He removed our
transgressions from us.” (Psalms 103:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A believer’s life starts at the moment of salvation. No
Christian has a right to penalize other Christians for something which occurred
before salvation, or any other time. No believer should judge another believer
for their sins either prior to salvation nor after salvation. Any divine
discipline that should be administered will only come from the justice of God. Matt.
7:1-2; Heb. 10:30; Rom. 8:33. See category on <a href="#_D-Judging_Others">Judging
Others</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Do not judge so that you will not be judged. &quot;For
in the way you judge, you will be judged; and by your standard of measure, it
will be measured to you.” (Matthew 7:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For we know Him who said, &quot;VENGEANCE IS MINE, I WILL
REPAY.&quot; And again, &quot;THE LORD WILL JUDGE HIS PEOPLE.&quot;” (Hebrews
10:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Who will bring a charge against God's elect? God is the one
who justifies;” (Romans 8:33, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Adultery</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The second principle concerning the right of remarriage
is that divorce because of adultery gives the right of remarriage to the
non-adulterous spouse. The adulterous spouse does not have the right to
remarry. If the adulterous party remarries, that is also adultery and causes
the second husband or wife to be living in adultery. Adultery does not mean
that the marriage must breakup. The innocent spouse may “forgive as Christ
forgave.” Matt. 5:31-32; Matt. 19:9; Mark 10:11-12; Col. 3:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;It was said, 'WHOEVER SENDS HIS WIFE AWAY, LET HIM GIVE
HER A CERTIFICATE OF DIVORCE'; but I say to you that everyone who divorces his
wife, except for the reason of unchastity, makes her commit adultery; and
whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.” (Matthew 5:31-32, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;And I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for
immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery.&quot;” (Matthew 19:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He said to them, &quot;Whoever divorces his wife and
marries another woman commits adultery against her; and if she herself divorces
her husband and marries another man, she is committing adultery.&quot;” (Mark
10:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, whoever
has a complaint against anyone; just as the Lord forgave you, so also should
you.” (Colossians 3:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 16:18, Jesus Christ is defining an adulterous
marriage and the prohibitions involved. He is not saying that divorce is
prohibited. Our Lord is saying that God does not recognize adulterous marriages
even if they are recognized by civil law.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another
commits adultery, and he who marries one who is divorced from a husband commits
adultery.” (Luke 16:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Desertion</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The third principle concerning the right of remarriage is
that divorce because of desertion of the husband or wife gives the right of
remarriage to the other. 1 Cor. 7:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Yet if the unbelieving one leaves, let him leave; the brother
or the sister is not under bondage in such cases, but God has called us to
peace.” (1 Corinthians 7:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Victim of a Divorce Scheme</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fourth principle concerning the right of remarriage
is for the victim of a divorce scheme of deception and/or a victim of your
spouse’s continued implacability or hatred. The guilty party does not have the
right of remarriage. The divorce scheme is any excuse or false pretext to
divorce one spouse for the intended purpose of marrying someone else. In the
dispensation of Israel, the innocent victim of the divorce scheme had the right
of remarriage. In Deuteronomy 24:1-2, “found some indecency in her” was a
scheme used to divorce a woman. An example would be getting her to touch
something unclean, thus making her unclean. Another example would be a husband
who falls in love with another woman, so finds a way to legally divorce his
wife so he can go ahead with the second marriage. This second marriage would be
an adulterous marriage. The innocent wife of the first marriage would have the
right of remarriage.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;When a man takes a wife and marries her, and it happens
that she finds no favor in his eyes because he has found some indecency in her,
and he writes her a certificate of divorce and puts it in her hand and sends
her out from his house, and she leaves his house and goes and becomes another
man's wife,” (Deuteronomy 24:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Physical Death</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fifth principle concerning the right of remarriage is
that if your spouse dies, then the surviving spouse has the right of
remarriage. Death destroys the marriage bond, but it does not destroy the love
in marriage. Love is a mental attitude. Although the surviving spouse is free
to remarry, they should consider taking enough time to be sure they have fully
recovered from the loss of their loved one. This is a time to focus on the
intake of Bible doctrine and to grow spiritually prior to considering remarriage.
They must be sure they have fully recovered from the loss of their previous
spouse. Rom. 7:2-3; 1 Cor. 7:39.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the married woman is bound by law to her husband while he
is living; but if her husband dies, she is released from the law concerning the
husband. So then, if while her husband is living she is joined to another man,
she shall be called an adulteress; but if her husband dies, she is free from
the law, so that she is not an adulteress though she is joined to another man.”
(Romans 7:2-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“A wife is bound as long as her husband lives; but if her
husband is dead, she is free to be married to whom she wishes, only in the
Lord.” (1 Corinthians 7:39, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Whenever there is a bona fide basis for divorce, there is
the right of remarriage. There is no right of divorce because your spouse is
negative to Bible doctrine. When someone divorces for other than a biblical
cause, the remarriage is tantamount to adultery. Matt. 5:31-32.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;It was said, 'WHOEVER SENDS HIS WIFE AWAY, LET HIM GIVE
HER A CERTIFICATE OF DIVORCE'; but I say to you that everyone who divorces his
wife, except for the reason of unchastity, makes her commit adultery; and
whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.” (Matthew 5:31-32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first nine commandments as stated in Exodus deal with
primarily overt activity, but the Lord Jesus Christ makes it plain in the
Sermon on the Mount that sin goes beyond the overt act. Sin exists in the
mental attitude as well. Matt. 5:21-22; Matt. 5:27-28.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You have heard that the ancients were told, 'YOU SHALL
NOT COMMIT MURDER' and 'Whoever commits murder shall be liable to the court.'
&quot;But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be
guilty before the court; and whoever says to his brother, 'You
good-for-nothing,' shall be guilty before the supreme court; and whoever says,
'You fool,' shall be guilty enough to go into the fiery hell.” (Matthew
5:21-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You have heard that it was said, 'YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT
ADULTERY'; but I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust for
her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.” (Matthew 5:27-28,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If you marry against God’s will, that is, as an
unbeliever or a wrongly divorced person, the doctrine of status quo supersedes
the sin part of that problem. Do not break it up! Confess the sin and move on!
Do not look back, but learn Bible doctrine and stay filled with the Holy Spirit
and use the principle of winning that person to the Lord. If a couple decides
they have married the wrong person, they are not to break up their marriage,
but to remain married and emphasize daily intake and application of Bible
doctrine. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Divorce With No Right of Remarriage in the Church Age</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Scripture is silent regarding some obvious and
legitimate reasons for divorce before the law such as physical abuse to spouse
or children, drug abuse, alcoholism, sexual abuse of spouse or children,
homicidal or suicidal tendencies or threats, criminality by a spouse against
the family, and insanity. All of these things are legitimate reasons for
divorce before the law. Anytime the spouse or children are in a life
threatening situation, the innocent spouse has the right of divorce.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Scripture is silent because those who have the right
of divorce in these cases have no right of remarriage. The purpose of divorce
is the protection of life and limb, not the basis of remarriage. If the guilty
party remarries or dies, then the innocent party has the right to remarry. The
guilty party is not permitted to remarry. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The innocent spouse in such cases has undergone a
traumatic experience which requires time to recover and heal. The innocent
spouse should focus on the consistent intake and application of Bible doctrine,
allow the Holy Spirit to renovate their soul, and give themselves time to grow
spiritually. Spiritual growth is the key to recovery from a difficult divorce
and the traumatic events that preceded it. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Grace Principles Regarding Divorce</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As with anything in the spiritual life, God's grace is
the focus. Regarding divorce, God's grace has provided divine solutions to
every difficult situation that a failed marriage and divorce can bring. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For those who have divorced and remarried contrary to the
Scripture, you should remain in the marriage relationship and focus on growing
spiritually. Through confession of sin according to 1 John 1:9, any believer
who finds themselves in an adulterous marriage and confesses that decision as
sin to God the Father is forgiven and cleansed from all unrighteousness. </p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>No matter how many sins and failures have gone into your
marriage, seeking a divorce should not be your first option. You should
continue in the consistent intake and application of Bible doctrine and grow
spiritually. Spiritual growth is the key to success in any marriage, no matter
what has happened earlier. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You should not try to make adjustments for your past
failures in marriage, divorce, and remarriage, but remain in your current
relationship. As you learn Bible doctrine, your current relationship will
become more clear according to God's plan for your life. For any future
decision to be a good decision, it must be based on <i>epignosis</i> Bible
doctrine in the right lobe of your soul. Let divine viewpoint thinking
determine your next steps.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For those self-righteous, arrogant or legalistic types
that just can’t help judging others who have committed adultery or been
divorced, they are opposing God's grace. They will receive divine discipline as
God determines. Matt. 7:1-2; Luke 6:37.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Do not judge so that you will not be judged. &quot;For
in the way you judge, you will be judged; and by your standard of measure, it
will be measured to you.” (Matthew 7:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Do not judge, and you will not be judged; and do not
condemn, and you will not be condemned; pardon, and you will be pardoned.”
(Luke 6:37, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Legalism is self-righteous arrogance. Legalism is looking
down at the adulterer and in their self-righteousness judging them. Such people
feel superior and attempt to step in for God and render condemnation. That is
the opposite of grace orientation. If someone is angry and bitter toward those
who have committed adultery or divorced, then they are judging them. If Jesus
Christ died spiritually on the Cross for all the sins of mankind, then He died
for the sins of adultery. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Divorce in the Old Testament </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Old Testament, the man always divorced the woman.
In the Old Testament, a legal divorce was certified by a legal written document
with the husband’s signature stamped or sealed in the presence of at least two
witnesses. The signed divorce document was then delivered to the wife. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Deuteronomy 24:1, “some indecency” refers to any
reason that displeased the husband as an excuse to divorce and marry someone to
whom he had become attracted. This is called a divorce scheme and includes any
false pretext or hypocrisy that will provide the husband the divorce that he
desires. Deuteronomy 24:1 is not talking about adultery which was a crime
punishable by stoning to death, if convicted. Deut. 22:20-21. The same phrase
is used in Deuteronomy 23:14 and also does not refer to adultery. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;When a man takes a wife and marries her, and it happens
that she finds no favor in his eyes because he has found some indecency in her,
and he writes her a certificate of divorce and puts it in her hand and sends
her out from his house,” (Deuteronomy 24:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But if this charge is true, that the girl was not found
a virgin, then they shall bring out the girl to the doorway of her father's
house, and the men of her city shall stone her to death because she has
committed an act of folly in Israel by playing the harlot in her father's
house; thus you shall purge the evil from among you.” (Deuteronomy 22:20-21,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Since the LORD your God walks in the midst of your camp
to deliver you and to defeat your enemies before you, therefore your camp must
be holy; and He must not see anything indecent among you or He will turn away
from you.” (Deuteronomy 23:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Deuteronomy 24:2, because the wife is the innocent
victim of a divorce scheme, this constitutes a biblical divorce and means the
wife has the right to remarry. Under the Mosaic Law, divorce was abused and
distorted because there were many possible reasons for “some indecency.” In the
Old Testament, a husband who wanted to divorce his wife would get her to touch
some dead animal or the clothes of someone who had died or go to a funeral. He
would then immediately send for a judge and declare his wife unclean. Mal.
2:11-17; Lev. 5, 7, 10, 11, 13; Num. 19; Deut. 23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and she leaves his house and goes and becomes another man's
wife,” (Deuteronomy 24:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Deuteronomy 24:3-4, the exception is that she may not
remarry husband #1 if there was a marriage in between, even if husband #2 dies
or divorces her legitimately. In Deuteronomy 24:3-4, the “latter husband” is
husband #2 and the “former husband” is husband #1. </p>

<p class=Verses>“and if the latter husband turns against her and writes her a
certificate of divorce and puts it in her hand and sends her out of his house,
or if the latter husband dies who took her to be his wife, then her former
husband who sent her away is not allowed to take her again to be his wife,
since she has been defiled; for that is an abomination before the LORD, and you
shall not bring sin on the land which the LORD your God gives you as an
inheritance.” (Deuteronomy 24:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Since she has been defiled” means she was defiled in the
mind of husband #1. She did nothing wrong here. Husband #1 was short-circuited
sexually because she had been with another man. She was not defiled so far as
her second marriage, but with regard to her first husband, she was defiled.
Husband #1 is vulnerable to the mental attitude sins of hatred, jealousy, and
bitterness because of husband #2.  Husband #1 would also be hypersensitive
regarding his sexual ability in comparison to husband #2.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Deuteronomy 24:4, “bring sin on the land” refers to a
maximum number of incompatible marriages in the nation due to either adultery
or divorce schemes. Because marriage is one of the Divine Institutions, it is
important to the stability of family life and stability of a nation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Marriage Between Believer and Unbeliever</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Marriage between a believer and an unbeliever is
prohibited. However, if you are a believer and your spouse is an unbeliever,
this situation is no excuse for dissolving the marriage.  According to 1
Corinthians 7:12, just because you get saved and your spouse remains unsaved is
not biblical grounds for divorce! 2 Cor. 6:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But to the rest I say, not the Lord, that if any brother has a
wife who is an unbeliever, and she consents to live with him, he must not
divorce her.” (1 Corinthians 7:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do not be bound together with unbelievers; for what
partnership have righteousness and lawlessness, or what fellowship has light
with darkness?” (2 Corinthians 6:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 7:13, it states that if a woman who is a
believer has an unbelieving husband and he consents to live with her, she
should not divorce her husband. This is a case for either the husband or the
wife as believers who are married to an unbeliever. Neither believer can use
the unbelief of their spouse as grounds for divorce. This is because the laws
of divine establishment state that marriage is for both believers and
unbelievers alike.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And a woman who has an unbelieving husband, and he consents to
live with her, she must not send her husband away.” (1 Corinthians 7:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 7:14, the unbelieving husband is
sanctified through his believing wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified
through her believing husband. This does not mean they are saved by proxy. It
means that they are under blessing by association as stated by the phrase “for
otherwise your children are unclean, but now they are holy.” </p>

<p class=Verses>“For the unbelieving husband is sanctified through his wife,
and the unbelieving wife is sanctified through her believing husband; for
otherwise your children are unclean, but now they are holy.” (1 Corinthians
7:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If the marriage bond is broken in a marriage between a
believer and an unbeliever, God only allows divorce to be done by the
unbelieving spouse. 1 Cor. 7:15. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Yet if the unbelieving one leaves, let him leave; the brother
or the sister is not under bondage in such cases, but God has called us to
peace.” (1 Corinthians 7:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 7:16-17, a mandate is presented for the
believing spouse to continue in the personal evangelism toward their marriage
partner based on their unconditional love for them. This is no different that
the believer’s mandate to be a witness for Jesus Christ to the unbelieving
world through their ambassadorship as part of their royal priesthood for the
Church Age. Those married to unbelieving spouses should continue to be a
positive example to their spouses and their children of what the Word of God
can do to someone and through someone. They should continue to present the
Gospel and Bible doctrine to their spouses under unconditional love whenever
the opportunity arises. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For how do you know, O wife, whether you will save your
husband? Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save your wife? Only,
as the Lord has assigned to each one, as God has called each, in this manner
let him walk. And so I direct in all the churches.” (1 Corinthians 7:16-17,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>When a Marriage Fails</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When a marriage fails, there are really three options.
The first option is to continue in the marriage for the sake of properly
raising the children or for other reasons. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The second option is separation with no right of
remarriage. There is a difference biblically between the concept of divorce and
that of separation. Civil laws of legal separation often confuse this issue.
Biblical separation is any justified separation, but separation does not give
the right of remarriage, only reconciliation to the marriage partner. Valid
reasons for separation include physical abuse, fear of serious physical harm or
death, or fear of physical abuse of the children. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The third option is divorce with right of remarriage.
This word means “freedom to remarry.” Whenever the Bible gives the right of
divorce, it gives the freedom to remarry, with one exception where a spouse
cannot remarry their first spouse after having married another. Deut. 24:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“then her former husband who sent her away is not allowed to
take her again to be his wife, since she has been defiled; for that is an
abomination before the LORD, and you shall not bring sin on the land which the
LORD your God gives you as an inheritance.” (Deuteronomy 24:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Conclusions</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Word of God says that divorce with the right of
remarriage in the Church Age is based only on adultery, desertion, being the
victim of the divorce scheme, or by a previous spouse remarrying or dying.
Scripture is silent on other legitimate reasons for divorce and does not give
the right of remarriage except if the guilty spouse dies or remarries. The
guilty party of a divorce does not have the right of remarriage. If the guilty
party does marry, they have created an adulterous marriage.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The attitude of many people and religions toward a
divorced couple has been judging, rejection, and ostracism. This is legalism.
God’s grace demands acceptance. We are to pray for them that the divorced
couple would focus on the intake and application of Bible doctrine. We should
pray for their recovery through spiritual growth. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For those who have discovered their spouse has committed
adultery, they don’t have to get a divorce. The innocent spouse may wish to
continue the marriage. Adultery is a sin and once forgiven, no longer remains
an issue. If they choose to remain married, the spiritual solution would be
that they should seek concentrated spiritual growth together through in the
intake and application of Bible doctrine. This is the divine solution. This
spiritual growth can enable the couple to regain their love rapport. 1 Cor.
7:27.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be released. Are you
released from a wife? Do not seek a wife.” (1 Corinthians 7:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For adulterous marriages that follow a divorce where one
of the spouses was the guilty party in a divorce due to adultery, they should
also seek spiritual growth together through the intake and application of Bible
doctrine. This converts the adulterous marriage to a purified and successful
marriage. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Following divorce for any reason, the believer should
focus their time on spiritual growth to allow time to heal and allow the Holy
Spirit to rehabilitate their soul. For those who divorce or separate because of
life-threatening situations, this time of spiritual growth will allow them to
heal the physical and mental trauma in single status.</p>
