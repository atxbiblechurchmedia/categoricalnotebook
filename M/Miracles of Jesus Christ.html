<h2>Miracles of<a name="_Jesus_Christ,_Miracles"></a> Jesus Christ</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ performed acts of healing and miracles to
demonstrate who and what He was – the unique God-man, the Messiah. The miracles
served to establish Jesus Christ’s identity and credentials as “the God who
works wonders” is Psalms 77:14. By performing miracles, He gained a hearing for
this vitally important message. John 10:36-38.</p>

<p class=Verses>“You are the God who works wonders; You have made known Your
strength among the peoples.” (Psalms 77:14, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“do you say of Him, whom the Father sanctified and sent into
the world, 'You are blaspheming,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God'?
&quot;If I do not do the works of My Father, do not believe Me; but if I do
them, though you do not believe Me, believe the works, so that you may know and
understand that the Father is in Me, and I in the Father.&quot;” (John
10:36-38, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>His power over the sea, over death, over sickness, and
over demons was shown to prove who Jesus was and to give Him an audience for
His message. The purpose of miracles was to:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>1 - Establish
credentials of Jesus Christ as the God-Man, the Messiah.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>2 - Provide
signs of His divine nature.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>3 - Prove
that God the Father had sent Him – that He was the Messiah.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>4 - Prove
His power over the physical world.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>5 - Show the
stamp of His character.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>6 - Provide
symbols to observers of His supernatural power.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>7 - Prove
His power over the miseries of the world that were caused by the fall of Adam
in the Garden and for bringing sin into the world.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>8 - Elicit
confidence in Him and trust easily translated to faith in His work for
salvation.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He did not heal just to alleviate suffering, but to call
attention to His message. Otherwise, Jesus would have healed everyone in the
world. His miracles were never done on demand because God does not bend to
man’s will. The important thing was not how you feel in life, but where you
will spend eternity. His greatest miracle was giving salvation to the human
race, if they chose to accept it by faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus gave His disciples authority to perform miracles in
Matthew 10:8. They included “cleanse the lepers” which was different from
healing the sick because it involved the leper reporting into the temple and
going through the purification ceremony which alerted the priesthood to the
fact that the Messiah was there. “Raise the dead” was resuscitation and “cast
out demons” was necessary because demons were active trying to neutralize the
Gospel message.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast
out demons. Freely you received, freely give.” (Matthew 10:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The power to heal and perform miracles was given to the
disciples to indicate that they represented the Messiah. It gave their message
the stamp of divine authority. This was special empowerment of the Holy Spirit
to a select few for special jobs as typical in the dispensation of the Age of
the Jews.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The modus operandi of miracles and healings in the
Pre-Canon period of the Church Age was spiritual gifts. The disciples at this
time were apostles to Israel. On the Day of Pentecost, they received the
spiritual gift of Apostleship and became Apostles to the Church.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>List of Miracles in Chronological Order</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The following is a listing of the miracles performed by
Our Lord during His incarnation. The list is not exhaustive as many miracles
were performed that are not mentioned in the Word of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>1-Turning Water Into Wine - Cana</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A wedding was held in Cana of Galilee and the mother of
Jesus was there. Jesus and His disciples were invited. This miracle showed that
His mother knew her son was the God-man – the Messiah. There were six stone
waterpots holding 20 or 30 gallons each or 120-180 gallons of water
miraculously turned to likely the best wine ever produced. He supernaturally
created wine from water. Even nature cannot do this without sugar, yeast, and
time through fermentation. He instantly changed the chemical structure of the
water to make wine. He showed His complete mastery over nature and chemistry.
The alcoholic content was important to also show His mastery over fermentation.
John 2:1-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and
the mother of Jesus was there; and both Jesus and His disciples were invited to
the wedding.  When the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus said to Him,
&quot;They have no wine.&quot;  And Jesus said to her, &quot;Woman, what does
that have to do with us? My hour has not yet come.&quot;  His mother said to
the servants, &quot;Whatever He says to you, do it.&quot; Now there were six
stone waterpots set there for the Jewish custom of purification, containing
twenty or thirty gallons each. Jesus said to them, &quot;Fill the waterpots
with water.&quot; So they filled them up to the brim.  And He said to them,
&quot;Draw some out now and take it to the headwaiter.&quot; So they took it to
him. When the headwaiter tasted the water which had become wine, and did not
know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the
headwaiter called the bridegroom, and said to him, &quot;Every man serves the
good wine first, and when the people have drunk freely, then he serves the
poorer wine; but you have kept the good wine until now.&quot;  (John 2:1-10
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>2-Healing the Nobleman’s Son - Capernaum</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 4:46-54, Jesus Christ healed the man to show that
He was the Messiah. The man showed humility by asking that Christ heal his son.
The nobleman also showed his faith that Christ could heal. Christ tested that
humility before healing his son. </p>

<p class=Verses>Therefore He came again to Cana of Galilee where He had made
the water wine. And there was a royal official whose son was sick at
Capernaum.  When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he
went to Him and was imploring Him to come down and heal his son; for he was at
the point of death.  So Jesus said to him, &quot;Unless you people see signs
and wonders, you simply will not believe.&quot;  The royal official said to
Him, &quot;Sir, come down before my child dies.&quot;  Jesus said to him,
&quot;Go; your son lives.&quot; The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to
him and started off.  As he was now going down, his slaves met him, saying that
his son was living.  So he inquired of them the hour when he began to get
better. Then they said to him, &quot;Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever
left him.&quot;  So the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus
said to him, &quot;Your son lives&quot;; and he himself believed and his whole
household.  This is again a second sign that Jesus performed when He had come
out of Judea into Galilee.  (John 4:46-54 NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Christ wanted the official to focus on the work of the
Messiah to come and belief that Jesus Christ IS God and the only source of
eternal life. Jesus Christ was only interested in the royal official’s eternal
destiny, not the health of his son. The healing miracle served to bring the
official and his entire household to salvation with eternal repercussions.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The application here is that we are not to put our faith
in miracles, but to use God’s grace resources to grow spiritually and fulfill
His plan for our lives. Eternal salvation and spiritual growth are infinitely
greater than any miracle that remains temporary and moves our focus away from
Jesus Christ to something that yields nothing permanent. The greatest miracle
ever performed was Jesus Christ’s unlimited atonement for sin on the Cross.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>3-First Miraculous Catch of Fish – Sea of Galilee</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ provided an illustration to His disciples to
be, Peter, James and John, of how to trust in His grace provision for their
future ministries to make them fishers of men through the Gospel. They were so
amazed that they left their jobs, their homes and everything and began to
follow their Messiah. They had believed He was God and their Savior. Luke
5:1-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now it happened that while the crowd was pressing around
Him and listening to the word of God, He was standing by the lake of
Gennesaret; and He saw two boats lying at the edge of the lake; but the
fishermen had gotten out of them and were washing their nets. And He got into
one of the boats, which was Simon's, and asked him to put out a little way from
the land. And He sat down and began teaching the people from the boat. When He
had finished speaking, He said to Simon, &quot;Put out into the deep water and
let down your nets for a catch.&quot; Simon answered and said, &quot;Master, we
worked hard all night and caught nothing, but I will do as You say and let down
the nets.&quot; When they had done this, they enclosed a great quantity of
fish, and their nets began to break; so they signaled to their partners in the
other boat for them to come and help them. And they came and filled both of the
boats, so that they began to sink. But when Simon Peter saw that, he fell down
at Jesus' feet, saying, &quot;Go away from me Lord, for I am a sinful
man!&quot; For amazement had seized him and all his companions because of the
catch of fish which they had taken; and so also were James and John, sons of
Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, &quot;Do not
fear, from now on you will be catching men.&quot; When they had brought their
boats to land, they left everything and followed Him.&quot;  (Luke 5:1-11,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>4-Healing the Demoniac in a Synagogue - Capernaum</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mark 1:23-26 and Luke 4:33-36 describe Jesus Christ
casting out a demon in Capernaum.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Just then there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean
spirit; and he cried out, saying, &quot;What business do we have with each
other, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are—the
Holy One of God!&quot; And Jesus rebuked him, saying, &quot;Be quiet, and come
out of him!&quot; Throwing him into convulsions, the unclean spirit cried out
with a loud voice and came out of him.” (Mark 1:23-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>5-Healing Peter’s Mother-in-Law - Capernaum</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Peter’s mother-in-law was in a coma with a high fever.
This was a private miracle. Why? The thoroughness of the miracle from a coma to
vigorous restoration and was a picture of immediate regeneration upon belief in
Jesus Christ. This was the same lesson of spiritual death to spiritual life
instantly as was given to Nicodemus. Matt. 8:14-15; Mark 1:29-30; Luke 4:38-39.</p>

<p class=Verses>When Jesus came into Peter's home, He saw his mother-in-law
lying sick in bed with a fever.  He touched her hand, and the fever left her;
and she got up and waited on Him.  (Matthew 8:14-15 NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And immediately after they came out of the synagogue, they
came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. Now Simon's
mother-in-law was lying sick with a fever; and immediately they spoke to Jesus
about her.” (Mark 1:29-30, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then He got up and left the synagogue, and entered Simon's
home. Now Simon's mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they asked
Him to help her. And standing over her, He rebuked the fever, and it left her;
and she immediately got up and waited on them.” (Luke 4:38-39, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>6-Healing The Many Demon Possessed - Nazareth</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus wanted a maximum number of people in His home town
to know of Him. Healing all who came to Him is a picture of Unlimited
Atonement. Our Lord fulfilled the Isaiah 53:4 prophecy by taking away the
universal affliction of mankind - sin. Matt. 8:16-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>Surely our griefs He Himself bore, And our sorrows He carried;
Yet we ourselves esteemed Him stricken, Smitten of God, and afflicted.  (Isaiah
53:4 NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>When evening came, they brought to Him many who were
demon-possessed; and He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who
were ill.  This was to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet:
&quot;HE HIMSELF TOOK OUR INFIRMITIES AND CARRIED AWAY OUR DISEASES.&quot; 
(Matthew 8:16-17 NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>7-Cleanses the Leper - Galilee</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Jews believed that leprosy was a judgment from God
for uncleanness and separation. The perceived apostasy for the infected people
led to severe separation. This was the worst uncleanness. Just touching a leper
would render you permanently unclean and was a life-threatening act. Matt.
8:2-4; Mark 1:40-45; Luke 5:12-16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And a leper came to Him and bowed down before Him, and said,
&quot;Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.&quot; Jesus stretched
out His hand and touched him, saying, &quot;I am willing; be cleansed.&quot;
And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. And Jesus said to him, &quot;See that
you tell no one; but go, show yourself to the priest and present the offering
that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.&quot;” (Matthew 8:2-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>While He was in one of the cities, behold, there was a man
covered with leprosy; and when he saw Jesus, he fell on his face and implored
Him, saying, &quot;Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.&quot;  And
He stretched out His hand and touched him, saying, &quot;I am willing; be
cleansed.&quot; And immediately the leprosy left him.  And He ordered him to
tell no one, &quot;But go and show yourself to the priest and make an offering
for your cleansing, just as Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.&quot;  But
the news about Him was spreading even farther, and large crowds were gathering
to hear Him and to be healed of their sicknesses.  But Jesus Himself would
often slip away to the wilderness and pray.  (Luke 5:12-16 NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Mosaic Law has detailed procedures for leprosy. When
symptoms appeared, the priest would inspect the person. To make a diagnosis,
they would refer to Leviticus 13 and 14. Details also indicated how to isolate
the leper – torn cloths, disheveled hair as a sign of defilement. They were
forced to live outside the city in unprotected areas. They were required to
yell, “unclean!, unclean!” to anyone that got near them. Separation and
uncleanness ritual purification was a picture of defilement caused by sin.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The priests treated the lepers cruelly. They did not want
to be downwind of a leper. They added to the Old Testament in their legalism
and distorted the Old Testament Scripture. They stoned lepers if they came too
close. They would not perform the ritual purification on them. The priests were
self-righteous in their religious zeal. The priests were spiritual lepers in
their souls and didn’t even know it.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ healed the leper completely and instantly.
The leper asked for a disease cure and called Him Lord indicating he was
already a believer. The purpose of the miracle was to demonstrate the power of
Jesus Christ as the Messiah. Everyone else ran from the leper while our Lord
stayed and touched him which was a life-threatening act.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This was a picture of Jesus Christ’s life to be given to
redeem mankind. Jesus Christ’s actions were the exact opposite of what everyone
else in society did. He superseded the law of sin and disease by redeeming
mankind of sin by His substitutionary spiritual death on the Cross.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The application is that Jesus Christ would pay for all
sin no matter how horrible they were. The work of Christ on the Cross would
heal all instantly that believed. The miracle demonstrated the power of Jesus
Christ as the Messiah. This was a picture of Jesus Christ’s life that would be
given to redeem mankind.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>8-Healing of Paralytic – Capernaum</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Matt 9:1-8; Mark 2:1-12; Luke 5:17-26.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And they brought to Him a paralytic lying on a bed. Seeing
their faith, Jesus said to the paralytic, &quot;Take courage, son; your sins
are forgiven.&quot;” (Matthew 9:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But so that you may know that the Son of Man has
authority on earth to forgive sins&quot;—then He said to the paralytic,
&quot;Get up, pick up your bed and go home.&quot; And he got up and went home.”
(Matthew 9:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>9-Healing the Sick Man at Pool of Bethesda - Jerusalem</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>John 5:2-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“A man was there who had been ill for thirty-eight years. When
Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he had already been a long time in
that condition, He said to him, &quot;Do you wish to get well?&quot; The sick
man answered Him, &quot;Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool when the
water is stirred up, but while I am coming, another steps down before me.&quot;
Jesus said to him, &quot;Get up, pick up your pallet and walk.&quot;” (John
5:5-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>10-Healing of Withered Hand – Galilee</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Matt. 12:9-13; Mark 3:1-5; Luke 6:6-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And a man was there whose hand was withered. And they
questioned Jesus, asking, &quot;Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?&quot;—so
that they might accuse Him.” (Matthew 12:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then He said to the man, &quot;Stretch out your hand!&quot; He
stretched it out, and it was restored to normal, like the other.” (Matthew
12:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>11-Healing the Centurion’s Servant - Capernaum</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This was the first miracle performed by Jesus Christ
in-absentia. The centurion was a Gentile. Our Lord marveled at the centurion’s
faith. He knew that Christ could heal his servant just by His words or thoughts
and did not have to actually touch the servant. This showed Christ’s power to
heal by thought only. Matt.8:5-13; Luke 7:1-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And when Jesus entered Capernaum, a centurion came to Him,
imploring Him, and saying, &quot;Lord, my servant is lying paralyzed at home,
fearfully tormented.&quot; Jesus *said to him, &quot;I will come and heal
him.&quot;” (Matthew 8:5-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now when Jesus heard this, He marveled and said to those who
were following, &quot;Truly I say to you, I have not found such great faith
with anyone in Israel.” (Matthew 8:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses> “And Jesus said to the centurion, &quot;Go; it shall be done
for you as you have believed.&quot; And the servant was healed that very
moment.” (Matthew 8:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>12-Raising the Widow’s Son - Nain</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 7:11-17, Christ’s demonstrated His power over
death. Jesus demonstrated true compassion to those mourning the dead man based
on His love and grace. He wanted to alleviate their suffering because of His
deep sympathy and sorrow for their suffering, an expression of unconditional
love. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Now as He approached the gate of the city, a dead man was
being carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow; and a
sizeable crowd from the city was with her. When the Lord saw her, He felt
compassion for her, and said to her, &quot;Do not weep.&quot; And He came up
and touched the coffin; and the bearers came to a halt. And He said,
&quot;Young man, I say to you, arise!&quot; The dead man sat up and began to
speak. And Jesus gave him back to his mother.” (Luke 7:12-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Grief would turn to joy just as we will receive a
resurrection body at the return of Jesus Christ. The reaction of the mourners
was unexpected. They were awestruck. They thought He was just a prophet. They
did not recognize Him as the Messiah. Jesus had just performed a miracle like
Elijah and Elisha had done in the same location about 900 years earlier. 1
Kings 17:19-22; 2 Kings 4:32-35.</p>

<p class=Verses>He said to her, &quot;Give me your son.&quot; Then he took him
from her bosom and carried him up to the upper room where he was living, and
laid him on his own bed.  He called to the LORD and said, &quot;O LORD my God,
have You also brought calamity to the widow with whom I am staying, by causing
her son to die?&quot;  Then he stretched himself upon the child three times,
and called to the LORD and said, &quot;O LORD my God, I pray You, let this
child's life return to him.&quot;  The LORD heard the voice of Elijah, and the
life of the child returned to him and he revived.  (1 Kings 17:19-22 NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>When Elisha came into the house, behold the lad was dead and
laid on his bed.  So he entered and shut the door behind them both and prayed
to the LORD.  And he went up and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his
mouth and his eyes on his eyes and his hands on his hands, and he stretched
himself on him; and the flesh of the child became warm.  Then he returned and
walked in the house once back and forth, and went up and stretched himself on
him; and the lad sneezed seven times and the lad opened his eyes.  (2 Kings
4:32-35 NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Matt. 12:22-32; Luke 11:14-23</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute was brought
to Jesus, and He healed him, so that the mute man spoke and saw.” (Matthew
12:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He was casting out a demon, and it was mute; when the
demon had gone out, the mute man spoke; and the crowds were amazed.” (Luke
11:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>14-Calms the Storm – Sea of Galilee</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Fear had gripped the disciples due to the storm and they
were in fear of the boat foundering. While fear is a normal human emotion,
cowardice is not. Cowardice is inability to think (apply doctrine from your
soul) in a crisis or emergency situation. The disciples turned their fear into
cowardice. They were thinking of self-preservation and had to wake Christ to
plead with Him to help. They did not believe that Jesus Christ would keep them
from drowning. Matt. 8:18-27; Mark 4:35-41; Luke 8:22-25.</p>

<p class=Verses>And behold, there arose a great storm on the sea, so that the
boat was being covered with the waves; but Jesus Himself was asleep.  And they
came to Him and woke Him, saying, &quot;Save us, Lord; we are perishing!&quot; 
He said to them, &quot;Why are you afraid, you men of little faith?&quot; Then
He got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and it became perfectly calm.  The
men were amazed, and said, &quot;What kind of a man is this, that even the
winds and the sea obey Him?&quot;  (Matthew 8:24-27 NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They would get a lesson in trusting in the power of God
and confidence in His ability to strengthen them via faith and grace provision.
They still didn’t really trust Jesus Christ and His power. They had to learn to
trust Jesus Christ and what He had said to them only a few hours earlier.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>15-Heals the Gadarene Demoniacs - Gadara</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>No one could control the two demon-possessed men who were
very violent. There was no human solution for them. The naked man cut himself
and screamed constantly and had nearly unlimited strength. They were possessed
by multiple demons called Legion. Matt. 8:28-34; Mark 5:1-20; Luke 8:26-39.</p>

<p class=Verses>When He came to the other side into the country of the
Gadarenes, two men who were demon-possessed met Him as they were coming out of
the tombs. They were so extremely violent that no one could pass by that way. 
And they cried out, saying, &quot;What business do we have with each other, Son
of God? Have You come here to torment us before the time?&quot;  Now there was
a herd of many swine feeding at a distance from them.  The demons began to
entreat Him, saying, &quot;If You are going to cast us out, send us into the
herd of swine.&quot;  And He said to them, &quot;Go!&quot; And they came out
and went into the swine, and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the
sea and perished in the waters.  The herdsmen ran away, and went to the city
and reported everything, including what had happened to the demoniacs.  And
behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw Him, they
implored Him to leave their region.  (Matthew 8:28-34 NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The demons recognized who Jesus Christ was and were
deathly afraid of Him. One demon spoke on behalf of the others. Matt. 25:41.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then He will also say to those on His left, 'Depart from
Me, accursed ones, into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil
and his angels; (Matthew 25:41 NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The demons cannot win in a stand-up fight with Jesus
Christ, so they deceive humans hoping to prevent the return of Christ. Mark
5:14-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>Their herdsmen ran away and reported it in the city and in the
country. And the people came to see what it was that had happened.  They came
to Jesus and observed the man who had been demon-possessed sitting down,
clothed and in his right mind, the very man who had had the &quot;legion&quot;;
and they became frightened.  Those who had seen it described to them how it had
happened to the demon-possessed man, and all about the swine.  And they began
to implore Him to leave their region.  (Mark 5:14-17 NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The townspeople were furious that 2,000 pigs had killed
themselves. They saw Jesus Christ as a threat to their businesses. They had
absolutely no interest in Him as the Messiah. This demon-possessed man became a
believer and was a great testimony to salvation by grace to the whole area and
a very convincing witness for Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God assigns you a mission where you will have the
greatest impact – where people know you. Your mission will be suitable to your
talents, location, etc. You must be patient for God’s assignment and be ready
for any opportunity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>16-Healing the Hemorrhaging Woman - Capernaum</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The chronically ill woman was a believer – before she had
met Jesus Christ. She had such faith that she believed that Jesus Christ would
heal her by simply touching His cloak. Do you have the faith in Jesus Christ
that He will take care of you no matter how sick you feel? Matt. 9:20-22; Mark
5:25-34; Luke 8:43-48.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And a woman who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for
twelve years, came up behind Him and touched the fringe of His cloak; for she
was saying to herself, &quot;If I only touch His garment, I will get
well.&quot; But Jesus turning and seeing her said, &quot;Daughter, take
courage; your faith has made you well.&quot; At once the woman was made well.”
(Matthew 9:20-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>A woman who had had a hemorrhage for twelve years, and had
endured much at the hands of many physicians, and had spent all that she had
and was not helped at all, but rather had grown worse-- after hearing about
Jesus, she came up in the crowd behind Him and touched His cloak.  For she
thought, &quot;If I just touch His garments, I will get well.&quot; 
Immediately the flow of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that
she was healed of her affliction.  Immediately Jesus, perceiving in Himself
that the power proceeding from Him had gone forth, turned around in the crowd
and said, &quot;Who touched My garments?&quot;  And His disciples said to Him,
&quot;You see the crowd pressing in on You, and You say, 'Who touched
Me?'&quot;  And He looked around to see the woman who had done this.  But the
woman fearing and trembling, aware of what had happened to her, came and fell
down before Him and told Him the whole truth.  And He said to her,
&quot;Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace and be healed of your
affliction.&quot;  (Mark 5:25-34 NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>17-Raises Synagogue Official’s (Jairus) Daughter -
Capernaum</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jairus had believed in Jesus Christ as Savior before he
met Him. Mourners were skeptics and unbelievers and showed a stark contrast to
those with faith. Jesus Christ stated that physical death was not permanent.
The girl’s soul had left her body so she was physically dead. Mourners
ridiculed the idea of faith in something that was not observable and logical
(known cause and effect). They only believed in what they could see, feel,
touch, smell, or hear – sensory or empirical. Matt. 9:18-26; Mark 5:22-43; Luke
8:41-56.</p>

<p class=Verses>And there came a man named Jairus, and he was an official of
the synagogue; and he fell at Jesus' feet, and began to implore Him to come to
his house; for he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was
dying. But as He went, the crowds were pressing against Him. (Luke 8:41-42
NASB)  </p>

<p class=Verses>While He was still speaking, someone came from the house of the
synagogue official, saying, &quot;Your daughter has died; do not trouble the
Teacher anymore.&quot;  But when Jesus heard this, He answered him, &quot;Do
not be afraid any longer; only believe, and she will be made well.&quot;  When
He came to the house, He did not allow anyone to enter with Him, except Peter
and John and James, and the girl's father and mother.  Now they were all
weeping and lamenting for her; but He said, &quot;Stop weeping, for she has not
died, but is asleep.&quot;  And they began laughing at Him, knowing that she
had died.  He, however, took her by the hand and called, saying, &quot;Child,
arise!&quot;  And her spirit returned, and she got up immediately; and He gave
orders for something to be given her to eat.  Her parents were amazed; but He
instructed them to tell no one what had happened.  (Luke 8:49-56 NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ demonstrated His power over death and the
illnesses of the human body by ordering the girl’s soul to rejoin her body and
completely healing her at the same time. She had been resuscitated just as
Lazarus had been. She would later die as we all do. She was not resurrected.
That will happen at the Rapture or Exit Resurrection when we will receive a
resurrection body like the one Jesus Christ received at His resurrection.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The application is that the power of belief in Jesus
Christ is the issue – not only for salvation, but for deliverance every day.
Unbelief limits what God can do for you and the rate that you can grow
spiritually. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mourners spiritually and physically rejected Jesus
Christ. Thus, leaving only God’s condemnation for their unbelief – not their
sins. Their own decisions limited God’s options – eternity in the Lake of Fire.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>18-Healing of Two Blind Men - Capernaum</u></p>

<p class=Verses>“As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed Him,
crying out, &quot;Have mercy on us, Son of David!&quot; When He entered the
house, the blind men came up to Him, and Jesus said to them, &quot;Do you
believe that I am able to do this?&quot; They said to Him, &quot;Yes,
Lord.&quot; Then He touched their eyes, saying, &quot;It shall be done to you
according to your faith.&quot; And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly
warned them: &quot;See that no one knows about this!&quot; But they went out
and spread the news about Him throughout all that land.” (Matthew 9:27-31,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>19-Healing of Man Unable to Speak - Capernaum</u></p>

<p class=Verses>“As they were going out, a mute, demon-possessed man was
brought to Him. After the demon was cast out, the mute man spoke; and the
crowds were amazed, and were saying, &quot;Nothing like this has ever been seen
in Israel.&quot;” (Matthew 9:32-33, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>20-Feeding 5,000 People – Near Bethsaida</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There was a very large crowd of more than 5,000 people –
mostly Jewish people as this was a Jewish area. Jesus Christ’s motivation was
to show His power as Messiah by providing sustenance where there was no way to
feed so many. This was a big deal because many would be caught out in the
wilderness all night with no food. The people would have had a very long way to
go to get home with no food. Matt. 14:13-21; Mark 6:32-44; Luke 9:10-17; John
6:1-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>When it was evening, the disciples came to Him and said,
&quot;This place is desolate and the hour is already late; so send the crowds
away, that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves.&quot; 
But Jesus said to them, &quot;They do not need to go away; you give them
something to eat!&quot;  They said to Him, &quot;We have here only five loaves
and two fish.&quot;  And He said, &quot;Bring them here to Me.&quot;  Ordering
the people to sit down on the grass, He took the five loaves and the two fish,
and looking up toward heaven, He blessed the food, and breaking the loaves He
gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds, and they
all ate and were satisfied. They picked up what was left over of the broken
pieces, twelve full baskets.  There were about five thousand men who ate,
besides women and children.  (Matthew 14:15-21 NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The disciples had no belief that Jesus Christ was God or
they would have suggested that He do something like He had done at the wedding
with the wine. From five loaves and two fish, He created so much food that
everyone ate all they could. More was left over than they had started with – 12
baskets full. The application is how much do you expect from God? Do you depend
on Him to provide what you need or do you do what you feel like and then cry to
Him when it doesn’t work out?</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>21-Jesus Christ Walks on Water – Sea of Galilee</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord performed this miracle immediately after feeding
the 5,000. Matt. 14:24-33; Mark 6:45-52; John 6:16-21. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Now when evening came, His disciples went down to the sea, and
after getting into a boat, they started to cross the sea to Capernaum. It had
already become dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them. The sea began to be
stirred up because a strong wind was blowing. Then, when they had rowed about
three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near to the
boat; and they were frightened. But He said to them, &quot;It is I; do not be
afraid.&quot; So they were willing to receive Him into the boat, and
immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going.” (John 6:16-21,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ was walking out a long distance to the boat
in the middle of a storm. The disciples’ first reaction was fear. They thought
they were seeing a ghost – not Jesus Christ. Obviously, they did not yet
believe that He was true God – even after so many miracles and teaching.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Peter had the most faith by stepping out onto the sea
from the boat. However, he allowed his senses to betray his faith and cried out
for Jesus Christ to help him from drowning. In application, Jesus Christ helped
Peter as He does us when we need it - even before we cry out for His help. We
are just as thick-headed as the disciples in our own areas of weakness. We need
time to learn and to allow the Holy Spirit to change our thinking from within
our souls.</p>

His feet; and He healed them. So the crowd marveled as they saw the mute

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mar 7:31-37.</p>

<p class=Verses>“They brought to Him one who was deaf and spoke with
difficulty, and they implored Him to lay His hand on him. Jesus took him aside
from the crowd, by himself, and put His fingers into his ears, and after
spitting, He touched his tongue with the saliva; and looking up to heaven with
a deep sigh, He said to him, &quot;Ephphatha!&quot; that is, &quot;Be
opened!&quot; And his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was
removed, and he began speaking plainly.” (Mark 7:32-35, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>25-Feeds 4,000 People - Decapolis</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This crowd was over 4,000 of mostly Gentiles as this was
a Gentile area. The disciples were astounded that Jesus Christ would do this
for Gentiles. They had believed that the Jewish Messiah would be only for Jews
– not for all of mankind. This is a picture of unlimited atonement for all
mankind – not a select group. Matt. 15:29-38; Mark 8:1-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>And Jesus called His disciples to Him, and said, &quot;I feel
compassion for the people, because they have remained with Me now three days
and have nothing to eat; and I do not want to send them away hungry, for they
might faint on the way.&quot;  The disciples said to Him, &quot;Where would we
get so many loaves in this desolate place to satisfy such a large crowd?&quot; 
And Jesus said to them, &quot;How many loaves do you have?&quot; And they said,
&quot;Seven, and a few small fish.&quot;  And He directed the people to sit
down on the ground; and He took the seven loaves and the fish; and giving
thanks, He broke them and started giving them to the disciples, and the
disciples gave them to the people.  And they all ate and were satisfied, and
they picked up what was left over of the broken pieces, seven large baskets
full.  And those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children. 
And sending away the crowds, Jesus got into the boat and came to the region of

and said, &quot;I see men, for I see them like trees, walking around.&quot;
Then again He laid His hands on his eyes; and he looked intently and was

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>31-Resuscitates Lazarus - Bethany</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Lazarus was the brother of Mary and Martha of Bethany who
were good friends of Jesus Christ.  Our Lord had stayed at their house with His
disciples many times before. A messenger had been sent to have our Lord hurry
to Bethany so He could heal him and prevent his death. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ purposely waited a few days before beginning
the two-day journey to Bethany. This meant that He purposely did not try to
heal Lazarus, but waited for him to die so He could perform the most profound
miracle of His ministry – to show His power over death. This was to prove to
all that He was God. He also used the situation to teach everyone to have faith
in Him and to teach them about resurrection for all believers in Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He resuscitated Lazarus who had been dead for 4 days and
who was already in a state of decay. This miracle so excited the wrath of the
religious Jewish leaders that they held a council soon thereafter and decided
to kill Him to preserve their power in Israel and to prevent others from
believing in Him. John 11:1-44. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Jesus said, &quot;Remove the stone.&quot; Martha, the sister
of the deceased, said to Him, &quot;Lord, by this time there will be a stench,
for he has been dead four days.&quot; Jesus said to her, &quot;Did I not say to
you that if you believe, you will see the glory of God?&quot; So they removed
the stone. Then Jesus raised His eyes, and said, &quot;Father, I thank You that
You have heard Me. &quot;I knew that You always hear Me; but because of the
people standing around I said it, so that they may believe that You sent
Me.&quot; When He had said these things, He cried out with a loud voice,
&quot;Lazarus, come forth.&quot; The man who had died came forth, bound hand
and foot with wrappings, and his face was wrapped around with a cloth. Jesus

crowd sternly told them to be quiet, but they cried out all the more,
&quot;Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!&quot; And Jesus stopped and called
them, and said, &quot;What do you want Me to do for you?&quot; They *said to
Him, &quot;Lord, we want our eyes to be opened.&quot; Moved with compassion,
Jesus touched their eyes; and immediately they regained their sight and

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Application Summary</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Miracles are not what you should pray for in difficult
times. Miracles do not advance you in the spiritual life. Reliance on God’s
grace resources makes life’s circumstances irrelevant. For example, Paul and
the thorn in his flesh. 2 Cor. 12:7-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>Because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, for
this reason, to keep me from exalting myself, there was given me a thorn in the
flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me--to keep me from exalting myself! 
Concerning this I implored the Lord three times that it might leave me.  And He
has said to me, &quot;My grace is sufficient for you, for power is perfected in
weakness.&quot; Most gladly, therefore, I will rather boast about my
weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me.  (2 Corinthians 12:7-9
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A miracle was not in Paul’s best interest – reliance on
the grace of God was. 1 Peter 5:10; Phil. 4:11-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>After you have suffered for a little while, the God of all
grace, who called you to His eternal glory in Christ, will Himself perfect,
confirm, strengthen and establish you.  (1 Peter 5:10 NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>Not that I speak from want, for I have learned to be content in
whatever circumstances I am.  I know how to get along with humble means, and I
also know how to live in prosperity; in any and every circumstance I have
learned the secret of being filled and going hungry, both of having abundance
and suffering need.  I can do all things through Him who strengthens me. 
(Philippians 4:11-13 NASB)</p>
