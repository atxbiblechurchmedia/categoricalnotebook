<h2>Mental Attitude, Divine Viewpoint</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Thinking divine viewpoint is not a warmed over version of
the power of positive thinking. This is a biblical technique for believers
only. It has to do with fellowship with Jesus Christ based on the enabling
power of the Holy Spirit. It is looking unto Jesus the author and perfecter of
our faith. Heb. 12:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith,
who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has
sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.” (Hebrews 12:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers are what they think. This opens the whole realm
of mental attitudes. Prov. 23:7.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“For as he thinks within himself, so he is. He says to you,
&quot;Eat and drink!&quot; But his heart is not with you.” (Proverbs 23:7,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A believer’s success in the spiritual life depends upon
what he or she thinks. Often you equate a tough person with a profane
vocabulary or someone with a strong physical stature. But toughness is a mental
attitude. You are not beaten until you give up mentally. This has been
illustrated by soldiers in many of our wars. Some of them had given up. They had
no desire to live and were soon killed in action. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are two ways of thinking - divine viewpoint or
human viewpoint. Isaiah 55:7-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Let the wicked forsake his way And the unrighteous man his
thoughts; And let him return to the LORD, And He will have compassion on him,
And to our God, For He will abundantly pardon. “For My thoughts are not your
thoughts, Nor are your ways My ways,” declares the LORD. “For as the heavens
are higher than the earth, So are My ways higher than your ways And My thoughts
than your thoughts.”  (Isaiah 55:7-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer today needs mental attitude divine
viewpoint. The believer can’t get it without Bible study. Bible study today is
being poo-pooed. The Christian public has stopped studying. It is interesting
that when believers habitually attend Bible class and church services where the
Word is faithfully taught, they learn to concentrate, to think, and to
stabilize.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To illustrate, when an individual accepts Christ as
Savior, how much divine viewpoint do they have? Just <i>gnosis</i> mixed with a
“mustard seed” of faith. That is a mustard seed of divine viewpoint. The mature
believer has displaced human viewpoint thinking with consistent intake and
application of Bible doctrine through the grace apparatus for perception that
produces divine viewpoint thinking. Thus the mind is renewed. Rom. 12:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by
the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that
which is good and acceptable and perfect.” (Romans 12:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The principle is that you need divine viewpoint to please
God. Human viewpoint never pleases God, no matter how cultured or intelligent
the thinking might be. The unbeliever has human viewpoint and thinks that the
more they work, the more God will be pleased with them. The believer knows that
they are saved by grace and they keep walking after salvation in a
non-meritorious system called faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The only source of divine viewpoint is the Bible. 1 Corinthians
2:16 tells us that the Bible is the mind of Christ. Therefore, we must know the
Word to know His mind and apply it to realize His will. Religion does not agree
with the this statement. Christianity is not a religion, but a personal
relationship with Jesus Christ based purely on God’s grace provision.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT
HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.” (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Bible is a critic or judge of the thoughts and intentions
of the spiritual life. Our thinking must jibe with His thinking. We cannot have
peace in our soul without it. Heb. 4:12. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any
two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of
both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the
heart.” (Hebrews 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Divine Viewpoint Characteristics</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The result of the relaxed mental attitude in the
spiritual life in like-mindedness among believers. One mind is thinking divine
viewpoint. In 1 Peter 3:8, there are four characteristics of like-mindedness,
being of one mind, or being “harmonious.” In every one of these four
characteristics, you have one basic ingredient - thinking.</p>

<p class=Verses>“To sum up, all of you be harmonious, sympathetic, brotherly,
kindhearted, and humble in spirit;”  (1 Peter 3:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first characteristic is to be sympathetic. In 1 Peter
3:8, “sympathetic” is <span lang=EL>συμπαθη</span>́<span lang=EL>ς</span>
(sumpathēs) and means to suffer with someone, to be sympathetic, to have
compassion, to communicate divine viewpoint in time of suffering. We get our
English word sympathy from this Greek word. One believer thinks Bible doctrine
from their frame of reference in a pressure situation. However, another
believer under the same pressure short-circuits. The believer with doctrinal
thinking communicates doctrine to the short-circuited believer by which they
are helped to orient to suffering and to return to fellowship. This connects
with “one mind” because the believer with Bible doctrine is thinking for the
other believer because at this point they are unable to think. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The second characteristic is to have brotherly love for other
believers. In 1 Peter 3:8, “brotherly” is <span lang=EL>φιλα</span>́<span
lang=EL>δελφος</span> (philadelphos) and is a rapport love toward other
believers. The basis of their rapport is not personality or compatibility of
old sin natures, but each thinking divine viewpoint. The Greek word <i>philadelphos</i>
is made up of two words - <i>phileo</i> which is rapport love and <i>aldelphos</i>
which means brother. This rapport love is one of the levels of the edification
complex of the soul. When this rapport is based on <i>epignosis</i> knowledge
and in its application, there is compatibility between two or more believers. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The third characteristic is to be kindhearted or tender
hearted. In 1 Peter 3:8, “kindhearted” is <span lang=EL>ευ</span>̓́<span
lang=EL>σπλαγχνος</span> (eusplagchnos) and means good emotions, good emotional
stability, emotions which fulfill their proper function, enjoying the details
of life influenced by the mentality of the soul. Success in the spiritual life
is thinking doctrine versus just emotion. Failure is emotion over the mind -
not thinking doctrine. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fourth characteristic is to be humble in spirit. In 1
Peter 3:8, “Humble in spirit” is <span lang=EL>ταπεινο</span>́<span lang=EL>φρων</span>
(tapeinophrōn) and means humble minded, oriented to God's grace through Bible
doctrine. This is the mental attitude of grace. Grace thinking leads to grace
action. This is a believer who has good manners, which comes from thinking
divine viewpoint. Humble in spirit means to think free from pride. This is
being gracious and being oriented to grace. We are to treat people in grace.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In all four characteristics, the believer who has “one
mind” thinks Bible doctrine. This one mind is the stability factor. The
believer is thinking doctrine, but not necessarily the same doctrine as another
believer is thinking at the same time. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Grace Orientation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Peter 3:9, grace orientation is illustrated. “Not returning”
is the present active participle of <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>ποδι</span>́<span
lang=EL>δωμι</span> (apodidōmi) and means do not retaliate lip to lip, blow to
blow. “Evil for evil” is verbal railing of mental attitude sins. It means that two
wrongs do not make a right. When someone wrongs you, you should not get out of
fellowship to get back at them. It is wrong to retaliate. When someone wrongs
you, you are never justified in retaliating. Never!</p>

<p class=Verses>“not returning evil for evil or insult for insult, but giving a
blessing instead; for you were called for the very purpose that you might
inherit a blessing.” (1 Peter 3:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You do not build your happiness on someone else’s
unhappiness or misery. You are in double trouble if you try. Think twice before
you gossip. First, if you are out of fellowship use 1 John 1:9. Then put it in
the Lord’s hands. 1 Peter 5:7. </p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“casting all your anxiety on Him, because He cares for you.” (1
Peter 5:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Remember Romans 12:19, “vengeance is mine,” so you keep
it in the Lord’s hands. You forget it, move on, think grace. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Never take your own revenge, beloved, but leave room for the
wrath of God, for it is written, &quot;VENGEANCE IS MINE, I WILL REPAY,&quot;
says the Lord.” (Romans 12:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some of you have experienced people who have torn you to
bits and then wanted you to help them out in some way. Go ahead and help them
out. In 1 Peter 3:9, “but giving a blessing instead” means that your attitude
toward this person should never depend upon their attitude toward you. Your
attitude must always depend on grace. This is unconditional mental attitude <i>agapao</i>
love in action.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Peter 3:9, “giving a blessing” is <span lang=EL>ευ</span>̓<span
lang=EL>λογε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (eulogeō) and means good doctrine,
good word. “For you were called for the very purpose” is the aorist passive
indicative of καλέω (kaleō) and refers to the reality of God’s plan for your
life. ‘‘That you might inherit” is the aorist active subjunctive of  <span
lang=EL>κληρονομε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (klēronomeō) and means to
obtain something specific by an inheritance. The believer must do something to
obtain benefits from their inheritance. Today, the woods are full of born-again
believers, but they are not getting anything specific. They have no substance
from their spiritual inheritance and are walking in rags. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Blessing” is divine blessing based on divine character
not on human character or ability. God will bless you on the basis of who and
what He is, not who and what we are. Therefore, blessing precludes human merit
or human good as the basis of blessing. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Blessing from God is not based on getting with the
program, hustling around and doing nice things, or because you look pious or
gave up bubblegum. Blessing depends upon the character of God and that includes
His love. When we understand His character through knowledge of doctrine and
orientation to grace, we then develop a rapport love. We share in the blessings
of His grace so His character rolls off and hits us. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If we are to orient to grace we must have the right
mental attitude of divine viewpoint and a relaxed mental attitude that comes
from the filling of the Holy Spirit. 2 Cor. 10:4-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but
divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses. We are destroying
speculations and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God, and
we are taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ,” (2 Corinthians
10:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is a trap and a hindrance in mental attitude sins.
Mental attitude sins not only produce self-induced misery but they deprive the
believer of the blessings of grace. Blessing from God cannot be earned or
deserved, it can only be obtained in the inheritance package. The inheritance
or appropriation of blessing in the spiritual life depends on knowledge of Bible
doctrine. We then orient to grace which comes from spiritual growth and the
erection of the edification complex in the right lobe of the soul. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Correct Mental Attitude</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The correct mental attitude in the Christian life is
having divine viewpoint, which gives the believer victory, peace, power and
stability. It will also erects an edification structure in the soul. Phil. 2:5;
2 Tim. 1:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ
Jesus,” (Philippians 2:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of power
and love and discipline.” (2 Timothy 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All changes come from the inside the soul. The Holy
Spirit is the powerhouse in the Christian life and the power and control is
released through the filling of the Holy Spirit. A believer can experience
perfect inner peace even in the midst of difficulties and suffering. Peace is
what you think. Phil. 4:7; Isaiah 26:3. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, will
guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.” (Philippians 4:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;The steadfast of mind You will keep in perfect peace,
Because he trusts in You.” (Isaiah 26:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divine viewpoint brings stability. People get discouraged
because they are thinking human viewpoint. Flipping back and forth between
human viewpoint and divine viewpoint makes a for an unstable Christian.
Unstable Christians need cleansing and renewing of their minds. They need scar
tissue removed by a crash program of taking in Bible doctrine through the grace
apparatus for perception. James 1:8; 1 John 1:9; James 4:8; Eph. 4:23. </p>

<p class=Verses>“being a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.” (James
1:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your
hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded.” (James 4:8,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind,”
(Ephesians 4:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Stability of mind and character is a mental attitude. Isaiah
26:3-4; Phil. 4:7; 2 Thess. 2:9. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;The steadfast of mind You will keep in perfect peace,
Because he trusts in You. &quot;Trust in the LORD forever, For in GOD the LORD,
we have an everlasting Rock.” (Isaiah 26:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, will
guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.” (Philippians 4:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“that is, the one whose coming is in accord with the activity
of Satan, with all power and signs and false wonders,” (2 Thessalonians 2:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Victory in the Christian life is obtained thru the
filling of the Holy Spirit, not while under the control of the old sin nature.
The most important mental attitude of one believer toward another is that of
grace. Rom. 8:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and those who are in the flesh cannot please God.” (Romans
8:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Love is a mental attitude. Deut. 6:5; Deut. 11:13. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and
with all your soul and with all your might.” (Deuteronomy 6:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;It shall come about, if you listen obediently to my
commandments which I am commanding you today, to love the LORD your God and to
serve Him with all your heart and all your soul,” (Deuteronomy 11:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Worldliness is also a mental attitude. Rom. 12:2; Col.
3:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by
the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that
which is good and acceptable and perfect.” (Romans 12:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Set your mind on the things above, not on the things that are
on earth.” (Colossians 3:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mental attitude divine viewpoint, when developed,
produces confidence based on the absolutes of the Word of God. 2 Cor. 5:1; 2
Cor. 5:6; 2 Cor. 5:8. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For we know that if the earthly tent which is our house is
torn down, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in
the heavens.” (2 Corinthians 5:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, being always of good courage, and knowing that
while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord—” (2 Corinthians
5:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“we are of good courage, I say, and prefer rather to be absent
from the body and to be at home with the Lord.” (2 Corinthians 5:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Christian life produces a new mental attitude of
divine viewpoint thinking – thinking with the mind of Christ. The minds of all
believers are capable of looking at life from divine viewpoint. This new mental
attitude requires Bible doctrine in the soul for development. 2 Tim. 1:7; 1
Cor. 2:16. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of power
and love and discipline.”  (2 Timothy 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT
HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.” (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has designed the Christian way of life so that you
can think properly with divine viewpoint. Pressure situations require the
application of <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine from the frame of reference in
the right lobe of the soul. Thinking requires vocabulary. Human vocabulary is
not capable of operation under spiritual pressure. Divine vocabulary is
capable. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The controlling of what you think is based on study under
the daily function of the grace apparatus for perception, which will produce a
large spiritual vocabulary. The vocabulary of the sin of adultery, for example,
is very limited. The vocabulary of true love between husband and wife in
marriage is very developed and large. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Another example is a teenager with Bible doctrine, when
under pressure from a wave of libido, is able to think doctrine because they
have vocabulary (doctrine) stored in the right lobe of the soul in their frame
of reference. They realize that there is a right kind of opposite number for them
and they want no scars of promiscuity to ruin it. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The learning of Bible doctrine followed by application to
the situations we face in life enables the thought system to stabilize. When
this is done daily, it erects an edification structure in your soul. This
structure is built upon believed Bible doctrine which is resident in the right
lobe of the soul. This <i>epignosis</i> knowledge is usable full knowledge. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual knowledge understood is called <span lang=EL>γνώσις</span>
(gnosis). When this spiritual knowledge in believed, the Holy Spirit converts
it into full knowledge called <span lang=EL>επίγνωσις</span> (epignosis). <i>Epignosis</i>
or full knowledge is the material that is used to erect the edification complex
of the soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Divine Viewpoint Illustration</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Lord is my protector and provider. Have you been
reading the headlines lately, the restlessness of nations? There are economic
problems everywhere resulting in inflating currencies. There are a growing number
of aggressive nations trying to dominate their neighboring nations. The world
remains as unstable as is has in the past. Psalms 23:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“A Psalm of David. The LORD is my shepherd, I shall not want.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms
23:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Lord is my inner peace. Through His Word, “green
pastures” become reality by feeding upon His Word. The believer leads by
applying His Word to experience. Psalms 23:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He makes me lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside
quiet waters.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 23:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Lord is my provision for fellowship which restores or
renovates the soul by intake and application of Bible doctrine. “He restores my
soul” refers to restoration to fellowship. He guides you to the production of
divine good through the filling of the Holy Spirit. Psalms 23:3; 1 John 1:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He restores my soul; He guides me in the paths of
righteousness For His name’s sake.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 23:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
John 1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Lord is my comfort or encouragement. God comforts the
believer in dying grace. He protects us continuously from our enemies consistent
with His plan for us. This is protection from dangers just as the shepherd uses
his staff to pull a sheep out from some bushes. Psalms 23:4; Job 5:19-27.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
I fear no evil, for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms
23:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““From six troubles He will deliver you, Even in seven evil
will not touch you. “In famine He will redeem you from death, And in war from
the power of the sword. “You will be hidden from the scourge of the tongue, And
you will not be afraid of violence when it comes. “You will laugh at violence
and famine, And you will not be afraid of wild beasts. “For you will be in
league with the stones of the field, And the beasts of the field will be at
peace with you. “You will know that your tent is secure, For you will visit
your abode and fear no loss. “You will know also that your descendants will be
many, And your offspring as the grass of the earth. “You will come to the grave
in full vigor, Like the stacking of grain in its season. “Behold this; we have
investigated it, and so it is. Hear it, and know for yourself.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Job
5:19-27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Lord is my victory over my enemies. The world around us
is mainly a battle for control of the mind. The flesh is mainly a battle for
control of the body. The devil is mainly a battle to promote religion and human
good over God’s grace and divine good production. Anointing the head with oil refers
to the power to survive with a relaxed mental attitude and the ability to
refresh others. Do you refresh others as a believer or are you a pain in the
neck? Psalms 23:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies;
You have anointed my head with oil; My cup overflows.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 23:5,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Lord’s home will be my home in eternity future.
Goodness is divine good production and lovingkindness refers to mental attitude
grace in action. Psalms 23:6.</p>

<p class=Verses> “Surely goodness and lovingkindness will follow me all the
days of my life, And I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms
23:6, NASB)</p>
