<h2><a name="_Monasticism"></a>Money</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Money Problems </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Human viewpoint says that money brings happiness. This is
an illusion. True happiness starts with salvation and is produced by the filling
of the Holy Spirit from spiritual growth with “joy” as the result. 1 John 1:4;
Gal. 5:22. </p>

<p class=Verses>“These things we write, so that our joy may be made complete.”
(1 John 1:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience,
kindness, goodness, faithfulness,” (Galatians 5:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Human viewpoint also says that money brings security.
This is another illusion. The only security is the believer’s position in
Christ. Every believer has eternal security at the moment of salvation and
enjoys that relationship and Bible doctrine through fellowship with God. God
who did the big thing in saving us and does much more in grace now that we are
saved. Rom. 5. Note in Luke 21:1-4 that Christ was the widow’s living, not the
two coins. The principle is explained in Matthew 6:24-33. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And He looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the
treasury. And He saw a poor widow putting in two small copper coins. And He
said, &quot;Truly I say to you, this poor widow put in more than all of them;
for they all out of their surplus put into the offering; but she out of her
poverty put in all that she had to live on.&quot;” (Luke 21:1-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate
the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the other.
You cannot serve God and wealth.” (Matthew 6:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Do not worry then, saying, 'What will we eat?' or 'What
will we drink?' or 'What will we wear for clothing?' &quot;For the Gentiles
eagerly seek all these things; for your heavenly Father knows that you need all
these things. &quot;But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all
these things will be added to you.” (Matthew 6:31-33, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If you don’t need money, then should you throw it away?
No. Money is a bona fide medium of exchange. It isn’t wrong to spend it either.
However, in the United States, money has become a god to many people. Matt.
6:24; Luke 16:9. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate
the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the other.
You cannot serve God and wealth.” (Matthew 6:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Dangers of money </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To the unbeliever, salvation has been paid for. It cannot
be purchased with money. 1 Peter 1:18-19; Mark 8:36-37. </p>

<p class=Verses>“knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable things like
silver or gold from your futile way of life inherited from your forefathers,
but with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and spotless, the blood of
Christ.” (1 Peter 1:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world,
and forfeit his soul? &quot;For what will a man give in exchange for his soul?”
(Mark 8:36-37, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Money causes the rich to put their faith in the wrong
thing. Mark 10:23-25. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And Jesus, looking around, said to His disciples, &quot;How
hard it will be for those who are wealthy to enter the kingdom of God!&quot;
The disciples were amazed at His words. But Jesus answered again and said to
them, &quot;Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God! &quot;It is
easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to
enter the kingdom of God.&quot;” (Mark 10:23-25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is possible, but difficult for the rich to be saved.
Judas stole money given to the disciples so they were broke all the time. The “eye”
of the needle in Mark 10:23-25 was a very small door in the city gate used
after sundown to let people in one at a time. Money keeps the rich unbeliever
from seeking salvation in the right manner - by means of God’s Word. Luke
16:19-21. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Now there was a rich man, and he habitually dressed in
purple and fine linen, joyously living in splendor every day. &quot;And a poor
man named Lazarus was laid at his gate, covered with sores, and longing to be
fed with the crumbs which were falling from the rich man's table; besides, even
the dogs were coming and licking his sores.” (Luke 16:19-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Money has no credit with God at the Last Judgment, only God's
very own absolute righteousness imputed to every believer at salvation. Prov.
11:4; Prov. 11:28. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Riches do not profit in the day of wrath, But righteousness
delivers from death.” (Proverbs 11:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He who trusts in his riches will fall, But the righteous will
flourish like the green leaf.” (Proverbs 11:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The imputed absolute righteousness (+R) of God delivers the
believer from the second death. Jesus Christ is to be the believer’s focus, not
materialistic things. Heb. 13:5-6; Phil. 4:11. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Make sure that your character is free from the love of money,
being content with what you have; for He Himself has said, &quot;I WILL NEVER
DESERT YOU, NOR WILL I EVER FORSAKE YOU,&quot; so that we confidently say,
&quot;THE LORD IS MY HELPER, I WILL NOT BE AFRAID. WHAT WILL MAN DO TO
ME?&quot;” (Hebrews 13:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Not that I speak from want, for I have learned to be content
in whatever circumstances I am.” (Philippians 4:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To the believer, money can keep a believer from honoring
Christ in the spiritual life, the very purpose for which they remain alive on
earth. Eccl. 5:10-20; Eccl. 6:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor he
who loves abundance with its income. This too is vanity.” (Ecclesiastes 5:10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Here is what I have seen to be good and fitting: to eat, to
drink and enjoy oneself in all one's labor in which he toils under the sun
during the few years of his life which God has given him; for this is his
reward. Furthermore, as for every man to whom God has given riches and wealth,
He has also empowered him to eat from them and to receive his reward and
rejoice in his labor; this is the gift of God.” (Ecclesiastes 5:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For he will not often consider the years of his life, because
God keeps him occupied with the gladness of his heart.” (Ecclesiastes 5:20,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“a man to whom God has given riches and wealth and honor so
that his soul lacks nothing of all that he desires; yet God has not empowered
him to eat from them, for a foreigner enjoys them. This is vanity and a severe
affliction.” (Ecclesiastes 6:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Solomon was a rich king. The weight of one year’s worth
of gold was 666 talents which today is equal to about $1.3 billion dollars. When
a believer is out of fellowship, money is no substitute. God gave wealth, but
Solomon had ulcers and couldn’t enjoy his possessions. 2 Chron. 9:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now the weight of gold which came to Solomon in one year was
666 talents of gold,” (2 Chronicles 9:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Money can be a source of temptation. Contentment is to
have the basic needs of life and all spiritual riches. 1 Tim. 6:7-19. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But godliness actually is a means of great gain when
accompanied by contentment. For we have brought nothing into the world, so we
cannot take anything out of it either.” (1 Timothy 6:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a
snare and many foolish and harmful desires which plunge men into ruin and
destruction. For the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil, and some by
longing for it have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with
many griefs.” (1 Timothy 6:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Instruct those who are rich in this present world not to be
conceited or to fix their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who
richly supplies us with all things to enjoy.” (1 Timothy 6:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The passionate desire for money is the root of all
categories or types of evil. It brings sorrow and misery. The believer is to
follow after fellowship, faith, and experiential righteousness. The rich need
to be taught and exhorted not to be proud and trust in riches, but in the
living God who gives grace in all things to enjoy. Joy is to have spiritual
riches, but not especially all basic needs, as Lazarus was an example. Luke
16:20. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;And a poor man named Lazarus was laid at his gate,
covered with sores,” (Luke 16:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers should spend their money wisely. 1 Tim. 6:8. </p>

<p class=Verses>“If we have food and covering, with these we shall be content.”
(1 Timothy 6:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Investigate carefully before you give. Don’t give to
groups loaded with false doctrine. Give money for the glory of the Lord.
Believers do not give into the storehouse treasury. The local church needs
money, but you don’t give it through the local church only. Mal. 3:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, so that there
may be food in My house, and test Me now in this,&quot; says the LORD of hosts,
&quot;if I will not open for you the windows of heaven and pour out for you a
blessing until it overflows.” (Malachi 3:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Other passages dealing with the believer and their money
are James 4:13, James 5:6 and Acts 5:1-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Come now, you who say, &quot;Today or tomorrow we will go to
such and such a city, and spend a year there and engage in business and make a
profit.&quot;” (James 4:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“You have condemned and put to death the righteous man; he does
not resist you.” (James 5:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But a man named Ananias, with his wife Sapphira, sold a piece
of property, and kept back some of the price for himself, with his wife's full
knowledge, and bringing a portion of it, he laid it at the apostles' feet.”
(Acts 5:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But Peter said, &quot;Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart
to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back some of the price of the land?”
(Acts 5:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And as he heard these words, Ananias fell down and breathed
his last; and great fear came over all who heard of it.” (Acts 5:5, NASB)</p>
