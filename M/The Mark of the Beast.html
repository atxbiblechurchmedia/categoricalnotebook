<h2><a name="_The_Mark_of"></a><a name="_D-The_Mark_of"></a>The Mark of the
Beast</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Mark of the Beast will be some sort of identification
used in the Tribulation to control the economy by fixing prices, distributing
food supplies, and manipulating the laws of supply and demand by computers or
other means. The word “mark” is <span lang=EL>χα</span>́<span lang=EL>ραγμα</span>
(charagma) and is the Greek word for the Latin word describing a Roman recruit
passing basic training.  During the Roman Empire, the mark was an enlistment
serial number burned on the arm of the Roman soldier. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Tribulation, the Mark of the Beast will identify
you as a member of the Ecumenical Religious System of the Tribulation. The Mark
will be necessary throughout any area where the Roman Empire’s Ecumenical
Religion is accepted - the 10 nation confederation in the Tribulation. There
will be three ways in which one can qualify under this system – one who has the
Mark, the name of the Beast, or the number of the beast - 666. This mark will
be an ID card possibly carrying a symbol concept in computer language which
enslaves individuals. This Mark will be necessary for anyone to conduct social
or business activity for survival such as buying food, engaging in business, or
being socially accepted. It sets up a monopoly for religion. Rev. 13:16-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And he causes all, the small and the great, and the rich and
the poor, and the free men and the slaves, to be given a mark on their right
hand or on their forehead, and he provides that no one will be able to buy or
to sell, except the one who has the mark, either the name of the beast or the
number of his name. Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the
number of the beast, for the number is that of a man; and his number is six
hundred and sixty-six.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation 13:16-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The “name of the beast” refers to a special type of
identification carried by the clergy or priesthood of Satan. This will be
Satan’s version of the VIP concept. He can never seem to get away from this.
The “number of his name” refers to some type of unique identification. This
will be a numbering language, a computer system for the rank and file, a method
of controlling food production and who gets what. Under Satan’s system, you
must deserve what you get. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The number 666 is based on six being the number of man,
three being the number of God, and three sixes simply indicating man trying to
be deified. Anyone agreeing to receive the Mark of the Beast will have made
their choice and it will be irrevocable with God - the same as physical death. Rev.
13:8; Rev. 14:9-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“All who dwell on the earth will worship him, everyone whose
name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life
of the Lamb who has been slain.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation 13:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then another angel, a third one, followed them, saying with a
loud voice, &quot;If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives a
mark on his forehead or on his hand, he also will drink of the wine of the
wrath of God, which is mixed in full strength in the cup of His anger; and he
will be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels
and in the presence of the Lamb. &quot;And the smoke of their torment goes up
forever and ever; they have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast
and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.&quot;” (Revelation
14:9-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Religion will control the state. Religion will control
buying food. Religion will control business activity. Religion will control
social life. Those who do not possess this mark will be ostracized, starved, tortured,
imprisoned and finally executed. To receive this mark, one must worship the
statue of the First Beast or the Dictator of the Revived Roman Empire located
in the temple in Jerusalem. This statue will be called the Abomination of
Desolation. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/A/Abomination%20of%20Desolation.html">Abomination of
Desolation</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Gentile believers in the Tribulation will be martyred
because of their unwillingness to accept the Mark of the Beast. Those with the
Mark of the Beast will be punished by God in the Tribulation. Rev. 15:2; Rev.
16:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire,
and those who had been victorious over the beast and his image and the number
of his name, standing on the sea of glass, holding harps of God.&quot; 
(Revelation 15:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So the first angel went and poured out his bowl on the
earth; and it became a loathsome and malignant sore on the people who had the
mark of the beast and who worshiped his image.&quot;  (Revelation 16:2, NASB)<a
