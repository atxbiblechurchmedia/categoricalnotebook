<h2>Mary, Mother of Jesus </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Her Virtues</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mary had a respect for the Word of God. She had capacity
to worship Him in Spirit and in Truth. Luke 1:38; Luke 1:46.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And Mary said, &quot;Behold, the bondslave of the Lord;
may it be done to me according to your word.&quot; And the angel departed from
her.&quot;  (Luke 1:38, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And Mary said: &quot;My soul exalts the Lord,” (Luke 1:46,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>She understood the grace of God. She understood the
essence of God. Luke 1:48; Luke 1:49-52.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For He has had regard for the humble state of His
bondslave; For behold, from this time on all generations will count me blessed.
&quot;For the Mighty One has done great things for me; And holy is His name.
&quot;AND HIS MERCY IS UPON GENERATION AFTER GENERATION TOWARD THOSE WHO FEAR
HIM. &quot;He has done mighty deeds with His arm; He has scattered those who
were proud in the thoughts of their heart. &quot;He has brought down rulers
from their thrones, And has exalted those who were humble.” (Luke 1:48-52,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>She understood the depravity of man. She had the ability
to think Bible doctrine. Why? She respected authority and enjoyed its fruits.
Luke 1:53; Luke 2:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;HE HAS FILLED THE HUNGRY WITH GOOD THINGS; And sent away
the rich empty-handed.” (Luke 1:53, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But Mary treasured all these things, pondering them in her
heart.” (Luke 2:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Her Understanding and Application of Bible doctrine</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>She knew Scripture and therefore knew Him. Luke 1:46; 1
Sam. 2:1; Psalms 34:2-3. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And Mary said: &quot;My soul exalts the Lord,” (Luke 1:46,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Hannah prayed and said, &quot;My heart exults in the
LORD; My horn is exalted in the LORD, My mouth speaks boldly against my
enemies, Because I rejoice in Your salvation.” (1 Samuel 2:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“My soul will make its boast in the LORD; The humble will hear
it and rejoice. O magnify the LORD with me, And let us exalt His name
together.” (Psalms 34:2-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>She knew who her Son really was. Luke 1:49; Psalms 111:9.
</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For the Mighty One has done great things for me; And
holy is His name.” (Luke 1:49, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He has sent redemption to His people; He has ordained His
covenant forever; Holy and awesome is His name.” (Psalms 111:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>She knew of His mercy. He understood the Abrahamic, Palestinian,
Davidic, and New Covenants. Luke 1:50; Gen. 17:7; Exodus 20:5-6; Psalms 107:13.
</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;AND HIS MERCY IS UPON GENERATION AFTER GENERATION TOWARD
THOSE WHO FEAR HIM.” (Luke 1:50, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your
descendants after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant,
to be God to you and to your descendants after you.” (Genesis 17:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You shall not worship them or serve them; for I, the
LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the
children, on the third and the fourth generations of those who hate Me, but
showing lovingkindness to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My
commandments.” (Exodus 20:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble; He saved
them out of their distresses.” (Psalms 107:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>She knew He was the unique Son of God who had taken on
the form of her son in one person. She knew that His deity had spoken to
Abraham and others in Old Testament times. Luke 1:55; Gen. 17:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“As He spoke to our fathers, To Abraham and his descendants
forever.&quot;” (Luke 1:55, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“God said further to Abraham, &quot;Now as for you, you shall
keep My covenant, you and your descendants after you throughout their
generations.” (Genesis 17:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>She was born-again. Luke 1:47.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior.” (Luke 1:47,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>She understood grace. She had not earned or deserved to
be the human channel for the Messiah. She was able to apply the Word to her
experience. Luke 1:48-49.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For He has had regard for the humble state of His
bondslave; For behold, from this time on all generations will count me blessed.
&quot;For the Mighty One has done great things for me; And holy is His name.”
(Luke 1:48-49, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>She understood His essence and His ability to supply
every need. Luke 1:49-53. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For the Mighty One has done great things for me; And
holy is His name. &quot;AND HIS MERCY IS UPON GENERATION AFTER GENERATION
TOWARD THOSE WHO FEAR HIM. &quot;He has done mighty deeds with His arm; He has
scattered those who were proud in the thoughts of their heart. &quot;He has
brought down rulers from their thrones, And has exalted those who were humble.
&quot;HE HAS FILLED THE HUNGRY WITH GOOD THINGS; And sent away the rich
empty-handed.” (Luke 1:49-53, NASB)</p>
