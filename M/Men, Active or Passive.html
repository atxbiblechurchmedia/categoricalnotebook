<h2>Men, Active or Passive</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Active Man - Characteristics </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The active man often has leadership ability. Peter was
the spokesman for the disciples and had natural leadership abilities. John
6:66-69.</p>

<p class=Verses>“As a result of this many of His disciples withdrew and were
not walking with Him anymore. So Jesus said to the twelve, &quot;You do not
want to go away also, do you?&quot; Simon Peter answered Him, &quot;Lord, to
whom shall we go? You have words of eternal life. &quot;We have believed and
have come to know that You are the Holy One of God.&quot;” (John 6:66-69, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In four lists of the disciples, Peter is always mentioned
first. Mark 3:16-19; Luke 6:14-16; Matt. 10:2-4; Acts 1:13-14. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And He appointed the twelve: Simon (to whom He gave the name
Peter), and James, the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James (to them
He gave the name Boanerges, which means, &quot;Sons of Thunder&quot;); and
Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son
of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot; and Judas Iscariot, who
betrayed Him.” (Mark 3:16-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Peter was chosen first, but he was naturally aggressive.
He worked with his hands and was sports oriented. Peter needed a challenge to
keep going. John 21:3. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Simon Peter said to them, &quot;I am going fishing.&quot; They
said to him, &quot;We will also come with you.&quot; They went out and got into
the boat; and that night they caught nothing.” (John 21:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The active man can be aggressive and may appear to be
more protective than others. Peter jumped into the sea as he could not wait for
the boat to get there. John 21:7. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter,
&quot;It is the Lord.&quot; So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he
put his outer garment on (for he was stripped for work), and threw himself into
the sea.” (John 21:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Peter operated with short bursts is the ear episode and
the denial episodes. John 18:10; John 18:24-27. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Simon Peter then, having a sword, drew it and struck the high
priest's slave, and cut off his right ear; and the slave's name was Malchus.”
(John 18:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So Annas sent Him bound to Caiaphas the high priest. Now Simon
Peter was standing and warming himself. So they said to him, &quot;You are not
also one of His disciples, are you?&quot; He denied it, and said, &quot;I am
not.&quot; One of the slaves of the high priest, being a relative of the one
whose ear Peter cut off, said, &quot;Did I not see you in the garden with
Him?&quot; Peter then denied it again, and immediately a rooster crowed.” (John
18:24-27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When time is on this hands, the active man may be rash,
irritable, and hard to live with. Matt. 17:4. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Peter said to Jesus, &quot;Lord, it is good for us to be here;
if You wish, I will make three tabernacles here, one for You, and one for
Moses, and one for Elijah.&quot;” (Matthew 17:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The active man will tend to have a superiority complex,
rather than an inferiority complex.  Luke 22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But he said to Him, &quot;Lord, with You I am ready to go both
to prison and to death!&quot;” (Luke 22:33, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Active Man - Occupational Hazards</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Peter was the optimistic example of the active man. One
of the occupational hazards of the active man is to promise more than they can
perform. Luke 22:33. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But he said to Him, &quot;Lord, with You I am ready to go both
to prison and to death!&quot;” (Luke 22:33, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The active man may talk far too much and be considered a motor
mouth as was Peter when he denied our Lord for the first time. Luke 22:54-65. </p>

<p class=Verses>“After they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard
and had sat down together, Peter was sitting among them. And a servant-girl,
seeing him as he sat in the firelight and looking intently at him, said,
&quot;This man was with Him too.&quot; But he denied it, saying, &quot;Woman, I
do not know Him.&quot;” (Luke 22:55-57, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The active man may act impulsively or in irrational ways.
Luke 22:49-50.</p>

<p class=Verses>“When those who were around Him saw what was going to happen,
they said, &quot;Lord, shall we strike with the sword?&quot; And one of them
struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his right ear.” (Luke 22:49-50,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The active man always seems to have a solution, but not
always the right one. John 21:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Simon Peter said to them, &quot;I am going fishing.&quot; They
said to him, &quot;We will also come with you.&quot; They went out and got into
the boat; and that night they caught nothing.” (John 21:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When the active man has time on his hands, he gets busy. He
may produce lots of activity, wind and noise, but little production. He can be
temperamental. During the Transfiguration of our Lord, Peter first thought was
that it would be great to build three monuments without really thinking first. Luke
9:27-36.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And as these were leaving Him, Peter said to Jesus,
&quot;Master, it is good for us to be here; let us make three tabernacles: one
for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah&quot;—not realizing what he was
saying.” (Luke 9:33, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It’s hard for the active man to just relax and learn
Bible doctrine. For Peter, rather than just listening to instructions, he had
to learn things the hard way. Peter had to learn many times through divine
discipline. Luke 22.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Like Peter, the active man may have a very critical
nature. He often finds it very difficult to respect authority. The active man
may be fickle and can be impatient. John 13:1-11; John 21:7. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter,
&quot;It is the Lord.&quot; So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he
put his outer garment on (for he was stripped for work), and threw himself into
the sea.” (John 21:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Peter was prone to falling asleep when being taught Bible
doctrine by our Lord. Matt. 26:40; Matt. 26:43; Matt. 26:45.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and said
to Peter, &quot;So, you men could not keep watch with Me for one hour?”
(Matthew 26:40, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Again He came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were
heavy.” (Matthew 26:43, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then He came to the disciples and said to them, &quot;Are you
still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand and the Son of Man is
being betrayed into the hands of sinners.” (Matthew 26:45, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The active man may be impetuous as was Peter when he saw
our Lord walking on the water. Matt. 14:22-36. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Peter said to Him, &quot;Lord, if it is You, command me to
come to You on the water.&quot; And He said, &quot;Come!&quot; And Peter got
out of the boat, and walked on the water and came toward Jesus. But seeing the
wind, he became frightened, and beginning to sink, he cried out, &quot;Lord,
save me!&quot; Immediately Jesus stretched out His hand and took hold of him,
and said to him, &quot;You of little faith, why did you doubt?&quot;” (Matthew
14:28-31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Passive Man - Characteristics</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The passive man often does not desire to be a leader and
may have to be exhorted to be stronger. 2 Tim. 2:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“You therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in
Christ Jesus.” (2 Timothy 2:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The passive man can be the indoor type who fits a suit
better than work clothes, likes spectator sports, and would rather not get his
hands dirty. The passive man may not outwardly appear as the masculine type,
but Bible doctrine brings out the man in him. The passive man may not like to
swear, hates to say damn, etc. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The passive man is, by definition, the non-aggressive
type. When a matter needs correcting, he would rather forget about it or have
someone else deal with it. 2 Tim. 2:3. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Suffer hardship with me, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.”
(2 Timothy 2:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The passive man tends to operate consistently, is content
to work at one job all his life, live in the same area all of his life, stay
married to the same wife regardless of the difficulties, is not restless, is a
homebody. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The passive man tends to not require a challenge to keep
going in that his goals may not be high enough. The passive man may not be
disciplined, but does respond to messages on discipline. The passive man
doesn’t mind having time on the hands and will read, watch TV, or putter around
in a hobby. He doesn’t try to keep up with the Joneses. He may develop an
inferiority complex because he feels he never seems to measure up. 2 Tim. 2:5;
2 Tim. 2:7. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Also if anyone competes as an athlete, he does not win the
prize unless he competes according to the rules.” (2 Timothy 2:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Consider what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding
in everything.” (2 Timothy 2:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Bible doctrine does not change the personality. It just
builds iron into the soul and gives them the functioning edification complex of
the soul and divine good production in the spiritual life!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Passive Man - Occupational Hazards</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Timothy is the pessimistic guilt complex example here. Timothy
was hesitant in promising because didn’t want to break a promise. 1 Tim. 1:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“This command I entrust to you, Timothy, my son, in accordance
with the prophecies previously made concerning you, that by them you fight the
good fight,” (1 Timothy 1:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Like Timothy, the passive man may talk too little and be
the quiet thoughtful type. Timothy would let a situation drag on without being resolved
rather than cause a disturbance and exercise his authority to resolve it. 1 Tim.
4:14. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Do not neglect the spiritual gift within you, which was
bestowed on you through prophetic utterance with the laying on of hands by the
presbytery.” (1 Timothy 4:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The passive man is quite consistent, appears on the
surface to not be ruffled, but is prone to generating ulcers from the stress.
Timothy let his feelings remain bottled up to create stress. 1 Tim. 5:23. </p>

<p class=Verses>“No longer drink water exclusively, but use a little wine for
the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments.” (1 Timothy 5:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The passive man, like Timothy may appear sickly and
always worried about some part of their anatomy not being right. He may think
things through, but be afraid to act on solutions overtly. 1 Tim. 4:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Let no one look down on your youthfulness, but rather in
speech, conduct, love, faith and purity, show yourself an example of those who
believe.” (1 Timothy 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Timothy’s indecision lead to procrastination. 1 Tim.
4:16. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Pay close attention to yourself and to your teaching;
persevere in these things, for as you do this you will ensure salvation both
for yourself and for those who hear you.” (1 Timothy 4:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The passive man often learns the easy way and is a
studious type. He is content to be at home and study. However, it is hard for
this type to meet the public or to be a salesman. 2 Tim. 2:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman
who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth.” (2
Timothy 2:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The passive man often has a live and let live nature, is
not critical per se, and is more relaxed. The passive man may be prone to being
lazy or not doing his share of work. He respects authority and tends to be a
follower rather than a leader. Timothy’s relationship to Paul is an example. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The passive man is often devoted to wife, children, and relatives.
He tends to love family reunions, but says little. This may make him naive. The
passive man is often patient and loves his privacy. However, he does not often take
a stand on issues. 1 Tim. 6:17. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Instruct those who are rich in this present world not to be
conceited or to fix their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who
richly supplies us with all things to enjoy.” (1 Timothy 6:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The passive man is often loyal and tends to tell the
truth when asked. 2 Tim. 4:16. </p>

<p class=Verses>“At my first defense no one supported me, but all deserted me;
may it not be counted against them.” (2 Timothy 4:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The passive man tends to stay awake when Bible doctrine
is taught. He may not properly take his authority leadership home as he should.
His wife may often wear the pants in the family because of his indecisiveness. </p>
