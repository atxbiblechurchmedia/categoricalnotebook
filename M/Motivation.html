<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>True motivation originates from inside the believer from
the filling of the Holy Spirit and the Word of God in the right lobe of the
soul with a frame of reference and an edification complex of the soul. Gal.
5:22-23; 2 Cor. 5:14; Eph. 3:16-20; Eph. 6:6; 1 Peter 1:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience,
kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things
there is no law.” (Galatians 5:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the love of Christ controls us, having concluded this,
that one died for all, therefore all died;” (2 Corinthians 5:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory,
to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inner man, so that
Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; and that you, being rooted and
grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the
breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ which
surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God. Now
to Him who is able to do far more abundantly beyond all that we ask or think,
according to the power that works within us,” (Ephesians 3:16-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“not by way of eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but as slaves of
Christ, doing the will of God from the heart.” (Ephesians 6:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Since you have in obedience to the truth purified your souls
for a sincere love of the brethren, fervently love one another from the heart,”
(1 Peter 1:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 5:14, “controls” is <span lang=EL>συνε</span>́<span
lang=EL>χω</span><span lang=EL> </span>(sunechō) and means to hold together
with constraint, to hold completely. This is a motivation word. <i>Epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine in the soul brings glory to the Lord. However, the Christian can
be motivated by the old sin nature. Spiritual motivation is destroyed by the
dominance of the old sin nature. Phil. 1:15-17. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Some, to be sure, are preaching Christ even from envy and
strife, but some also from good will; the latter do it out of love, knowing
that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel; the former proclaim Christ
out of selfish ambition rather than from pure motives, thinking to cause me
distress in my imprisonment.” (Philippians 1:15-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer can be motivated by human good and by mental
attitude sins of envy and strife. Human good is the best the believer can do in
the Christian life while out of fellowship. The Word of God is to motivate the
believer in the spiritual life to fulfill the plan of God for their life by
executing certain spiritual functions. These include witnessing, praying,
giving, praising the Lord, and teaching or preaching. Phil. 1:15-17; Psalms
109:7; Psalms 66:18; Matt. 7:21-23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Some, to be sure, are preaching Christ even from envy and
strife, but some also from good will; the latter do it out of love, knowing
that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel; the former proclaim Christ
out of selfish ambition rather than from pure motives, thinking to cause me
distress in my imprisonment.” (Philippians 1:15-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“When he is judged, let him come forth guilty, And let his
prayer become sin.” (Psalms 109:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“If I regard wickedness in my heart, The Lord will not hear;”
(Psalms 66:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Not everyone who says to Me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter
the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father who is in heaven
will enter. &quot;Many will say to Me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not
prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name
perform many miracles?' &quot;And then I will declare to them, 'I never knew
you; DEPART FROM ME, YOU WHO PRACTICE LAWLESSNESS.'” (Matthew 7:21-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For motivation to be pure, it must come from staying in
fellowship, functioning daily under the grace apparatus for perception,
applying Bible doctrine to life, spiritual maturity, and resultant stability. 1
Tim. 1:5; 2 Tim. 2:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the goal of our instruction is love from a pure heart and
a good conscience and a sincere faith.” (1 Timothy 1:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now flee from youthful lusts and pursue righteousness, faith,
love and peace, with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.” (2 Timothy
2:22, NASB)</p>
