<h2>The Book of Malachi</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The two messages of Malachi are relating the believer to
the plan of God and for the nation, what causes it to rise, what causes it to
fall, and how this relates to the Word of God. In interpretation, this refers
to Israel and Edom. In application this can refer to the United States of
America. The timeline of the content of the Book of Malachi is during the time
period of Nehemiah. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Historical Background of the Book of Malachi </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 586 BC, the Jews went out under the fifth cycle of
discipline. In 516 BC, the second temple was completed and the fifth cycle of
discipline was over. From 516 to 323 BC, there was fantastic prosperity from
learning Bible doctrine except for one period of apostacy, 420-400 BC. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is the period of time for Malachi, a decline of positive
volition to Bible doctrine. The nation was about to be destroyed and Malachi’s
use of the Word of God saved the nation. About 420-400 BC, the Jews turn their
back on doctrine and the priesthood was made up of unbelievers during this era.
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In crises, the prophets communicated the verbal Word. The
priests communicated the written Word. During this time, the priesthood was apostate
and very similar to the National Council of Churches today. Malachi came onto
the scene after 100 years of prosperity. Suddenly a generation appeared that was
negative. They had a priesthood that was not functioning because they were
unsaved and therefore, had nothing spiritual to feed the people. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Because of this apostacy which intruded into this
prosperity period, Nehemiah in 445 BC received permission from the King of
Persia to go to Jerusalem to get things reorganized. This is known from the Book
of Nehemiah. Nehemiah set up “project wall building.” He was objective and able
to straighten things out. He was not a prophet, a priest, nor a preacher, but a
political leader with a lot of Bible doctrine and he was a contemporary of
Malachi. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>After 12 years of governing Jerusalem, Nehemiah went back
to Babylon in 433 BC. It didn’t take 12 years to build the wall, but 12 years to
straighten everyone out. But as soon as he left, all the kooks, all the
legalists, the religionists came out of their holes. Neh. 5:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Moreover, from the day that I was appointed to be their
governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year to the thirty-second
year of King Artaxerxes, for twelve years, neither I nor my kinsmen have eaten
the governor's food allowance.” (Nehemiah 5:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Anyone who has risen to fame in America has always been criticized
by much lesser people. Examples are great generals like McArthur and Patton.
Other examples are great ministers or pastor-teachers. You may receive similar
treatment at work if you try to do your job as unto the Lord. The legalist scum
rise up and try to tear down anyone who has achieved some greatness. Bible
doctrine can take anyone and build them up and through the grace of God and
positive volition make them something great.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>During the absence of Nehemiah, there was a spiritual
decline in the Land as described in Malachi. Malachi described Jerusalem after
Nehemiah left. As long as he was there, things were fine. When he left, things
fell apart after three terms of office. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When a great leader leaves, all the legalists come out of
their holes. So God raised up a great prophet, the last one until John the
Baptist 400 years later, and then our Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is the
last prophet of Israel. There are no prophets today and Israel remains
dispersed among Gentile nations under the fifth cycle of discipline – the
Diaspora.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>After an unknown lapse of time, Nehemiah returned to
Jerusalem. With his return, they again had a great team with Nehemiah the
political ruler and Malachi the spiritual leader. One hundred years earlier,
Zechariah was the spiritual leader and Zerubbabel was the political leader. Neh.
13:6-7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But during all this time I was not in Jerusalem, for in the
thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I had gone to the king. After
some time, however, I asked leave from the king, and I came to Jerusalem and
learned about the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, by preparing a room
for him in the courts of the house of God.” (Nehemiah 13:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Nehemiah’s ministry in Jerusalem did not all occur at the
same time. The last dated prophecy was 518 BC in Zechariah 7:1. His ministry
was to bring the people back to Bible doctrine during the construction of the
temple, which was completed in 516 BC. </p>

<p class=Verses>“In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the LORD came
to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, which is Chislev.”
(Zechariah 7:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The ministry of Malachi was to bring the people back to
Bible doctrine with the temple. The spiritual decline in the Book of Malachi
was a foretaste of what would eventually destroy Israel. By application, a
parallel situation exists today, a situation which could very easily destroy our
nation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Domination of Religion - Malachi 1 </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Burden of Malachi </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is the title of Malachi. In Malachi 1:1, “oracle” <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>מַשָּׂא</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> (massa) and is the strongest Hebrew word for divine judgment
and means cursing. It is used for the sin unto death, for example, Saul. It is
used of the destruction of a nation under the last and most severe stage of
national divine discipline, the fifth cycle of discipline. The fifth cycle of
discipline is coming.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The oracle of the word of the LORD to Israel through Malachi.” 
(Malachi 1:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“The word of the Lord” means that grace precedes
judgment. Not even good leadership is going to change our country today. Bible
doctrine will do it or nothing! Socialism started in England before World War
II and the socialists and liberals were having a heyday under Mr. Neville
Chamberlain who was very similar in thinking to liberals in the United States
today. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The bowler and the umbrella and peace at any price. When
Mr. Chamberlain came back from meeting Adolf in the Berchtesgaden in the
Bavarian Alps, he made this wonderful announcement, “We will have peace in our
day.” That was a big day for the liberals. You see, Socialism was very strong
at that point in England. The trend to Socialism was already there. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Then what happened? Adolf pulled the rug out from
everyone and the next thing they knew, the British had their back to the wall. With
their back to the wall, no liberal can ever cut it. There never has been a
liberal that could do anything under a desperate situation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>That meant that Mr. Chamberlain had to go and they looked
around for a conservative with moral courage. So that famous conservative, Mr.
Winston Churchill, was called back. The situation was a total mess. The
liberals had disarmed the country. When Mad Adolf’s German legions took over
France in May of 1943 using a massive Keil and Kessel maneuver, the German
troops were on the shores of France, just a short hop from England. Mr.
Churchill couldn’t even find weapons for the troops. They had been destroyed. They
had to rob museums for flintlocks. They were doing troop drills with wooden
weapons. Gun legislation had taken its toll. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Where do you suppose they were able to find guns?
American citizens who owned weapons gave up their weapons and sent them to
England. I think I sent a 38 special with a four-inch barrel. They didn’t have
anything. The liberals had taken everything. Their factories were creaking and
groaning under Socialism. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Socialism had taken their weapons. The only weapons they
had were attached to their naval vessels. The situation was horrible. What did
Winston Churchill have? He had the mind of a conservative. Winston Churchill
was a man who operated on principle. So he stated the principle, “We will
fight.” With principle and with words, he built back a confidence in the
people. With American weapons and American help and with a conservative
administration the British went from zero to ninety-nine in a short period of
time. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>With the end of the war, the crisis was over and the
United States of America had bailed out the world by rearming Russia, England,
and France and practically everyone else. Everything was peaceable again. What
did England do with Mr. Churchill? They promptly dumped him. The British took
up right where Mr. Chamberlain had said “peace at any price.” They didn’t miss
a beat. Once that great man was voted out of the picture, the kooks again came
out of their holes, the liberals, the cowards, and draft dodgers all spouting
their socialist propaganda. Great Britain continues their Socialist decline. A
great man was on the scene for five years, but when the great man left the
scene, the whole heritage of conservatism disappeared. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Liberals aren’t even good businessmen. They never are. If
it weren’t for conservative businessmen, there wouldn’t be any way to get
taxes. The point here is that no man today on the scene can change this country,
no matter how great he is. We need such a man, but a man can’t do it. God has
to honor and bless and the principles of Bible doctrine have to get back into
American life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Degeneration of Israel</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Malachi 1:2, “I have loved you” is the qal perfect of
a <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>אהב</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>('âhab). This is a
dialogue between Jesus Christ and the Levitical priesthood which is supposed to
teach the Word of God. When a nation begins to go sour, it goes sour
spiritually before it affects anything else. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I have loved you,&quot; says the LORD. But you say,
&quot;How have You loved us?&quot; &quot;Was not Esau Jacob's brother?&quot;
declares the LORD. &quot;Yet I have loved Jacob;” (Malachi 1:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>These unbelieving priests were just like Esau. “But you
say” is negative volition with no response to God's love. In what way have you
loved us? What did you ever do for us?  He compares them to Esau which was a
horrible insult to the Jewish priesthood. The Jewish nation was founded on the
basis of spiritual birth, not physical birth.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is said to hate Esau and love Jacob. Why? This is an
expression of the divine attitude toward Esau’s rebellion, hatred of Bible
doctrine, negative volition and spurning the grace of God. However, Jacob
utilized the grace of God. God loved Jacob in a special way because he was a
believer in the plan of God. “Yet I have loved Jacob” is the qal active
participle of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>אהב</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>('âhab) and means “I
keep on loving Jacob.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Malachi 1:3, Jacob’s name became Israel and Israel
goes on forever. Esau became the father of the Edomites who were wiped out
totally in 70 AD. One side of the fence had Bible doctrine, the other had none.
The Jews in Malachi’s time were acting just like Esau. Religion was the worst
thing that could happen to Esau. </p>

<p class=Verses>“but I have hated Esau, and I have made his mountains a
desolation and appointed his inheritance for the jackals of the
wilderness.&quot;” (Malachi 1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“A desolation” refers to the fourth and fifth cycles of
divine discipline administered by God to the nation. “Jackals” refers to the basis
for judgment - a nation negative to Bible doctrine who has turned away from
God. Edom refused passage to Israel to get to the promised Land. This was a Satanic
hindrance. Num. 20:18-21. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Edom, however, said to him, &quot;You shall not pass through
us, or I will come out with the sword against you.&quot; Again, the sons of
Israel said to him, &quot;We will go up by the highway, and if I and my
livestock do drink any of your water, then I will pay its price. Let me only
pass through on my feet, nothing else.&quot; But he said, &quot;You shall not
pass through.&quot; And Edom came out against him with a heavy force and with a
strong hand. Thus Edom refused to allow Israel to pass through his territory;
so Israel turned away from him.” (Numbers 20:18-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Israel was involved in a series of battles all through
the Old Testament so that religion and pride would not come upon Israel. Saul
defeated the Edomites in 1 Samuel 14:47. David defeated the Edomites in 1 Kings
11:15-16.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“Now when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought
against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, the sons of Ammon, Edom,
the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines; and wherever he turned, he inflicted
punishment.” (1 Samuel 14:47, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For it came about, when David was in Edom, and Joab the
commander of the army had gone up to bury the slain, and had struck down every
male in Edom (for Joab and all Israel stayed there six months, until he had cut
off every male in Edom),” (1 Kings 11:15-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 875 BC, the Edomites allied with Moab and Ammon to
attack Israel all at once. They did not succeed. 2 Chron. 20:22. </p>

<p class=Verses>“When they began singing and praising, the LORD set ambushes
against the sons of Ammon, Moab and Mount Seir, who had come against Judah; so
they were routed.” (2 Chronicles 20:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Religion persecuted believers. Later on, under the reign
of Jehoram, religious minus doctrine, the Edomites defeated Israel. They made
tremendous inroads into the Southern Kingdom at this point. Amaziah had a
campaign to drive them out finally. 2 Chron. 25:11-12. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Now Amaziah strengthened himself and led his people forth, and
went to the Valley of Salt and struck down 10,000 of the sons of Seir. The sons
of Judah also captured 10,000 alive and brought them to the top of the cliff
and threw them down from the top of the cliff, so that they were all dashed to
pieces.” (2 Chronicles 25:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There was constant fighting against Edom. In the time of
Malachi, just like Esau, they were infiltrating their own land inwardly with
religion which was a hopeless situation. The priests were doing on the inside
what Edom was constantly trying to do on the outside. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Edomites banded with Nebuchadnezzar when Jerusalem
was destroyed under the fifth cycle of discipline in 586 BC and was so
impressed with their fighting that he left the Edomites to occupy the southern
part of Palestine. They settled down in the Land. Jeremiah warned that the
Edomites would do this in Jeremiah 49, Lamentations 4:21, and Amos 1:11-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, Who dwells in the
land of Uz; But the cup will come around to you as well, You will become drunk
and make yourself naked.” (Lamentations 4:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Thus says the LORD, &quot;For three transgressions of Edom and
for four I will not revoke its punishment, Because he pursued his brother with
the sword, While he stifled his compassion; His anger also tore continually,
And he maintained his fury forever. &quot;So I will send fire upon Teman And it
will consume the citadels of Bozrah.&quot;” (Amos 1:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Jews took a soft attitude toward the Edomites and
they came in for the kill twice - in 586 BC and in 70 AD. In 70 AD, 20,000
Edomite military troops were let inside the gates of Jerusalem to help the Jews
defend the city. They offered to help in defending the city from the Romans. As
soon as they came inside, they immediately started slaughtering Jews and
robbing. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s command was always the same, “Wipe out the
Edomites.” Occasionally a nation is commanded by God to be wiped out. Why? If
the nation of mad dogs continued to live, they would destroy the human race. Israel
ignored God's command and He disciplined them.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>No Edomite survived the siege of Jerusalem in 70 AD. God
wiped them out at that time. The Romans wiped them out to a person. The Romans
wiped them out because they said they were lawless and maniacal killers, like
the Mongols of Genghis Khan. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Malachi 1:4, “We have been beaten down” is the qal
imperfect of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>רשׁשׁ</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(râshash) and means
to be defeated, to be whipped. “We will return” is the pual perfect of <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שׁוּב</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(shûb) and means they will return with
the attitude of a fighter. The Lord says, “I will tear down.” In the first
judgment in 332 BC, the Nabataeans attacked and fought for a generation and
drove Edom into a pocket, a corner. The final judgment was in 70 AD. “Indignation
forever” is the Lake of Fire where the unbelieving priests and the Edomites
will spend eternity. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Though Edom says, &quot;We have been beaten down, but we will
return and build up the ruins&quot;; thus says the LORD of hosts, &quot;They
may build, but I will tear down; and men will call them the wicked territory,
and the people toward whom the LORD is indignant forever.&quot;” (Malachi 1:4,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Malachi 1:5, the unbelieving priests’ eyes will see
when the Lord will be magnified apart from and beyond the Israelites. The Gospel
will be taken by the Gentiles around the world. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Your eyes will see this and you will say, &quot;The LORD be
magnified beyond the border of Israel!&quot;” (Malachi 1:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Seven Warnings to Israel of the Coming Fifth Cycle of
Discipline </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There were seven warnings to Israel of the coming fifth
cycle of discipline. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The gift of tongues from 30-70 AD. Isaiah 22:11; Acts 2:1-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And you made a reservoir between the two walls For the waters
of the old pool. But you did not depend on Him who made it, Nor did you take
into consideration Him who planned it long ago.” (Isaiah 22:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“When the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in
one place. And suddenly there came from heaven a noise like a violent rushing
wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. And there appeared
to them tongues as of fire distributing themselves, and they rested on each one
of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with
other tongues, as the Spirit was giving them utterance.” (Acts 2:1-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The virgin birth of Jesus Christ. Isaiah 7:14. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold,
a virgin will be with child and bear a son, and she will call His name
Immanuel.” (Isaiah 7:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Betrayal by Judas. Zech. 11:12-13. </p>

<p class=Verses>“I said to them, &quot;If it is good in your sight, give me my
wages; but if not, never mind!&quot; So they weighed out thirty shekels of
silver as my wages. Then the LORD said to me, &quot;Throw it to the potter,
that magnificent price at which I was valued by them.&quot; So I took the
thirty shekels of silver and threw them to the potter in the house of the
LORD.” (Zechariah 11:12-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Isaiah 53:9, “in His death” is in the plural in the
Hebrew and refers to the spiritual death and physical death of Jesus Christ on
the Cross. He first paid the penalty for all of the sins of mankind by
spiritual death. The “blood of Christ” is the term used for this. He dismissed
His own human spirit and died physically because His atoning work was finished.
</p>

<p class=Verses>“His grave was assigned with wicked men, Yet He was with a rich

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The warning of the siege of Jerusalem. The legions of
Titus and Vespasian took Jerusalem. Well over 1 million people were killed in
the 90-day campaign and 97,000 lived to be scattered among Gentile nations.
This warning was to keep believers out of Jerusalem at the time of the siege. Luke
21:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then
recognize that her desolation is near.” (Luke 21:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Facts Concerning the Priests</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The unsaved priests had no relationship with God,
therefore no divine good production. Mal. 1:6. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot; 'A son honors his father, and a servant his master.
Then if I am a father, where is My honor? And if I am a master, where is My
respect?' says the LORD of hosts to you, O priests who despise My name. But you
say, 'How have we despised Your name?'” (Malachi 1:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Malachi was speaking to the priests and saying there must
be a father-son relationship first with God, that you must be born again! In a
father-son relationship, a son is to honor and respect his father. The son may
not love him, but he is to respect his father. The father is the authority in
the family, the father loves, the father provides, and the father trains by
communication. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the spiritual life, there must be a servant-master
relationship – the believer’s relationship with God before the believer can
produce any divine good. There must be a relationship before production. For
the priests, there was neither. The reading of Scripture and ritual in the
temple became religion and religion despises the name of God, His essence and
doesn’t even know it is despising Him. This is the ignorance, stupidity, and
human viewpoint of religion. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Operation of the Priests</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They used polluted bread at the altar. Mal. 1:7. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You are presenting defiled food upon My altar. But you
say, 'How have we defiled You?' In that you say, 'The table of the LORD is to
be despised.'” (Malachi 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They used blind, lame, and sick animals for the sacrifices
instead of spotless animals that were in perfect health. Mal. 1:8-10. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But when you present the blind for sacrifice, is it not
evil? And when you present the lame and sick, is it not evil? Why not offer it
to your governor? Would he be pleased with you? Or would he receive you
kindly?&quot; says the LORD of hosts.” (Malachi 1:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They were trying to bring in the Millennium as religion
always does. One day, there will be the true Millennium. Mal. 1:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For from the rising of the sun even to its setting, My
name will be great among the nations, and in every place incense is going to be
offered to My name, and a grain offering that is pure; for My name will be
great among the nations,&quot; says the LORD of hosts.” (Malachi 1:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They tried to corrupt the person of Christ. The use of leaven
made Christ a sinner. Mal. 1:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But you are profaning it, in that you say, 'The table of
the Lord is defiled, and as for its fruit, its food is to be despised.'”
(Malachi 1:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They tried to corrupt the work of Christ. His work lines
up with His person. If they corrupt His person, they cripple His work. Mal.
1:13-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You also say, 'My, how tiresome it is!' And you
disdainfully sniff at it,&quot; says the LORD of hosts, &quot;and you bring
what was taken by robbery and what is lame or sick; so you bring the offering!
Should I receive that from your hand?&quot; says the LORD. &quot;But cursed be
the swindler who has a male in his flock and vows it, but sacrifices a
blemished animal to the Lord, for I am a great King,&quot; says the LORD of
hosts, &quot;and My name is feared among the nations.&quot;” (Malachi 1:13-14,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Judgment of Religion - Malachi 2</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pattern of national disaster or why a nation is
destroyed. The function of the priesthood was to handle the written Word, not
spoken revelation as the prophets and to teach Bible doctrine regarding the
meaning of the Jewish rituals. They were custodians of the Scripture in a time
when the Canon was not completed. They were responsible for evangelism within
the nation of Israel and to other nations. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They were responsible for setting the pattern for Divine
Institution #4, Nationalism. God’s order for government is nationalism. Why separate
nations? So people won’t go power mad. So that all people will be represented.
So that people will have privacy. So that there will be private enterprise and
protection of property. So there will be the rule of law – written law. So
there could be industry free from government pressure and coercion. When
Socialism takes over a nation, the government destroys industries through
repressive laws and incompetence. The result is always the same, the nation goes
broke. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Indictment and Failure of the Priesthood</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Grace always precedes judgment - the five cycles of
discipline is called “the curse” in Malachi 2:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;And now this commandment is for you, O priests. &quot;If
you do not listen, and if you do not take it to heart to give honor to My
name,&quot; says the LORD of hosts, &quot;then I will send the curse upon you
and I will curse your blessings; and indeed, I have cursed them already,
because you are not taking it to heart.” (Malachi 2:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There was the fact that the priests were unbelievers and
that they are said to have animal excrement, dung, or “refuse” on their faces
in Malachi 2:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Behold, I am going to rebuke your offspring, and I will
spread refuse on your faces, the refuse of your feasts; and you will be taken
away with it.” (Malachi 2:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“I will spread refuse on your faces” means to scatter the
excrement of the animal sacrifices. Part of the animal sacrifice was assigned
to the priest for eating, but there was a specific order concerning the waste
products. The waste was to be taken outside of the camp. Exodus 29:14; Lev.
4:11-12; Exodus 29:14; Lev. 8:16; Lev. 16:27; Num. 19:5. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But the flesh of the bull and its hide and its refuse,
you shall burn with fire outside the camp; it is a sin offering.” (Exodus
29:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But the bull of the sin offering and the goat of the sin
offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, shall
be taken outside the camp, and they shall burn their hides, their flesh, and
their refuse in the fire.” (Leviticus 16:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“'Then the heifer shall be burned in his sight; its hide and
its flesh and its blood, with its refuse, shall be burned.” (Numbers 19:5,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Since the dung was to go outside the camp, then dung on
the face of the priest meant they were actually outside the camp, meaning they
were unbelievers. They were still in their sins. They were as spiritual as a
pile of dung, a manure pile. The priests were going to be scattered just as
dung was scattered outside the camp. Wherever the Jew goes in the world, they are
regarded just like dung, part of the curse, they are disliked. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This has happened numerous times from 400 BC to 1 AD, but
it actually anticipated 70 AD, about 500 years in the future. Instead of
communicating Bible doctrine, the priests were communicating religion and the
country suffered. “You will be taken away” refers to the Romans who destroyed
Jerusalem in 70 AD. “With it” refers to the animal waste. You will be taken
outside Israel and scattered. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Levitical priesthood was appointed on the basis of being
a direct descendant of Aaron. During the Golden Calf incident, the only ones
who did not enter into that was the family of Levi. Exodus 32:26; Num. 1:49. </p>

<p class=Verses>“then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said,
&quot;Whoever is for the LORD, come to me!&quot; And all the sons of Levi
gathered together to him.” (Exodus 32:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Only the tribe of Levi you shall not number, nor shall
you take their census among the sons of Israel.” (Numbers 1:49, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Levitical line became obscured especially after 323
BC when the rabbis began to take the place of priests and prophets. Therefore,
they functioned in a religious system of apostacy called Judaism, but it is
ritual only. So the function of the priesthood was set aside and wherever Jews
function today, they function under a rabbi. Since 70 AD, there has been no
Levitical priesthood. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Church Age, there are only two bonafide rituals.
There is baptism to publicly proclaim the believer’s earlier expression of faith
alone in Jesus Christ for salvation. Baptism can be performed voluntarily by
the believer, but is not mandated. The second Church Age ritual is the most
important - the Lord’s Supper, the Eucharist where the congregation celebrates
by remembrance and worship the work of our Lord Jesus Christ on the Cross. This
important ritual is mandated and is often conducted in the local church once a
month. Beyond these two rituals, is apostacy.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Levitical Contract</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Malachi 2:4 refers to the Aaronic priesthood. Reuben lost
as firstborn and the rulership went to Judah. Reuben lost the priesthood that
went to the family of Levi, the family of Aaron. Reuben lost the double portion
to Joseph from Ephraim and Manasseh. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Then you will know that I have sent this commandment to
you, that My covenant may continue with Levi,&quot; says the LORD of hosts.”
(Malachi 2:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ritual was not the primary function. It was communication
of doctrine with sounds and visuals. There was no excuse for failure because
they have a covenant with God. This is the priestly contract and they had
failed.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Levi was faithful during the Golden Calf incident. Aaron
failed but the tribe of Levi did not fail. The Golden Calf incident was the
first religious thing to hit Israel after the Exodus. Religion would have
destroyed Israel. The Levities were with doctrine all the way at that time. You
will not own land but you will be communicators of Bible doctrine. Exodus
32:25-26.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now when Moses saw that the people were out of control—for
Aaron had let them get out of control to be a derision among their enemies—
then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, &quot;Whoever is for the
LORD, come to me!&quot; And all the sons of Levi gathered together to him.”
(Exodus 32:25-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Phineas was especially faithful during the wilderness journeys.
He was the grandson of Aaron and became the high priest eventually. When the
contract was first given, they were born-again, they studied doctrine, and they
communicated doctrine. Num. 25:10-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, &quot;Phinehas the son
of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned away My wrath from the sons
of Israel in that he was jealous with My jealousy among them, so that I did not
destroy the sons of Israel in My jealousy. &quot;Therefore say, 'Behold, I give
him My covenant of peace; and it shall be for him and his descendants after
him, a covenant of a perpetual priesthood, because he was jealous for his God
and made atonement for the sons of Israel.'&quot;” (Numbers 25:10-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The actual contract had repercussions on the Land. If the
contract was fulfilled, the Land would have prosperity, but that depended upon
Bible doctrine. If it was not fulfilled, the Land would have cursing. Deut.
33:8-11. The content of the Levitical contract can be found in Numbers 3:5-13
and Numbers 8:14-19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Of Levi he said, &quot;Let Your Thummim and Your Urim belong
to Your godly man, Whom You proved at Massah, With whom You contended at the
waters of Meribah; Who said of his father and his mother, 'I did not consider
them'; And he did not acknowledge his brothers, Nor did he regard his own sons,
For they observed Your word, And kept Your covenant.” (Deuteronomy 33:8-9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;O LORD, bless his substance, And accept the work of his
hands; Shatter the loins of those who rise up against him, And those who hate
him, so that they will not rise again.&quot;” (Deuteronomy 33:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Function of the Levitical Covenant</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Members of the Levitical priesthood were to be born again
and occupied with Christ. In Malachi 2:5-6, “reverence” in the piel stem is
strong. “True instruction was in his mouth” means that the Levitical priests
were to know and teach Bible doctrine. “Unrighteousness was not found on his
lips” means they were to stay in fellowship. “He walked with Me in peace and
uprightness” means the priests were to exercise faith-rest and stay in
fellowship with God. “He turned many back from iniquity” means they were to evangelize
all unbelievers. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;My covenant with him was one of life and peace, and I
gave them to him as an object of reverence; so he revered Me and stood in awe
of My name. &quot;True instruction was in his mouth and unrighteousness was not
found on his lips; he walked with Me in peace and uprightness, and he turned
many back from iniquity.” (Malachi 2:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Responsibility of the Levitical Contract</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Malachi 2:7 states that the priests were to “preserve
knowledge” meaning they were study, keep, and guard Bible doctrine. You cannot
communicate what you do not know. “Men should seek instruction from his mouth”
means that there must be free will in teaching Bible doctrine and doctrine must
be made available. In many places doctrinal teaching is not available. This
verse says the priests were to make a place for Bible doctrine to be available.
</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For the lips of a priest should preserve knowledge, and
men should seek instruction from his mouth; for he is the messenger of the LORD
of hosts.” (Malachi 2:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“He is the messenger of the Lord of hosts” refers to the
actual intake of Bible doctrine and application to life. Without the intake of
Bible doctrine and application in the nation’s believers, the nation
degenerates and receives divine discipline from God to turn the people back to
His mandates. This is the key verse of Malachi. A nation cannot exist without
the teaching of Bible doctrine. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Failure of the Priests</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Malachi 2:8, “turned aside” is the qal perfect of <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>סוּר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(sûr) and means they have deviated from
the way. They have failed to learn doctrine. They have failed to provide a
place where Bible doctrine is taught. They have failed to communicate Bible
doctrine. Since they did not provide these three things, the people could not
operate in the proper spiritual framework.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But as for you, you have turned aside from the way; you
have caused many to stumble by the instruction; you have corrupted the covenant
of Levi,&quot; says the LORD of hosts.” (Malachi 2:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“You have corrupted” is in the piel and means they have been
infiltrated with something false that spreads and has neutralized the
possibility of understanding doctrinal issues. The Levitical Covenant is
described in Exodus 32, Numbers 25, and Deuteronomy 33. This was the basis for
the function of the priesthood in communicating doctrine. Because they had
failed before the Lord, they had lost the respect of the people. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Malachi 2:9, “made you despised and abased” refers to the
attitude of the people toward the Levitical priesthood. They would allow people
to walk all over them. When this happened, the priesthood had become corrupt,
then someone else was brought onto the scene. Enter Malachi.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;So I also have made you despised and abased before all
the people, just as you are not keeping My ways but are showing partiality in
the instruction.” (Malachi 2:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Are not keeping My ways” means no divine viewpoint or
divine guidance. “Showing partiality in the instruction” means they were
catering to people. “Partiality” is the qal active participle of <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>נשׂא</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(nâśâ') and means to be partial, to respect
one person over another. When doctrine is deemphasized, then they became
respectful of certain people. By catering to people, spiritual leadership loses
the respect of people. Spiritual leadership must not cater to people. Ever! You
can’t be fair and just and cater to people. Spiritual leadership must never be
guilty of favoritism. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To cater to people is to be flattened by people. To love
the Lord is to be helpful to people by learning and teaching the Word. The
Levitical priesthood failed because in the interpretation of the Mosaic Law,
they had been catering to people and not to the Word. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When you respect people above the Word, God will allow
those people to neutralize you, flatten you, to walk all over you. The false
interpretation of the Law and respect for people would have been suppressed by the
teaching of Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Indictment of the People </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The second cause for the destruction of a nation is the
disintegration of mental attitudes and volition. This is the dissolving of
divine institutions of the people by treachery. The whole concept of the divine
institutions is to protect your volition in the Angelic Conflict. First, the
priests went apostate, then as the priests degenerated and turned from the
teaching of Bible doctrine, then the people followed. When you go all out to
train a militia to protect the nation, there comes a time when you have to
strike, take plunder, and to progress. Without Bible doctrine in their souls,
they cannot function under pressure and they regress.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The principle of treachery is found in Malachi 2:10. “Do
we not all have one father” refers to Jewish believers because all believers
have one Father. “Has not one God created us?” refers to Jesus Christ as the Creator
of all that exists and the only Savior. “We deal treacherously” refers to
deceit and the attack on the four divine institutions. Gen. 2 through Gen. 11.
“Profane the covenant” is to mentally despise Bible doctrine and to substitute
idolatry, to get into the Phallic cult.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Do we not all have one father? Has not one God created
us? Why do we deal treacherously each against his brother so as to profane the
covenant of our fathers?” (Malachi 2:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Man was created to resolve the Angelic Conflict and the
divine institutions protect mankind so they will be able to make a choice
concerning Jesus Christ. John 1:3; Heb. 1:10; Col. 1:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him
nothing came into being that has come into being.” (John 1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And, &quot;YOU, LORD, IN THE BEGINNING LAID THE FOUNDATION OF
THE EARTH, AND THE HEAVENS ARE THE WORKS OF YOUR HANDS;” (Hebrews 1:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For by Him all things were created, both in the heavens and on
earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or
authorities—all things have been created through Him and for Him.” (Colossians
1:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The cause of treachery is religion. Human good is an
abomination to God. Morality is the basis for the operation of the divine
institutions as expressed in the Ten Commandments. In Malachi 2:11, “the sanctuary
of the Lord” refers to the sanctuary of the second temple, completed in 516 BC
- it had been profaned. Bible doctrine has been knocked out because the temple
was the basic audio visual for teaching doctrine and when they knocked out
doctrine they only had ritual, no reality.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Judah has dealt treacherously, and an abomination has
been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the sanctuary
of the LORD which He loves and has married the daughter of a foreign god.”
(Malachi 2:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Has married the daughter of a foreign god” means that when
there is negative volition to Bible doctrine, a vacuum opens in the soul and
religion is drawn in. A Jew marries a foreign woman and takes her false
religion with him. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Judgment because of treachery can be found in Malachi
2:12. “For the man who does this, may the Lord cut off from the tents of Jacob”
refers to the believer receiving the maximum divine discipline that God can
administer – the sin unto death. For the unbeliever, God will administer
judgment of a nation under the fifth cycle of discipline. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;As for the man who does this, may the LORD cut off from
the tents of Jacob everyone who awakes and answers, or who presents an offering
to the LORD of hosts.” (Malachi 2:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Everyone who awakes and answers” refers to the ones calling
– the priests of the Phallic cult and the ones answering to sexual activity and
ritual. Both are translated as nouns but are actually participles. This is also
explained in Nehemiah 13:23-29. </p>

<p class=Verses>“In those days I also saw that the Jews had married women from
Ashdod, Ammon and Moab. As for their children, half spoke in the language of
Ashdod, and none of them was able to speak the language of Judah, but the
language of his own people.” (Nehemiah 13:23-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Do we then hear about you that you have committed all
this great evil by acting unfaithfully against our God by marrying foreign
women?&quot;” (Nehemiah 13:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the
priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites.” (Nehemiah
13:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As these husbands were going up to the groves to
fornicate, they also were going into the temple to offer animal sacrifices as
per the Levitical code. They were not offering confession of sin sacrifices but
salvation sacrifices. This was the same situation as Hebrews 6:1-6. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For in the case of those who have once been enlightened and
have tasted of the heavenly gift and have been made partakers of the Holy
Spirit, and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come,
and then have fallen away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance,
since they again crucify to themselves the Son of God and put Him to open
shame.” (Hebrews 6:4-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Wives were deserted by their husbands. The women were
frustrated, crying, and screaming out. The men covered their activities with an
animal sacrifice. The whole system of learning doctrine according to the
Levitical offerings had broken down because of the attack of religion on Divine
Institution #2 - Marriage. Their tears did no good. Mal. 2:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;This is another thing you do: you cover the altar of the
LORD with tears, with weeping and with groaning, because He no longer regards
the offering or accepts it with favor from your hand.” (Malachi 2:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Disintegration of Divine Institutions as Illustrated
by Marriage</u> </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Husbands would not admit they have been going up to the
groves. This type of man can live a lie. Another type of man gets a guilt
complex and blabs it all over the place. There is an honest fornicator. There
is a dishonest fornicator and this is describing the latter. He is using the
animal sacrifices as a cover. People use church as a cover for their
fornication. “For what reason?”  refers to Divine Institution #2 - Marriage. Mal.
2:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Yet you say, 'For what reason?' Because the LORD has
been a witness between you and the wife of your youth, against whom you have
dealt treacherously, though she is your companion and your wife by covenant.”
(Malachi 2:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Malachi 2:15, “But not one has done” refers to God’s
creation of Adam and Eve. One (breath) with air fit their lungs, satisfied
them, and matched the man for the woman who fit each other. “Remnant of the
Spirit” means God had more than enough breath to make three Eves, but He didn’t
make three. He made one a perfect match for Adam. This is written to straighten
out those who think harems are the way to go. David, Solomon, etc. all had
harems. Malachi has the last word on it.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But not one has done so who has a remnant of the Spirit.
And what did that one do while he was seeking a godly offspring? Take heed then
to your spirit, and let no one deal treacherously against the wife of your
youth.” (Malachi 2:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“While he was seeking a godly offspring?” refers to Adam
seeking a godly offspring. Under monogamy you develop properly. Divine Institution
#3 - Family means there is one father and one mother. This is the rightful,
lawful heritage of any child. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Malachi 2:16 says the Lord “hates” divorce with three
exceptions. The word “hate” is an emotion that God does not possess. This is
called an anthropopathism that is used in the Bible as language of
accommodation to illustrate God's divine policy to mankind regarding divorce.  “Him
who covers his garment with wrong” is an idiom for hatred of a wife. They got
rid of their wives with whom they were “no longer compatible” with a legal
cloak, a divorce scheme, a legal system of declaring the woman unclean. For
instance, when she touched a dead horse or entered a house where a dead person
was still inside, etc.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For I hate divorce,&quot; says the LORD, the God of
Israel, &quot;and him who covers his garment with wrong,&quot; says the LORD of
hosts. &quot;So take heed to your spirit, that you do not deal
treacherously.&quot;” (Malachi 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Mosaic Law was to be used to protect the woman. They
used it to get rid of the woman. “Take heed to your spirit” refers to your wife
in marriage, that you do not deal treacherously with her. Note, this is to the
man! They had rationalized away their sin and justified it in their minds. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Malachi 2:17, “You have wearied the Lord with your
words” means literally that you have bored the Lord with your words. When
people get bored, they step outside the divine institutions.  “Wearied” is
another anthropopathism ascribed to God to show His attitude. Boredom is a
total lack of feeling, a total lack of interest. “Everyone who does evil is
good in the sight of the Lord” is the false doctrine of the liberals - the
fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man. The women became bitter when
their husbands went down to the groves for the 100th time. The men rationalized
and the women got bitter. This destroyed a nation!</p>

<p class=Verses>“You have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet you say,
&quot;How have we wearied Him?&quot; In that you say, &quot;Everyone who does
evil is good in the sight of the LORD, and He delights in them,&quot; or,
&quot;Where is the God of justice?&quot;” (Malachi 2:17, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God's Answer: Bible Doctrine or Judgment – Malachi 3 </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Plan of God Centers in Christ</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Malachi 3:1-6. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Behold, I am going to send My messenger, and he will
clear the way before Me. And the Lord, whom you seek, will suddenly come to His
temple; and the messenger of the covenant, in whom you delight, behold, He is
coming,&quot; says the LORD of hosts.” (Malachi 3:1, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;He will sit as a smelter and purifier of silver, and He
will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver, so that they
may present to the LORD offerings in righteousness.” (Malachi 3:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For I, the LORD, do not change; therefore you, O sons of
Jacob, are not consumed.” (Malachi 3:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Judgment of God Centers on Man</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Malachi 3:7, the importance of evangelism and the return
of Jesus Christ is the context. There is also the importance of confession of
sin to God the Father and the intake and application of Bible doctrine. “Days
of your fathers” refer to the days of the Jews returning under Zerubbabel and
Zechariah and Joshua the high priest in 516 BC. Apostacy began hitting prior to
420 BC. Lack of doctrine, lack of salt and light, led to the cycles of divine discipline,
military invasion and then horrible slavery. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from
My statutes and have not kept them. Return to Me, and I will return to
you,&quot; says the LORD of hosts. &quot;But you say, 'How shall we return?'”
(Malachi 3:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Turned aside” means to turn aside from a norm and
standard – for the unbeliever, the Gospel and the believer, Bible doctrine. “Statutes”
refers to the Mosaic Law, which is divided into three parts: commandments,
ordinances (theology) and judgments (civil code). Ordinances were the feasts,
offerings, etc. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Have not kept” is the qal perfect of <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שׁמר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(shâmar) and means did not guard Divine
Institution #4, Nationalism and Bible doctrine in the believers’ souls that
keeps preserving the land. “Return to Me” is the qal imperative of <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שׁוּב</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(shûb) and for the unbeliever, it means “Come
to Me.” For the believer, it means to confess known sins to God the Father and
regain the fellowship with God and return to the intake and application of
Bible doctrine.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The following is an illustration of national failure. It
has nothing to do with the mechanics of evangelism or confession of sins. In Malachi
3:8, the people had ignored the divine institutions and now they had neglected
God and their nation. “Will a man rob God?” means to defraud  God. It does not
mean to rob as a criminal robs a bank. It means as a treasurer to keep on
putting a little money into their own account, a little under the table stuff
and cons you out of money through some system. “Rob” is the qal active
participle of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>קבע</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(qâba‛) and means
this is a continual thing. Tithes and offerings were the responsibility of
every wage earner in Israel. It was like our income tax. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Will a man rob God? Yet you are robbing Me! But you say,
'How have we robbed You?' In tithes and offerings.” (Malachi 3:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The people weren’t giving tithes to the Levites to
maintain the temple as mandated in Numbers 18:21-24. They weren’t giving tithes
to the Lord’s feasts and sacrifices. They were neglecting the poor. Why?
Because of no salvation or no right mental attitude in the believers.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;To the sons of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe
in Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service which they perform,
the service of the tent of meeting. &quot;The sons of Israel shall not come
near the tent of meeting again, or they will bear sin and die. &quot;Only the
Levites shall perform the service of the tent of meeting, and they shall bear
their iniquity; it shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations,
and among the sons of Israel they shall have no inheritance. &quot;For the
tithe of the sons of Israel, which they offer as an offering to the LORD, I
have given to the Levites for an inheritance; therefore I have said concerning
them, 'They shall have no inheritance among the sons of Israel.'&quot;”
(Numbers 18:21-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Offerings was also the responsibility of every believer
in Israel. No percentage is mentioned as in 1 Corinthians 16:2. From the
distribution of this you can see it was peculiar to Israel. Gentile nations did
not have Levitical priests, temples to maintain, or sacrifices to offer. </p>

<p class=Verses>“On the first day of every week each one of you is to put aside
and save, as he may prosper, so that no collections be made when I come.” (1
Corinthians 16:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The indictment comes in Malachi 3:9. “You are cursed” is
the niphil passive participle of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>ארר</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>('ârar) and means
you are constantly being cursed. They were being cursed because they had not
been faithful to the Abrahamic, Palestinic, Davidic and New covenants. They had
thrown over Divine Institution #4, Nationalism. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You are cursed with a curse, for you are robbing Me, the
whole nation of you!” (Malachi 3:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“With a curse” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>מארה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>(me'êrâh) and means an execration, with an abomination, a maximum
curse. This is the nation going down altogether. They were in the process of
being cursed as they were approaching the fifth cycle of discipline from God. “For
you are robbing Me” means the entire nation had failed. This is the failure of
Jewish unbelievers and believers in taxes and offerings. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Malachi 3:10 provides the continuation of the
illustration with the solution, showing when people get back under the divine
institutions and Bible doctrine, then things begin to prosper. “Bring” is the hiphil
imperative of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>בּוא</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(bô') and means
cause to come, therefore bring. This is the mood of command and is causative. They
should be motivated to bring tithes. There must be motivation before you will
give properly. This is a command to all citizens of Judah in 420 BC. The
unbeliever is to function under Divine Institution #4, Nationalism and the
believer is to function under Bible doctrine. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, so that there
may be food in My house, and test Me now in this,&quot; says the LORD of hosts,
&quot;if I will not open for you the windows of heaven and pour out for you a
blessing until it overflows.” (Malachi 3:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Into the storehouse” is literally, into the house of the
treasury. Be motivated to bring these taxes to the treasury, like the treasury
of the United States. The temple was the most secure and was the bank vault of
Israel. It was a national treasury. For the unbeliever, Divine Institution #4,
Nationalism and for the believer, to grow in Bible doctrine and do all as unto
the Lord. Col. 3:23; Rom. 13:1-7. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Whatever you do, do your work heartily, as for the Lord rather
than for men,” (Colossians 3:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For because of this you also pay taxes, for rulers are
servants of God, devoting themselves to this very thing. Render to all what is
due them: tax to whom tax is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear;
honor to whom honor.” (Romans 13:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Malachi 3:10, “so that there may be” is the qal
imperfect of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>היה</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(hâyâh) and is a
purpose clause. The imperfect means that there will always be a need for funds
to operate a national entity. “Food” means provisions. Provision for what? To
run a government. Provision for a government to function. “In My house” is a reference
to the second temple, operated by priests and the Levities who at this time
were starving and begging rather than performing the spiritual functions of a
nation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Test Me now in this” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>בּחן</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(bâchan) and means to test, an assayer testing ore such
as gold. Prove My essence, prove My grace! God proves His grace by the
prosperity of a nation to the unbeliever. God demonstrates His grace to the
believer by both national and spiritual blessings. They did and had another 100
years of blessing. Then the rise of the Hellenistic monarchies to test Israel.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“If I will not open for you the windows of heaven” are literally
the sluices of the flood gates. This is economic prosperity in a national
agricultural economy. “And pour out for you a blessing until it overflows” is
in the hiphil and means caused to be poured out. There are certain laws with
regard to Nationalism and when these are observed, the blessing is there. An illustration
is the rise of the United Sates through the free enterprise system. There was
no income tax until 1913. Jefferson was off and Alexander Hamilton was on as
far as Bible doctrine. Jefferson said all people are born equal. No. The only
equality at birth is that we are born spiritually dead. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Malachi 3:11, we have God's protection for the
believers in the land, the salt of the earth. “Will not destroy” is in the hiphil
stem of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שׁחת</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(shâchath) and means
to overthrow. “Fruits of the ground” and “cast its grapes” both refer to God's
prosperity blessings in an agricultural economy. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Then I will rebuke the devourer for you, so that it will
not destroy the fruits of the ground; nor will your vine in the field cast its
grapes,&quot; says the LORD of hosts.” (Malachi 3:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Malachi 3:12, we have national prosperity described
further. “All the nations will call you blessed” is in the piel stem of <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>אשׁר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>('âshar) and is an intensive statement by
others. “A delightful land” refers to conditions that can only occur in a
nation functioning under the Divine Institutions, but ultimately because there
are enough believers in the nation positive to Bible doctrine and growing
spiritually. Whether a nation survives or not is how well they take in Bible
doctrine and become preservatives and light. You will be put into areas of
influence where you will have a voice! </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;All the nations will call you blessed, for you shall be
a delightful land,&quot; says the LORD of hosts.” (Malachi 3:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Malachi 3:13, they condemn themselves by their own
deeds. “Arrogant” is negative volition towards Bible doctrine. It means to be
hard, obstinate, disoriented to grace and disoriented to the plan of God. It is
a thought pattern or mental attitude expressed in words, that you have no
interest in Bible doctrine! “Yet you say” means to talk back with a pretense of
innocence. A principle of conversation is that what you say is as important as
what you think. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Your words have been arrogant against Me,&quot; says the
LORD. &quot;Yet you say, 'What have we spoken against You?'” (Malachi 3:13,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Malachi 3:14 provides the answer. The rest of the chapter
is talking about service. Believers were thinking it was useless to serve God.
The Angelic Conflict had swallowed them up. They believed that God had never
done anything for them. “What profit” emphasizes the details of life. Why doesn’t
God give me money? Why hasn’t God given me my right kind of man yet? Why hasn’t
God prospered me? Why hasn’t God done this or that? </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You have said, 'It is vain to serve God; and what profit
is it that we have kept His charge, and that we have walked in mourning before
the LORD of hosts?” (Malachi 3:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“We have kept His charge” means to guard the rituals, the
ordinances, Codex #2 of the Mosaic Law. Religious people keep the ritual, but
do not know the reality of Bible doctrine behind the ritual. They have
corrupted salvation by grace and they have corrupted their spiritual life with
legalism. “We have walked in mourning before the Lord of hosts” means that
although it was tough for them, they worked it in somehow. Like a basset hound’s
stubborn temperament. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Malachi 3:15 seems to indicate that the wicked prosper. “We
call the arrogant blessed” refers to  a person who possesses the details of
life that include money, success, pleasure, health, sex, friends, loved ones, social
life, status symbols, and materialistic things.</p>

<p class=Verses>“'So now we call the arrogant blessed; not only are the doers
of wickedness built up but they also test God and escape.'&quot;” (Malachi
3:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is not one who has the mental attitude sin of pride,
but someone who has the necessary signs of prosperity. A believer without
doctrine associates happiness with the details of life. Now, the Bible is not
against the details of life and possessing the details of life is not wrong. A
believer with Bible doctrine can enjoy the details of life. But you can never
emphasize the details of life over doctrine! </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“The doers of wickedness” means that they made wickedness
out of the details of life. “Built up” means they prosper. Look how happy those
people are with the details of life, we should also go after the details of
life and be happy. They literally tempted God and still escaped His divine
discipline. They would do something against God and seem to get away with it.
Of course they did not! </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Faithful Remnant </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Malachi 3:16, “Feared the Lord” means the remnant of
positive believers used faith-rest and continued to learn and apply Bible
doctrine. “Spoke to one another” refers to a communicator speaking publicly to
a group, often daily. This is fellowshipping in the Word, learning Bible
doctrine. Heb. 10:25.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then those who feared the LORD spoke to one another, and the
LORD gave attention and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before
Him for those who fear the LORD and who esteem His name.” (Malachi 3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of
some, but encouraging one another; and all the more as you see the day drawing
near.” (Hebrews 10:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Malachi 3:16, “the Lord gave attention” is in the hiphil
stem of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>קשׁב</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(qâshab) and means
the Lord was caused to draw near. “And heard it” means He listened with
pleasure.  “A book of remembrance was written” is the Lord’s scrap book that
has the names of those who love Him, who respond to Him, those who are positive
to Bible doctrine, and those whose thinking is being renovated to be like His
own thinking. “For those” means the book of remembrance has names of believers
that fulfill this principle. “Who fear the Lord” refers to those who learned
Bible doctrine and developed the capacity to love the Lord. “Who esteem His
name” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>חשׁב</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(châshab) and means
to think categorically, to keep on thinking categorically. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Malachi 3:17, “They will be Mine” refers to an intimate
relationship. They belong to God in a special way in the spiritual life. “On
that day” refers to the Millennial reign of the Lord Jesus Christ on earth for
a 1,000 literal years. “I prepare My own possession” refers to the Old
Testament saints who really responded to the Lord in Bible doctrine, those
believers that matured in the spiritual life. Our Lord’s possessions from the Church
Age will be resurrected saints at the Rapture of the Church. Exodus 19:5; Deut.
7:6; Deut. 14:2; Deut. 26:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;They will be Mine,&quot; says the LORD of hosts,
&quot;on the day that I prepare My own possession, and I will spare them as a
man spares his own son who serves him.&quot;” (Malachi 3:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“'Now then, if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My
covenant, then you shall be My own possession among all the peoples, for all
the earth is Mine;” (Exodus 19:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For you are a holy people to the LORD your God; the LORD
your God has chosen you to be a people for His own possession out of all the
peoples who are on the face of the earth.” (Deuteronomy 7:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;The LORD has today declared you to be His people, a
treasured possession, as He promised you, and that you should keep all His
commandments;” (Deuteronomy 26:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Malachi 3:17, “I will spare them” is the qal perfect
of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>חמל</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(châmal) and means
to have compassion on them as a man who has compassion on his own son who is
serving him because of love. For the believers who got with Bible doctrine in
420 BC, God had compassion on them. God's compassion is the expression of His grace!
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Malachi 3:18, “So you will again” refers to the Second
Advent of Jesus Christ. “Distinguish between the righteous and the wicked” means
to see, to observe the fulfillment of doctrine, to see the separation between
those who have God's absolute righteousness (+R) and those who have only human
relative righteousness (-R). Why is it so difficult to discern between the
righteous and wicked? Because many believers are all fouled up with religion.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So you will again distinguish between the righteous and the
wicked, between one who serves God and one who does not serve Him.” (Malachi
3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Conclusion of Malachi – Malachi 4 </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Judgment of the Baptism of the Second Advent</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Malachi 4:1, “the day is coming” refers to the
judgment of the unbelievers at His Second Advent with blood up to the horses’
bridles, etc. “Burning like a furnace” is the qal active participle of <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>בָּעַר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(baar) and means a continuous fierce
burning. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For behold, the day is coming, burning like a furnace;
and all the arrogant and every evildoer will be chaff; and the day that is
coming will set them ablaze,&quot; says the LORD of hosts, &quot;so that it
will leave them neither root nor branch.&quot;” (Malachi 4:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are seven major judgments in the Word; 1) judgment
of Jesus Christ for our sins on the Cross, 2) the believer’s self-judgment, 3)
judgment of believers’ human good at the Judgment Seat of Christ, 4) judgment
of living Tribulation unbelieving Jews, 5) judgment of living Tribulation unbelieving
Gentiles, 6) judgment of Satan and all Fallen Angels, and 7) judgment of all
unbelievers. See the category on the <a href="#_D-Seven_Major_Judgments">Seven
Major Judgments</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Malachi 4:1, “the arrogant” are those who accept human
good for salvation, but it does not work out. “Every evildoer” are those who produce
sin, evil, and human good from their old sin nature. Their motivator is the
lust pattern. “Will be chaff” means they will burn as a prairie fire in the
Lake of Fire. “It will leave them neither root nor branch” means utter
destruction. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Malachi 4:2 is speaking of the believers in the
Tribulation. “Sun of righteousness” refers to Jesus Christ. “Will rise with
healing in its wings” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>מרפּא</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(marpê') and means
salvation, security, deliverance from the fifth cycle of discipline. The nation
will be restored. “You will go forth and skip about like calves from the stall”
refers to the believers’ entrance into the Millennium in their physical bodies.
This is an idiom for prosperity, spiritual and economic. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Many Jews have economic prosperity today. But they can’t
have spiritual prosperity as a nation today because they are under the 5th
fifth cycle of discipline – the Diaspora. The only way they can become
spiritually prosperous is to be saved by belief in Jesus Christ as their
Savior. Then they are no longer Jews, but members of the Church, the Body of
Christ. In the Church Age, there is no such thing as a “saved Jew.” In the
Church Age, there is neither Jew nor Gentile. Gal. 3:28.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But for you who fear My name, the sun of righteousness
will rise with healing in its wings; and you will go forth and skip about like
calves from the stall.” (Malachi 4:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor
free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ
Jesus.” (Galatians 3:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Malachi 4:2 isn’t a verse for the healing movement. If
Jesus Christ came to earth to heal the sick, He only healed about 1,000 out of
about 300 million. He was remiss then. The legitimate function of every
temporary spiritual gift has ceased in the first century AD. Such apostate
practices today detract from Bible doctrine. Tongues and healing detract from
Bible doctrine and deemphasize Bible doctrine in favor of ecstatics and
emotionalism.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Battle Victory of the Second Advent </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Malachi 4:3, “You shall tread down the wicked” refers
to Jewish believers who continue to resist the king of the North at the
beginning of the Armageddon campaign. “Tread down” is to trample grapes to
produce wine. There will be great success, a great victory. “For they shall be
ashes under the soles of your feet” again refers to the great victory. Our Lord
will turn a certain unwinnable war into terrific victory at His Second Advent. Zech.
14:1-4; Daniel 11:40-45.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You will tread down the wicked, for they will be ashes
under the soles of your feet on the day which I am preparing,&quot; says the
LORD of hosts.” (Malachi 4:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Behold, a day is coming for the LORD when the spoil taken from
you will be divided among you. For I will gather all the nations against
Jerusalem to battle, and the city will be captured, the houses plundered, the
women ravished and half of the city exiled, but the rest of the people will not
be cut off from the city. Then the LORD will go forth and fight against those
nations, as when He fights on a day of battle. In that day His feet will stand
on the Mount of Olives, which is in front of Jerusalem on the east; and the
Mount of Olives will be split in its middle from east to west by a very large
valley, so that half of the mountain will move toward the north and the other
half toward the south.” (Zechariah 14:1-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;At the end time the king of the South will collide with
him, and the king of the North will storm against him with chariots, with
horsemen and with many ships; and he will enter countries, overflow them and
pass through. &quot;He will also enter the Beautiful Land, and many countries
will fall; but these will be rescued out of his hand: Edom, Moab and the
foremost of the sons of Ammon. &quot;Then he will stretch out his hand against
other countries, and the land of Egypt will not escape. &quot;But he will gain
control over the hidden treasures of gold and silver and over all the precious
things of Egypt; and Libyans and Ethiopians will follow at his heels. &quot;But
rumors from the East and from the North will disturb him, and he will go forth
with great wrath to destroy and annihilate many. &quot;He will pitch the tents
of his royal pavilion between the seas and the beautiful Holy Mountain; yet he
will come to his end, and no one will help him.” (Daniel 11:40-45, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Heralds of the Second Advent </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A king must be announced always by his heralds. Our
Lord’s First Advent had two types of heralds, angelic and human. Our Lord’s
human herald at His First Advent was John the Baptist. Our Lord’s angelic
herald was Gabriel. Luke 1:16-17; Luke 1:13; Luke 1:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;And he will turn many of the sons of Israel back to the
Lord their God. &quot;It is he who will go as a forerunner before Him in the
spirit and power of Elijah, TO TURN THE HEARTS OF THE FATHERS BACK TO THE
CHILDREN, and the disobedient to the attitude of the righteous, so as to make
ready a people prepared for the Lord.&quot;” (Luke 1:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the angel said to him, &quot;Do not be afraid, Zacharias,
for your petition has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son,
and you will give him the name John.” (Luke 1:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The angel answered and said to him, &quot;I am Gabriel, who
stands in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to
bring you this good news.” (Luke 1:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The human heralds at His Second Advent will be from the
same nationality, Moses and Elijah. Mal. 4:4-5. Moses and Elijah will be the
two witnesses of Revelation 11. At our Lord’s transfiguration, Moses and Elijah
were there. Our Lord’s angelic herald will be the mighty angel of Revelation
10. Matt. 16:28 through Matt. 17:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Remember the law of Moses My servant, even the statutes
and ordinances which I commanded him in Horeb for all Israel. &quot;Behold, I
am going to send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and
terrible day of the LORD.” (Malachi 4:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>John the Baptist of the First Advent is not the Elijah of
the Second Advent. The same Holy Spirit that was in John the Baptist will be in
Elijah at the Second Advent. In John 1:21, “Are you Elijah?&quot; And he said,
&quot;I am not.” Jews got the First and Second Advent mixed up. Luke 1:16-17; Acts
3:21-22; Matt. 17:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“They asked him, &quot;What then? Are you Elijah?&quot; And he
said, &quot;I am not.&quot; &quot;Are you the Prophet?&quot; And he answered,
&quot;No.&quot;” (John 1:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;And he will turn many of the sons of Israel back to the
Lord their God. &quot;It is he who will go as a forerunner before Him in the
spirit and power of Elijah, TO TURN THE HEARTS OF THE FATHERS BACK TO THE
CHILDREN, and the disobedient to the attitude of the righteous, so as to make
ready a people prepared for the Lord.&quot;” (Luke 1:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“whom heaven must receive until the period of restoration of
all things about which God spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets from ancient
time. &quot;Moses said, 'THE LORD GOD WILL RAISE UP FOR YOU A PROPHET LIKE ME
FROM YOUR BRETHREN; TO HIM YOU SHALL GIVE HEED to everything He says to you.”
(Acts 3:21-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He answered and said, &quot;Elijah is coming and will
restore all things;” (Matthew 17:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Enoch will not be one of the witnesses because he was a
Gentile, therefore, he cannot be a herald. Witnesses (heralds) must be of the
same nationality. In Malachi 4:4, “Remember” means to learn it again. Bible
doctrine is the deliverer. If you forgot it, learn it again! Learn it and apply
it. There would be no more prophets after Malachi for 400 years. “Statutes and
ordinances” refers to the Mosaic Law. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Statutes” are Codex 1, the Ten Commandments, or the
Decalogue, the freedom code which makes clear that man is a sinner. “Ordinances”
are Codex 2, the spiritual code and presents the person and work of Christ.
Codex 3 is the Judgments, the establishment code or the national heritage of
Israel. This includes the entire political and functional heritage of the
nation Israel. This includes the Divine Institutions with emphasis on
Nationalism.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Elijah is presented in Malachi 4:5. Elijah will have a
ministry as a herald in the middle of the Tribulation. Elijah will have another
ministry in Malachi 4:6. “Great” refers to those going into the Millennium. “Terrible”
refers to those who are unbelievers and will die in the Baptism of Fire.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Evangelism Prior to the Second Advent </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Malachi 4:6, “He will restore the hearts” refers to the
Gospel message of Elijah that will cause many Jews to be converted. The fathers
will be saved and the children will be saved. The Gospel changes their attitude
toward Jesus Christ as their Savior. There won’t be the terrible family
breakdown during the Tribulation in those families where they become believers.
</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;He will restore the hearts of the fathers to their
children and the hearts of the children to their fathers, so that I will not
come and smite the land with a curse.&quot;” (Malachi 4:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Curse” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>חֵרֶם</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(cherem) and means a
curse which cannot be reversed. It is used here as the curse of death with no
backing out. The curse is non-redeemable and they will be wiped out. <i>Cherem</i>
refers to the unbeliever at the Second Advent. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The unbeliever is under a curse because they have
rejected Christ. They will have been evangelized by the 144,000 witnesses, by other
believers witnessing, by the two witnesses Moses and Elijah, and by angels. God
put the Canaanites under a curse or <i>cherem</i> and for this cause and the
Canaanites of Jericho were slain. The exception was Rahab the harlot. The Cross
is the only thing that can eliminate <i>cherem</i>. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Old Testament ends with a curse in Malachi 4:6. The
New Testament ends with a blessing in Revelation 22:21. The purpose of
evangelism in the Tribulation will be to avoid the curse, or <i>cherem</i>.
This will be the greatest period of evangelism in all of human history. </p>

<p class=Verses>“The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all. Amen.” (Revelation
22:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All who reject Christ as Savior during the Tribulation will
be under two curses. The first curse will be the Baptism of Fire which removes
them from the earth, they will not enter the Millennium, they will have no prosperity.
The second curse will be the Great White Throne Judgment where they will miss
the eternal state and end up in the Lake of Fire.</p>
