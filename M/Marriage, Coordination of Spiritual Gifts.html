<h2>Marriage, Coordination of Spiritual Gifts</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In marriage, the husband is the initiator and the head
and the wife is the responder. Thus, in the matter of Christian service or the
exercise of spiritual gifts, those had by the husband are the initiatory gifts
and the woman’s are those of the responder and reflector, like the gift of
helps. The gift of helps is a flexible gift which enables the woman the reflect
her husband’s spiritual gift. An illustration is provided of how two spiritual
gifts can function in a marriage and have a great spiritual impact. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Aquila and his wife lived in Rome until deported by
Claudius the Emperor and left a lucrative business. Aquila was a tentmaker and
had a tent factory in Corinth. Paul and Aquila had something in common, tent
making. They were fellow travelers. Acts 18:2-3; Acts. 18:18. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus,
having recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had
commanded all the Jews to leave Rome. He came to them, and because he was of
the same trade, he stayed with them and they were working, for by trade they
were tent-makers.&quot;  (Acts 18:2-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Paul, having remained many days longer, took leave of the
brethren and put out to sea for Syria, and with him were Priscilla and Aquila.
In Cenchrea he had his hair cut, for he was keeping a vow.&quot;  (Acts 18:18,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At Ephesus Aquila and Priscilla heard Apollos
ministering. Aquila and Priscilla heard him knowing that he did not have a
complete picture of the whole counsel of God. Aquila had the spiritual gift of
exhortation and Priscilla had the gift of helps. Obviously Aquila and Priscilla
were in agreement of what Bible doctrine needed to be communicated to Apollos.
This doctrine they had both learned from Paul.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now a Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, an
eloquent man, came to Ephesus; and he was mighty in the Scriptures. This man
had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he was
speaking and teaching accurately the things concerning Jesus, being acquainted
only with the baptism of John; and he began to speak out boldly in the
synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and
explained to him the way of God more accurately.&quot;  (Acts 18:24-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 16:3-4, “risked their own necks” is an idiom
which means to place under, to lay down, to risk their own lives. A man and
woman traveling team, without children, exercising their spiritual gifts.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Greet Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ
Jesus, who for my life risked their own necks, to whom not only do I give
thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles;&quot;  (Romans 16:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The church at Ephesus was started in the home of Aquila
and Priscilla. 1 Corinthians was written from Ephesus. In 1 Corinthians 16:19
and 2 Timothy 4:19, “greet” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>σπα</span>́<span
lang=EL>ζομαι</span> (aspazomai) in the Greek and means to salute one, to
greet, bid welcome, wish well to, to receive joyfully. They hosted a local church
in their house. Up to the last, Paul remembered this support team of Aquila and
Priscilla.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The churches of Asia greet you. Aquila and Prisca greet
you heartily in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.&quot;  (1
Corinthians 16:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the household of
Onesiphorus.&quot;  (2 Timothy 4:19, NASB)</p>
