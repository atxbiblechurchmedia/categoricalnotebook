<h2>Mental Attitude, The Believer’s Thinking</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer’s mental attitudes are reflected in what
they say and what they do. The Christian is commanded in Philippians 2:5 to
gain the thinking or attitude of Jesus Christ. Today Jesus Christ is absent. He
is seated at the right hand of the throne of God, but He left behind His
thinking, the written Bible, the inspired Word of God. 1 Cor. 2:16. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ
Jesus,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Philippians 2:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT
HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer is to be occupied in their thinking with the
person and Word of Christ. Heb. 12:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith,
who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has
sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 12:2,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A believer is what they think. This opens the whole realm
of mental attitudes. A believer’s whole outlook on life is dependent upon what they
think. Prov. 23:7; 2 Tim. 1:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For as he thinks within himself, so he is. He says to you, “Eat
and drink!” But his heart is not with you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 23:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of power
and love and discipline.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Timothy 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are two ways of thinking - divine viewpoint and
human viewpoint. Isaiah 55:7-9. In Romans 12:2, “by the renewing of your mind” refers
to thinking with divine viewpoint. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Let the wicked forsake his way And the unrighteous man his
thoughts; And let him return to the LORD, And He will have compassion on him,
And to our God, For He will abundantly pardon. “For My thoughts are not your
thoughts, Nor are your ways My ways,” declares the LORD. “For as the heavens
are higher than the earth, So are My ways higher than your ways And My thoughts
than your thoughts.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah 55:7-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by
the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that
which is good and acceptable and perfect.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 12:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You need divine viewpoint to please the Lord. The only
source of divine viewpoint is the Bible. 1 Corinthians 2:16 tells us that the
Bible is the mind of Christ. Therefore, you must know the Word of God to know
His mind and apply it to realize His will. The Bible is a critic of the
thoughts and intents of the right lobe of the soul or heart. Heb. 4:12. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT
HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any
two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of
both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the
heart.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Mental Attitude of Grace and Forgiveness</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The most important mental attitude of one believer toward
another is that of grace. God treats the believer in grace. Grace means that we
do not earn or deserve this treatment. God treats you in grace because of His
character, because of who and what He is. Matt. 18:23-28. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For this reason the kingdom of heaven may be compared to
a king who wished to settle accounts with his slaves. &quot;When he had begun
to settle them, one who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him.
&quot;But since he did not have the means to repay, his lord commanded him to
be sold, along with his wife and children and all that he had, and repayment to
be made. &quot;So the slave fell to the ground and prostrated himself before
him, saying, 'Have patience with me and I will repay you everything.' &quot;And
the lord of that slave felt compassion and released him and forgave him the
debt. &quot;But that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed
him a hundred denarii; and he seized him and began to choke him, saying, 'Pay
back what you owe.'” (Matthew 18:23-28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Grace thinking is divine viewpoint from Bible doctrine in
the soul and leads to grace action. When someone wrongs you, you should forgive
as Christ forgave. Col. 3:13; Luke 23:34. </p>

<p class=Verses>“bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, whoever
has a complaint against anyone; just as the Lord forgave you, so also should
you.” (Colossians 3:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But Jesus was saying, &quot;Father, forgive them; for they do
not know what they are doing.&quot; And they cast lots, dividing up His
garments among themselves.” (Luke 23:34, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You are to put problems and situations in the Lord’s
hands. No retaliation. Forget it and move on. Psalms 55:22; 1 Peter 5:7; Rom.
12:9; Phil. 3:13. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Cast your burden upon the LORD and He will sustain you; He
will never allow the righteous to be shaken.” (Psalms 55:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“casting all your anxiety on Him, because He cares for you.” (1
Peter 5:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil; cling to
what is good.” (Romans 12:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it
yet; but one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to
what lies ahead,” (Philippians 3:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When another believer hates you, you are to keep on
thinking Bible doctrine – divine viewpoint. They have the same position in
Christ that you have. They are subject to the same divine discipline that you
are and God knows perfectly when to administer divine discipline and to what
degree. He does not need your help. If you interfere, you are subject to triple
compound divine discipline. Matt. 7:1-3. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Do not judge so that you will not be judged. &quot;For
in the way you judge, you will be judged; and by your standard of measure, it
will be measured to you. &quot;Why do you look at the speck that is in your
brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye?” (Matthew
7:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You are to treat people in grace because of who and what
you are and you should be thinking grace. You don’t treat them on the basis of
their actions, but you treat them on the basis of what you think, what is in
your soul, not on the basis of what they think. You are in control of the
situation when you think divine viewpoint, but you are out of control when you
get down on the mental attitude sin level - their level. See category on <a
href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/F/Forgiveness.html">Forgiveness</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Believer’s Thinking Patterns </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All believers, more or less, have trouble with their thinking.
A believer may be able to control overt activities and look fairly good
outwardly, but be completely shot through with human viewpoint thinking. A
believer can be bothered greatly by the horrible things they think, yet
outwardly, they may appear to be a very wholesome character. 2 Corinthians 10
answers many of the problems of a believer’s thinking patterns. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is a mental attitude message in which Paul responds
to criticism. Paul was one of the most criticized people who ever lived. He
made a wonderful patsy because he travelled and knew so many people. The
criticism of the legalistic Judaizers gained so much ground that they were
believing their criticism in Corinth. When Paul was in Corinth, he spoke like a
mouse. When he was away, he roared like a lion in his written epistles
(letters).</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Meekness is not weakness, being a doormat to people, or
being sweet and gentle. If someone comes into the local church to straighten
out the pastor-teacher, that pastor-teacher may grab him by the arm or shirt
sleeve and say, “Stop it!” And maybe he says, “Well, I thought ministers were
supposed to be meek.” Being meek is having a grace mental attitude. Everyone
seems to think of a minister as a doormat. Meek means a gracious mental
attitude and it doesn’t come without Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 10:1, Paul is in fellowship and he has
the mental attitude of “meekness and gentleness.” This is the attitude of
grace. Paul begins by quoting his critics, the ones who maligned him. They were
calling him “two-faced” or in plain language, a hypocrite.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now I, Paul, myself urge you by the meekness and gentleness of
Christ—I who am meek when face to face with you, but bold toward you when
absent!” (2 Corinthians 10:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 10:2, Paul is saying, “I’m the same when
away as present and I can get tough in either element if I have too.” Paul was
criticized for being dogmatic. People were saying he was carnal. However,
dogmatism while teaching the Word of God is legitimate and not carnality. </p>

<p class=Verses>“I ask that when I am present I need not be bold with the
confidence with which I propose to be courageous against some, who regard us as
if we walked according to the flesh.” (2 Corinthians 10:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul got tough with the Corinthians who had said you
can’t be tough with people and be spiritual. They thought a spiritual believer
would just fold their hands and becomes a doormat and turn the other cheek.
Paul cleared up that misconception.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 10:3-4, Paul was telling them that the
believer is not meant to operate in the spiritual realm with our human
abilities and resources furnished at physical birth. Although we live in this
life, we do not war according to the standards of this life. We don’t solve
anything by violence or by negative mental attitudes. We are to operate using
God's grace resources and the enabling power of the Holy Spirit in our
spiritual life. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to
the flesh, for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but divinely
powerful for the destruction of fortresses.” (2 Corinthians 10:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We’re in a great spiritual battle and you can’t punch
Satan in the nose or shoot down demons with a 357 Magnum or even a 440 Magnum.
Our weapon is the “sword of the Spirit” which is the Word of God. Heb. 4:12;
Eph. 6:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any
two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of
both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the
heart.” (Hebrews 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And take THE HELMET OF SALVATION, and the sword of the Spirit,
which is the word of God.” (Ephesians 6:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You do not load your weapon until you put the Bible, the
mind of Christ, in the right lobe of your soul. How do you load your weapon!
Nothing is worse than an empty weapon. The most useless thing in the Christian
life is an empty soul with no <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in it!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The weapons of our warfare are spiritual. They are
promises, techniques, doctrines, and principles from the Word of God. If the
weather is bad, some people are depressed, irritable, miserable. If the weather
is fine, they say everything is great! Thus the weather dictates your thought
pattern. Good? No!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>How many of you are slaves to your emotional pattern? We
all have emotions, but since you discovered Bible doctrine, you should really
enjoy your emotions. We are not to let our emotions rule us. The weather
changes, but we don’t have to if we have the Word in our soul. When depressed,
does that have to rule us? Not at all!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Don’t let the circumstances of life dictate to you, let
the Holy Spirit control your life. Emotions will say to you that your situation
is rough, you should get disturbed, you should think about hitting the panic
button, punch your way out of it, get even, tell them off, be miserable, be
hysterical, or look at life from human viewpoint. Some say that no one is going
to tell them how to live my life or run my business. But yet circumstances run
you! </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 10:4, “fortresses” refers to systems of
evil thinking in Satan’s world system. They are the circumstances of life. We
must not be dominated by circumstances around us. We must dominate them.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Mental Attitude Victory</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 10:5, “destroying” is the present active
participle of <span lang=EL>καθαιρε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span><span lang=EL>
</span>(kathaireō) and comes from <span lang=EL>κατα</span>́ (kata)<i> </i>meaning
norm or standard and can also mean down plus <span lang=EL>αι</span>̓́<span
lang=EL>ρω</span> (airō) meaning to lift up. Therefore, it means to lift up
and tear down, to destroy. This word was used of military conquest and means to
assault and tear down an enemy fortification. The present active participle
reads every believer into the Angelic Conflict. Whether or not you know it as a
believer, you have been inducted in to the Angelic Conflict at the point of salvation.
</p>

<p class=Verses>“We are destroying speculations and every lofty thing raised up
against the knowledge of God, and we are taking every thought captive to the
obedience of Christ,” (2 Corinthians 10:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Kathaireō</i> is a word of offense and it tells us
immediately that during the Church Age, the devil is on the defense. Satan has
lost the offensive since the Cross. You are the assault troops to destroy the
Satanic fortifications. Apostate believers cannot do this and they are
fantastic liabilities. Apostates in the Angelic Conflict is like attacking a
reinforced seasoned army division with troops that are untrained, unmotivated,
unprotected, and unarmed. To be effective in the Angelic Conflict, it takes a
tremendous concentration of Bible doctrine in your soul. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Corinthians were neutralized by their carnality,
emotional revolt, and reversionism. We must use spiritual weapons in the
demolishing of Satanic systems of thought (doctrine of demons). </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 10:5, “speculations” is <span lang=EL>λογισμο</span>́<span
lang=EL>ς</span> (logismos) and means systems of thought or reasonings,
calculation, reflection, thoughts and sentiments that occupy the mind - human
viewpoint that is sin. This refers to assaulting and demolishing Satan’s world
systems of thought. This is Satan’s outer perimeter of defense. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Every lofty thing” is the accusative singular of <span
lang=EL>πα</span>͂<span lang=EL>ς</span> (pas) plus <span lang=EL>υ</span>̔́<span
lang=EL>ψωμα</span> (hupsōma) and means obstacles of pride. In your soul, you
have mental attitude sins and at the same time you produce human good. These
things exalt themselves against divine viewpoint - the knowledge of God. This
is the devil’s inner perimeter built up with obstacles of the mental attitude
sins of pride and human viewpoint. These are Satanic towers analogous to the
towers of ancient forts. Satan’s setting up a dual defense in the Angelic
Conflict of an inner perimeter and outer systems of defense is admission that
he is prepared for a desperate fight or a desperate situation.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan is desperate today. Our Lord’s strategic victory in
the Angelic Conflict resulting in His substitutionary spiritual death on the Cross
for all mankind has made Satan desperate. The victory of the Cross is the
resurrection, ascension, session of Jesus Christ today! Once Jesus Christ was
seated at the right hand of the throne of the Father, the devil has been on the
defensive. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some people say the devil is after them or the devil did
this or that. That implies that Satan is on the offensive and that he is
carrying the ball. He is not on the offensive. No one seems to realize it
because they don’t have enough Bible doctrine to know this.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 10:5, “raised up against” is the present
middle participle of <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>παι</span>́<span
lang=EL>ρω</span> (epairō) plus κατά (kata) and means to elevate, to assault,
to attack. Human viewpoint and Satan’s world system always stand on the inner
perimeter and are ready to counter-attack and remain always in opposition to
the “knowledge” or <span lang=EL>γνω</span>͂<span lang=EL>σις</span> (gnōsis) of
God which is divine viewpoint. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan will throw out a counter-attack from his defensive
position and when he does, he takes prisoners. Where does Satan attack Bible doctrine?
The word <i>gnosis</i> (knowledge) gives us the entire picture. <i>Gnosis</i>
is subject to counter-attack. Not so with <i>epignosis</i> or full knowledge in
the right lobe of the soul.  <i>Gnosis</i> is spiritually understood Bible doctrine
in the left lobe of the soul. It is learned and understood, but it cannot be
applied because it has not yet been believed. When the believer accepts <i>gnosis</i>
as God's truth, it is then transferred to the right lobe of the soul by the
Holy Spirit as <i>epignosis</i>. Only <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine is usable
in the spiritual life and only while filled with the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Taking” is the present active participle of <span
lang=EL>αι</span>̓<span lang=EL>χμαλωτι</span>́<span lang=EL>ζω</span>
(aichmalōtizō) and means to make a prisoner. In every generation, certain
believers become prisoners. “Every thought” is <span lang=EL>νο</span>́<span
lang=EL>ημα</span> (noēma) and means every system of thought, a thought that
is consolidated. Learning the knowledge of God makes human viewpoint a
prisoner. Divine viewpoint slaps down human viewpoint and makes it a prisoner. When
you have made a prisoner of every thought, you have staved off the
counterattack. <i>Noēma</i> is divine viewpoint. This is what happens when you
move away from human viewpoint thinking. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>How do you take every thought captive? Very simple -
study the Word, getting the Word into the right lobe of your soul. To have
one’s mind captivated by the knowledge of God, one’s thinking is captivated by
divine viewpoint. How? Stay in fellowship, learn Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 10:5, “to the obedience of Christ” is the
preposition <span lang=EL>ει</span>̓<span lang=EL>ς</span> (eis) plus <span
lang=EL>υ</span>̔<span lang=EL>πακοη</span>́ (hupakoē) and is a directional
preposition plus the word for authority. How does the believer “make a prisoner
of every system of thought toward the authority of the Christ?” Through learning
and applying Bible doctrine. How can a nation change their thinking? How can a
nation recover its standards? How can people change from one system to another?
The answer is Bible doctrine! </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A corrected translation of 2 Corinthians 10:5 is,
“Assaulting and demolishing Satanic systems of thoughts (outer perimeter) and
every obstacle of pride (inner perimeter indicating desperation) attacking
against the objective knowledge of the God (and even though there is a
counter-attack it is staved off) and making a prisoner of every human viewpoint
system of thought to the authority of Christ.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Philippians 4:11-12, contentment is a peace that is a
stabilized relaxed mental attitude. You learn contentment! Because Paul knew
Bible doctrine, he always had this inner contentment. We should not be slaves
of our inner circumstances, either great or dismal. Circumstances do not make
you! You as a believer make the circumstances. This is the power of divine
viewpoint.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Not that I speak from want, for I have learned to be content
in whatever circumstances I am. I know how to get along with humble means, and
I also know how to live in prosperity; in any and every circumstance I have
learned the secret of being filled and going hungry, both of having abundance
and suffering need.” (Philippians 4:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>A Garrison of the Soul</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There must be a garrison in your soul against the
instability of swallowing the human viewpoint of life. To build a garrison in
your soul, you must confess sin biblically and continue consistently with the
intake and application of the Word. Keep stockpiling <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine
in the right lobe of the soul. 1 John 1:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Forget your confessed sins and then isolate your sins and
operate without a guilt complex. Phil. 3:13; Heb. 12:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it
yet; but one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to
what lies ahead,” (Philippians 3:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“See to it that no one comes short of the grace of God; that no
root of bitterness springing up causes trouble, and by it many be defiled;”
(Hebrews 12:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You then need the consistent perception of the Word of
God. You won’t get much at the start, but keep at it. Avail yourself of categorical
teaching as much as possible so you can grow spiritually. 2 Tim. 2:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman
who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth.” (2
Timothy 2:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Then armed with Bible truth, the believer is to challenge
the human viewpoint of life. This can only be done when you are in fellowship
and stabilized by daily intake of Bible doctrine. The more complete your
edification complex, the more complete your challenge to human viewpoint. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 10:6, “and we are” is the present active
participle of <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓́<span lang=EL>χω</span> (echō) and means
to have and to hold. It refers to a way of life as indicated by the participle
- having and holding a guard mount. You must mount guard continually in your
soul. For example, every time a military organization stops, it must have
security. God has two securities - eternal security whereby you can’t lose your
salvation and temporal security which is the mounting of a spiritual guard
organization in your soul.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and we are ready to punish all disobedience, whenever your
obedience is complete.” (2 Corinthians 10:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Are ready” is <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>ν</span>
(en) plus the locative of <span lang=EL>ε</span>̔<span lang=EL>τοιμος</span>
(hetoimos) and means in the sphere of a guard mount. This is actually a
military term used to describe a garrison of troops grouped at a point to stop
revolution. Here it is used of the providing of a garrison in the soul to
prevent revolution in the soul. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>How can you have revolution in the soul? Negative
volition toward Bible doctrine which begins the buildup of scar tissue in your
soul, emotional revolt in your soul, reversionism of the soul, and general
apostacy or human viewpoint of the soul. That is it! This is revolution of the
soul!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are only two systems of defense against this. The
unbeliever’s defense is positive volition to the Gospel. The believer’s defense
is positive volition plus Bible doctrine. This is talking about the defense of
the believer’s soul. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Angelic Conflict, the primary battleground is the
soul. You will think human viewpoint when your soul is under revolt. You can
think divine viewpoint only when your soul is garrisoned and protected with the
filling of the Holy Spirit and applying <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The analogy between the changing of the guard and the grace
apparatus for perception is quite unique in that things must always be
observed. Your frame of reference is your primary sentry box or inner
perimeter. From there you move to an outer perimeter which is the vocabulary of
Bible doctrine, the norms and standards of Bible doctrine, the viewpoint of
Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every believer must do this or they will suffer
revolution of the soul. Revolution of the soul is worse than carnality. It is
the sum total of negative volition, scar tissue, emotional revolt, reversionism
and apostacy. If allowed to run long enough, it will end in the Sin Unto Death
where God will shorten the believer’s life on this earth and take them home
early. This is total take-over of the soul by demon doctrine, not demon
possession. Do not fear the one who can kill the body, but fear the one who can
control the soul. Matt. 10:28</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Do not fear those who kill the body but are unable to
kill the soul; but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in
hell.” (Matthew 10:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Revolution is always bad in the biblical sense. The old
sin nature is a Satanic force on the battlefield. However it can only tempt the
believer to produce in carnality, human good, and sin from their volition. In
carnality, the believer is motivated by the old sin nature lust patterns.
Satanic doctrine can come into the soul as an outside force and really foul
things up. 1 Tim. 4:1. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will
fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and doctrines
of demons,” (1 Timothy 4:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The protection against it is not witnessing, not prayer,
not doing your little good deeds, and not trying to turn Christianity into a
boy scout troop. The only protection is Bible doctrine which is the guard
mount! Bible doctrine is the garrison that protects the soul! </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 10:6, “to punish” is the aorist active
infinitive of <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>κδικε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(ekdikeō) and means to execute justice. Here, it connotes defense against
Satanic attack. “All disobedience” is <span lang=EL>παρακοη</span>́ (parakoē) which
is a deviation from authority or a deviation from obedience to authority.
Therefore, it describes emotional revolt or any other revolution of the soul.
Total revolt of the soul we call reversionism and overtly expresses itself in
apostacy. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Whenever” is <span lang=EL>ο</span>̔́<span lang=EL>ταν</span>
(hotan) in the Greek and means on the occasion of knowing doctrine and
functioning under the grace apparatus for perception. “Your obedience” is <span
lang=EL>υ</span>̔<span lang=EL>πακοη</span>́ (hupakoē) and means the daily
function of the grace apparatus for perception resulting in the edification
complex, which is the sign of a permanent spiritual garrison. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Is complete” is the aorist active subjunctive of <span
lang=EL>πληρόω</span> (pleroo) and means to fill up a deficiency. In this case,
it is a deficiency of Bible doctrine in the soul to garrison against Satanic
revolt. It also means to fully possess. God intends every believer to be fully
possessed by doctrine, which is the garrison that puts down emotional revolt
and human viewpoint thinking. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Pleroo</i> also means to fully influence. This is a
daily function of the grace apparatus for perception in establishing a garrison
in the soul. It means to fill with a certain quality. God fills the believer
with the top quality of divine viewpoint through the function of the grace
apparatus for perception. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The aorist tense is a constantive aorist and means to
take in the Word of God day by day. The passive voice indicates that the
subject receives the benefits, receives a garrison by taking in doctrine. The
believer receives a defense of their soul. Believers do not have the human ability
to defend their souls in the Angelic Conflict. Satan has unseen attacks and already
has his infiltrators working with your old sin nature, therefore there is no
human way we can resist. God has provided volition to garrison. Volition always
crops up because of the Angelic Conflict. Every time you take in more doctrine,
you build more soul fortifications!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>No matter how much you wish to please the Lord or do for
Him, you cannot do it without a garrison of the soul. The Christian life is
lived daily and every day you must make decisions for doctrine. That is the
passive voice. The subjunctive mood means this garrison of doctrine is
potential based on positive volition. Up until then, you fight with a sling
shot, or bows and arrows, or your fists. We call this faith-rest and the other grace
techniques which introduce you to the edification complex of the soul. Faith-rest
is a holding force until your soul can be garrisoned by Bible doctrine. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A corrected translation of 2 Corinthians 10:6 is, “And
holding in readiness (the garrison) to punish all deviation from obedience
(that’s revolt) when your obedience (deficiency of doctrine) has been filled so
as to fully influence you (your soul).”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Pleroo</i> is used at least six ways in Scripture. It
is used of Christ’s function under the grace apparatus of perception and His edification
complex of the soul erected in Luke 2:40. </p>

<p class=Verses>“The Child continued to grow and become strong, increasing in
wisdom; and the grace of God was upon Him.” (Luke 2:40, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Pleroo</i> is used of the function of the grace
apparatus of perception of the believer in the Church Age. Eph. 1:23; Eph. 3:19;
Eph. 4:10; Col. 1:9; 2 Cor. 10:6. </p>

<p class=Verses>“which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all.”
(Ephesians 1:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that
you may be filled up to all the fullness of God.” (Ephesians 3:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He who descended is Himself also He who ascended far above all
the heavens, so that He might fill all things.)” (Ephesians 4:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason also, since the day we heard of it, we have
not ceased to pray for you and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge
of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,” (Colossians 1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and we are ready to punish all disobedience, whenever your
obedience is complete.” (2 Corinthians 10:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Pleroo</i> is used of the control of the believer
under the Holy Spirit in Ephesians 5:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but
be filled with the Spirit,” (Ephesians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Pleroo</i> is used of the filling of the deficiency of
inner happiness in John 16:24, John 17:13, Philippians 2:2, and 1 John 1:4. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Until now you have asked for nothing in My name; ask and
you will receive, so that your joy may be made full.” (John 16:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But now I come to You; and these things I speak in the
world so that they may have My joy made full in themselves.” (John 17:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“make my joy complete by being of the same mind, maintaining
the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose.” (Philippians 2:2,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“These things we write, so that our joy may be made complete.”
(1 John 1:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Pleroo</i> is used of a pastor-teacher communicating
Bible doctrine to his congregation in Colossians 1:25. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Of this church I was made a minister according to the
stewardship from God bestowed on me for your benefit, so that I might fully
carry out the preaching of the word of God,” (Colossians 1:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Pleroo</i> is used of the production of divine good in
Philippians 1:11. See category on <a href="#_Fullness">Fullness</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“having been filled with the fruit of righteousness which comes
through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.” (Philippians 1:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Danger of No Garrison of the Soul</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Angelic Conflict is greater than we are! No one can
fight this conflict apart from Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the soul! No
matter how great you think you are! You cannot stand up under the pressures
that life brings. You will live to see personal and national tragedies. Will
you be ready for them? You need that garrison. Like salvation, the soul
garrison comes only by God's grace. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 10:7, Paul mentions his Corinthian
critics again. They look at the outward appearance which is human viewpoint,
but they should look at what is within the spiritual life which is divine
viewpoint. Only with divine viewpoint can you garrison your soul.</p>

<p class=Verses>“You are looking at things as they are outwardly. If anyone is
confident in himself that he is Christ’s, let him consider this again within
himself, that just as he is Christ’s, so also are we.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2
Corinthians 10:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“You are looking” in the Greek is the present active
indicative of <span lang=EL>βλέπω</span> (blepo) and means you keep on looking.
It is not a question, but a statement or reality. <i>Blepo</i> connotes that they
are all in the habit of a superficial glance. Why? They have no garrison of the
soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“At things” are circumstances, things, people and who
carries the big stick, who has the authority? They are in the habit of looking
at things according to a human viewpoint norm or standard. “Outwardly” in the
Greek is <span lang=EL>προ</span>́<span lang=EL>σωπον</span> (prosōpon) and
means superficial appearance or they are in the habit of looking at things
according to the standard of superficial appearance. That is the picture of a
soul without a garrison! A believer alive in the Church Age, but not having
doctrine, this is a soul overrun by scar tissue and worldly thinking, human
viewpoint thinking. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 10:7, “confident” is the perfect active
indicative of <span lang=EL>πει</span>́<span lang=EL>θω</span> (peithō). The
present tense of <i>peitho</i> means to trust or obey, but the perfect tense
means to have confidence. “Consider” is the present middle imperative <span
lang=EL>λογι</span>́<span lang=EL>ζομαι</span> (logizomai) and means they still
have eternal security, but they are in reversionism. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Just as he” in the Greek is <span lang=EL>καθω</span>́<span
lang=EL>ς</span> (kathōs) and sets up an analogy between Paul’s critics and
Paul himself. They can’t be straightened out with Bible doctrine because they
are in emotional revolt, so this is the way he hits them. He hits them with his
own authority. He has an edification complex, but not all people who have an
edification complex have the same rank or office. Not only am I once saved,
always saved, but I am over you! Paul says, “You are criticizing my authority,”
But he says, “I am over you.” He was going to hit them with his rank as Apostle!
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The literal translation of  2 Corinthians 10:7 is: “You
are in the habit of looking at things according to the standard of superficial
appearance, if anyone has confidence regarding himself that he belongs to
Christ, keep on thinking this to himself again that even as he is of Christ,
even so we!”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He has taken his first step in throwing his rank at them.
He hasn’t thrown it yet, but he will. He is in the same army. He is wearing the
same uniform they are wearing. What he is saying is that we are all one big
happy family, but I am in charge! And if we keep on being one big happy family,
I am going to keep on being in charge! </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The doctrinal principle is that all believers are in
union with Christ. Therefore, all believers are the objects of God the Father’s
love. Therefore criticism, maligning, and judging of other believers is not
only an infringement on their freedom and privacy, but totally incompatible
with Bible doctrine. Another major passage on that subject is Romans 14:4-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Who are you to judge the servant of another? To his own master
he stands or falls; and he will stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand.
One person regards one day above another, another regards every day alike. Each
person must be fully convinced in his own mind. He who observes the day,
observes it for the Lord, and he who eats, does so for the Lord, for he gives
thanks to God; and he who eats not, for the Lord he does not eat, and gives
thanks to God. For not one of us lives for himself, and not one dies for
himself; for if we live, we live for the Lord, or if we die, we die for the
Lord; therefore whether we live or die, we are the Lord’s. For to this end
Christ died and lived again, that He might be Lord both of the dead and of the
living. But you, why do you judge your brother? Or you again, why do you regard
your brother with contempt? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of
God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 14:4-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is both sin and violation of the priesthood of the
believer. They are criticizing Paul and running him down. In addition, Paul is
a communicator of doctrine. Those who teach Bible doctrine under a
communication gift have their authority from God. This gives him special
authority as with all pastor-teachers. Heb. 13:7; Heb. 13:17. </p>

<p class=Verses> “Remember those who led you, who spoke the word of God to you;
and considering the result of their conduct, imitate their faith.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews
13:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch over
your souls as those who will give an account. Let them do this with joy and not
with grief, for this would be unprofitable for you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 13:17,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Such criticism of Paul and nitpicking is a sign of no
garrison of the soul, a sign of total soul revolt, therefore a sign of
reversionism. Rejection of Paul’s authority is another sign of emotional revolt
of the soul. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Even though people criticize us, we can’t stop and
criticize back and fall apart. That is sin and an emotional reaction in
carnality with zero Bible doctrine application. There are many believers who
can’t take criticism. They can’t take the thought of being gossiped about. They
withdraw or fight back or become bitter. This emotional revolt of the soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul, as an apostle, had the authority to judge the
Corinthians, but the Corinthians, as believer priests, did not have the right
to judge or to evaluate Paul. His evaluation is from the Lord. 2 Cor. 10:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For even if I boast somewhat further about our authority,
which the Lord gave for building you up and not for destroying you, I will not
be put to shame,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Corinthians 10:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>2 Corinthians 10:8 introduces the right for a
pastor-teacher to judge his charges. “Boast” in the Greek is the aorist active
subjunctive of <span lang=EL>καυχα</span>́<span lang=EL>ομαι</span>
(kauchaomai) and means to glory in a good sense. For if I should boast/glory,
maybe I will, maybe I will not. “Our authority” indicates more than one or
anyone who has communicated with them. This would include Timothy and Titus.
They did not respond to Timothy’s authority or to Paul’s, but they did to
Titus’s authority. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul is referring to his authority and that of Timothy
and Titus. Paul now reminds his Corinthian critics of his authority. He throws
his rank at them. By using a third class condition, Paul makes a principle of
doctrine out of it. Paul was not ashamed of his authority any more than he was
ashamed of Jesus Christ or ashamed of the Holy Spirit who gave him his
spiritual gift. Paul’s critics wanted him to be ashamed of his authority so
that he would not use the big stick against them as he did in 1 Corinthians -
the first Corinthian epistle started all the trouble. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Emotional revolt and reversionism always reject the
authority of a pastor-teacher. The legalists at Corinth sought to destroy
Paul’s authority by making it appear as though he was bullying. Legalism must
lure believers from grace by attacking the authority of those who teach grace.
It is Paul who provided the guard mount for the soul. Therefore, Satan is
attacking the one who provides the guard mount. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For if they respond to Paul’s teaching again, they will
recover from reversionism and their souls will be guarded by doctrine.
Therefore, they also seek to discredit this authority by making it appear in a
bad light (bullying). However Paul’s authority in the writing of 1 Corinthians
in chewing them out is definitely from God. 1 Thess. 5:12.</p>

<p class=Verses> “But we request of you, brethren, that you appreciate those
who diligently labor among you, and have charge over you in the Lord and give
you instruction,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Thessalonians 5:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 10:8, “gave” is the aorist active
indicative of <span lang=EL>δι</span>́<span lang=EL>δωμι</span> (didōmi) in
the Greek and means this authority is from the Lord. The Lord has given it. No
man has earned or deserved this. “Destroying” is not destruction at all, but
refers to reversionism. Since we are believer-priests, we have for the first
time the freedom to live our lives as unto the Lord. But often we take this new
freedom or established freedom in our lives and we use it as a club against
authority. This is where reversionism moves in to the last part of 2
Corinthians 10:8. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If you reject the authority of your communicator of Bible
doctrine, it is inevitable that you will move into emotional revolt and
reversionism. Interestingly, the Word of God never commands you to have rapport
with the communicator of Bible doctrine, but you are commanded to recognize his
authority.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 10:9, Paul’s critics said his letters
terrified them. </p>

<p class=Verses>“for I do not wish to seem as if I would terrify you by my
letters.” (2 Corinthians 10:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 10:10, his critics say also that he is a
poor public speaker and has a very weak body. Rome in that day had two criteria
in judging a public speaker. He had to be a fantastic orator and have a
beautiful body. Paul had neither and depended not upon his looks or voice, but
Bible doctrine and his spiritual gift of Apostleship. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For they say, &quot;His letters are weighty and strong, but
his personal presence is unimpressive and his speech contemptible.&quot;” (2
Corinthians 10:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 10:11, Paul indicates that he was not
depending upon a beautiful appearance, but he does indicate that he was the
same absent or present. Enemies of the Gospel always try to belittle the
believer filled with the Holy Spirit. Paul had an effective ministry because he
pleased God and not men. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Let such a person consider this, that what we are in word by
letters when absent, such persons we are also in deed when present.” (2
Corinthians 10:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 10:12, this describes a mutual
admiration society where everyone pats each other on the back, obeying the
proper ground rules, and making the right “clucking” noises to be “in” with the
right crowd. This is a description of a bunch of carnal Christians out of fellowship
and not taking in doctrine daily.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For we are not bold to class or compare ourselves with some of
those who commend themselves; but when they measure themselves by themselves
and compare themselves with themselves, they are without understanding.” (2
Corinthians 10:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 10:13-15, Paul says, “We boast in the
Lord”, and says, “our message can help even you, if you’ll heed it, but
according to the measure of the rule.” This is another way of stating divine
viewpoint. Paul is saying that mentally, divine viewpoint is the standard.
Divine viewpoint results in outreach of the Gospel as well as spiritual growth
and development in the believer. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For we are not overextending ourselves, as if we did not reach
to you, for we were the first to come even as far as you in the gospel of
Christ; not boasting beyond our measure, that is, in other men's labors, but
with the hope that as your faith grows, we will be, within our sphere, enlarged
even more by you,” (2 Corinthians 10:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 10:16-17, divine viewpoint results in
increased missionary activity. Divine viewpoint results in glorifying Jesus
Christ in our thinking. </p>

<p class=Verses>“so as to preach the gospel even to the regions beyond you, and
not to boast in what has been accomplished in the sphere of another. But HE WHO
BOASTS IS TO BOAST IN THE LORD.” (2 Corinthians 10:16-17, NASB)</p>
