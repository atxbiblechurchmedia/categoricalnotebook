<h2><a name="_Man_1"></a>Man</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are two categories of man; regenerate man
(believers) and the natural man (unbelievers). </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Natural Man – The Unbeliever</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The natural man is dichotomous with a body (tabernacle,
house) and a soul which is directed towards man. The soul has the ability to
understand, perceive, and categorize human phenomena and human phenomena only. In
1 Corinthians 2:14, “a natural man” is a soulish man and has no apparatus to
process spiritual information.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of
God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because
they are spiritually appraised.” (1 Corinthians 2:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The soul has essence or character. The soul essence
includes self-consciousness which is awareness of the soul including awareness
of your own existence (sentient). The soul essence includes the mentality and
has a perceptive lobe and a conscience lobe. The mentality includes the
thinking part of the mind and the norms and standards of the mind. The soul
essence includes volition which is the decision maker of the soul. The soul
essence includes the emotions which are the appreciator of the soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The old sin nature is not a part of the soul essence, but
influences the soul as the distorter and frustrater of the soul. In Romans
5:12, “sin” refers to the old sin nature. Everyone in the human race is born
with an old sin nature received genetically from their father.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world,
and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned—”
(Romans 5:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The natural man has no human spirit which means all
humans are born spiritually dead with no relationship with God and no
fellowship with God. Eph. 2:1-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And you were dead in your trespasses and sins, in which you
formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince
of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of
disobedience. Among them we too all formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh,
indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children
of wrath, even as the rest. But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great
love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in our transgressions, made
us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved),” (Ephesians
2:1-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Regenerate Man – The Believer</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The regenerate man or the believer is trichotomous with a
body (tabernacle, house), a soul, and a human spirit. 1 Thess. 5:23. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you entirely; and
may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame at the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.” (1 Thessalonians 5:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer’s soul is directed toward God and man. The
believer’s self-consciousness makes them aware of their own existence as well
as their everlasting relationship with Jesus Christ. The soul’s mentality thinks
divine viewpoint when the believer is filled with the Holy Spirit based on the <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the soul. The soul’s volition knows God’s
will through the intake and application of Bible doctrine and decides whether to
follow through on the basis of it. The soul’s emotions appreciate the Word of
God and Jesus Christ. See category on <a href="#_D-The_Soul">The Soul</a>. See
category on <a href="#_Right_Lobe_Compartments">The Right Lobe of the Soul</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer’s old sin nature continues to influence and
distort the soul when they are out of fellowship or carnal. When filled with
the Holy Spirit, the old sin nature is frustrated and cannot control the soul.
When the believer sins, the old sin nature immediately takes control of the
soul.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer is given a human spirit at salvation
(Regeneration). Rom. 8:16; Col. 2:13; Eph. 2:1-5. </p>

<p class=Verses>“The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are
children of God,” (Romans 8:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“When you were dead in your transgressions and the
uncircumcision of your flesh, He made you alive together with Him, having
forgiven us all our transgressions,” (Colossians 2:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And you were dead in your trespasses and sins, in which you
formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince
of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of
disobedience. Among them we too all formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh,
indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children
of wrath, even as the rest. But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great
love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in our transgressions, made
us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved),” (Ephesians
2:1-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The human spirit allows the grace apparatus for
perception to function for the first time. The Holy Spirit teaches the
believer’s human spirit when they hear Bible doctrine communicated. The
resulting spiritual phenomena in the human spirit is transferred by the Holy
Spirit to the left lobe of the mentality of the soul as <i>gnosis</i> or
spiritually understood information. If the believer has positive volition
toward that spiritually understood information, the Holy Spirit then transfers
that <i>gnosis</i> to the right lobe of the soul as <i>epignosis</i> or full
knowledge. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is the only form of spiritual information that can
be applied to life’s situations. The Church Age believer’s body is indwelt by
the deity of Jesus Christ for fellowship and by God the Holy Spirit for the
enabling power to live the spiritual life. Rev. 3:20; John 14:20; John 14:17;
John 14:26. See category on the <a href="#_Grace_Apparatus_For">Grace Apparatus
for Perception</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“'Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears My
voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and will dine with him, and he
with Me.” (Revelation 3:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and
you in Me, and I in you.” (John 14:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“that is the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive,
because it does not see Him or know Him, but you know Him because He abides
with you and will be in you.” (John 14:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will
send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance
all that I said to you.” (John 14:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Man’s Soul Image or Pattern</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The soul of man is the real person. Man’s soul is made in
the “image of God.”  The soul of man is in the shadow image or pattern of the
divine essence of God, not the exact image. This “image” is an image in
principle – a shadow image. An exact image would be like an imprint on a coin
or a photograph. The pattern is immaterial. The soul is immaterial. The soul
can only be defined by its characteristics, just as the essence of God can only
be defined by its characteristics. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 1:26 is the statement of the plan. “Then God
said” refers to the Godhead and indicates the concept of essence. “Let Us” is
in the plural and also refers to the Trinity. “Make” is the qal imperfect of <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>עָשָׂה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(asah) and means to make something out of
something, a pattern and also indicates that man is the basis for the
perpetuation of the species. “In Our image” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>צלם</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(tselem) in the Hebrew and means shadow image. The soul
of man is the shadow image of God. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then God said, &quot;Let Us make man in Our image,
according to Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over
the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth, and over every
creeping thing that creeps on the earth.&quot;&quot;  (Genesis 1:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The essence of our souls is made up of self-consciousness,
mentality, volition, emotion, and the conscience. God’s perfect essence is
composed of the absolute characteristics of sovereignty, righteousness, justice,
love, eternal life, omniscience, omnipresence, omnipotence, immutability, and
veracity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“According to Our likeness” means a model or pattern. The
Trinity is the model or pattern. Each member of the Trinity has exactly the
same essence, but they are different personalities. Every member of the human
race has the same soul essence, but each have a different personality.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 1:27 is the execution of the plan dealing with
the mechanics. “God” is again <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>אלהים</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>('ĕlôhı̂ym) and
refers to the Trinity, Elohim. “God created” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>בָּרָא</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(bara) and means to create something out
of nothing. The soul of man is real, but it is immaterial and it is created out
of nothing. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“In His own image” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>צלם</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(tselem) and means a principle image, in the image or
essence of God, soul essence. “Him” refers to Adam. “Male and female” indicated
He gave man’s soul image a body. “He created them” means that both Adam and the
woman had a body. Even though the woman was taken from the rib of Adam, she
still had a soul. The woman would be renamed “Eve” after the Fall.</p>

<p class=Verses>“God created man in His own image, in the image of God He
created him; male and female He created them.” (Genesis 1:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 2:7, “the Lord God” refers to Jesus Christ who
is the actual Creator. “Formed” is the qal imperfect of <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>יצר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(yâtsar) and means to form or mold as a potter molds a
pot out of clay. Jesus Christ formed the body of man with all its functions
including the ability to perpetuate itself. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD God formed man of dust from the ground, and
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being.”
(Genesis 2:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 2:7, “of dust from the ground” refers to the
chemicals of the soil. “Breath of life” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>נשׁמה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(neshâmâh) actually “breath of lives” in
the Hebrew and means God breathed in soul and human spirit life into Adam. A
human spirit and soul life were imputed to the body upon the first breath. God
gave the soul and human spirit of man a tabernacle (a body) and made them male
and female. “And man became a living being” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>נפשׁ</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(nephesh) and means a living soul. Soul life was given
to the format soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In conclusion, an unborn baby does not have the “breath
of life.” There is only biological life in the womb. Life is received from God
the Father when He imputes soul life to the baby causing the baby to gasp for
air. This is the point of physical birth. A living soul is imputed by God the
Father to the baby at that time. The real life (soul life) does not come until
physical birth.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><a name="_D-Three_Categories_of"></a><b>Categories of Unsaved
Man </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are three categories of unsaved man: immortal,
moral self-righteous, and religious self-righteous. All categories of the human
race are guilty before God. All have sinned when Adam sinned and fall short of
the perfect absolute righteousness of God (+R). Rom. 3:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of
God,&quot;  (Romans 3:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All are behind the barrier due to their spiritual death. All
are condemned under the concept of absolute good and evil. In John 5:28-29, “did
the good deeds” means accepting Christ as Savior and “committed the evil deeds”
means doing the evil of rejecting the work of Jesus Christ on the Cross for all
mankind.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in
which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice, and will come forth; those
who did the good deeds to a resurrection of life, those who committed the evil
deeds to a resurrection of judgment. &quot;  (John 5:28-29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is absolute righteousness (+R). Man has only relative
righteousness (-R). God can only have a relationship with perfect +R. Provision
for acceptability in God’s sight (+R) was made by Jesus Christ at the Cross.
God’s +R and justice were satisfied. Therefore, God's very own absolute
righteousness (+R) is imputed to man at salvation. Psalms 145:17; 2 Cor. 5:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD is righteous in all His ways And kind in all His
deeds.” (Psalms 145:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so
that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.&quot;  (2 Corinthians
5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Immoral Man</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Immoral man is unsaved. He is the overt sinner whose sins
are obvious. He is the bad man on which the moral self-righteous man and
religious self-righteous man sharpen their egos. The immoral man is the man
everyone condemns and looks down upon. The immoral man paints the town red,
admits he lives such a life and doesn’t really care who knows about it. Romans
1 shows him to be abandoned to the whims and depravity of his old sin nature. Rom.
1:21-32.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as
God or give thanks, but they became futile in their speculations, and their
foolish heart was darkened. Professing to be wise, they became fools, and
exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of
corruptible man and of birds and four-footed animals and crawling
creatures.&quot;  (Romans 1:21-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped
and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.”
(Romans 1:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any
longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do those things which are not
proper,” (Romans 1:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and although they know the ordinance of God, that those who
practice such things are worthy of death, they not only do the same, but also
give hearty approval to those who practice them.” (Romans 1:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Moral Self-Righteous Man</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The moral self-righteous man is also unsaved. The moral
self-righteous man is described in Romans 2:1-16. He is more confident,
worships the god of nature often, is a good citizen type, a good fellow, the
type the world likes to have around. He feels he is as good as any church goer,
but rarely attends church. Church is for children and grandmas who need a crutch
to lean on. The rich young ruler in Matthew 19 is an example of this type.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But do you suppose this, O man, when you pass judgment on
those who practice such things and do the same yourself, that you will escape
the judgment of God? Or do you think lightly of the riches of His kindness and
tolerance and patience, not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to
repentance? But because of your stubbornness and unrepentant heart you are
storing up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath and revelation of the
righteous judgment of God,&quot;  (Romans 2:3-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And Jesus said to His disciples, &quot;Truly I say to
you, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. &quot;Again I
say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than
for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.&quot; &quot;  (Matthew 19:23-24,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Religious Self-Righteous Man</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The religious self-righteous man is also unsaved. The
religious self-righteous man is described in Romans 2:17-29. The religious man
has the self-righteousness of the moral man and in addition he observes certain
rituals of religion. The religious man regards himself as superior to all
others because he has done more in order to gain a relationship with God. This
is an illusion.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But if you bear the name &quot;Jew&quot; and rely upon the Law
and boast in God, and know His will and approve the things that are essential,
being instructed out of the Law,” (Romans 2:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“you, therefore, who teach another, do you not teach yourself?
You who preach that one shall not steal, do you steal? You who say that one
should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you
rob temples? You who boast in the Law, through your breaking the Law, do you
dishonor God?” (Romans 2:21-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is circumcision
that which is outward in the flesh. But he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and
circumcision is that which is of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter;
and his praise is not from men, but from God.” (Romans 2:28-29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The religious self-righteous man is active in church, he
talks about God, he is enthusiastic, he is always on the church calling
program, or raising funds. He prays a lot, talks up religion, he may give up
various items for Lent to gain points with God. He is full of self-sacrifice
and would be called a deeply religious man by his peers. Nicodemus in John 3 is
a type of the religious self-righteous man. The following is a development of
the thinking of the religious self-righteous man who is up to the gills in his
ritual and do-goodism.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is a certain period of time that takes place every
year called Lent, the six weeks preceding Easter. Lent is a human tradition and
a very interesting human tradition, because at that particular time of year
some unsaved people become very religious. It is stimulating to their ego to
engage in some type of overt religious activity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For example, a religious self-righteous man may give up
something, something he probably enjoys the rest of the year very much. For
example, let’s take Charlie Brown. Charlie loves bubble gum and bon-bons. Since
he likes bon-bons better than bubblegum, he decides to impress God with giving
up bon-bons for Lent. Charlie Brown has a tremendous yearning and craving for
these rich, chocolate-covered bon-bons. So he decides to be a spiritual giant
and give them up.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This sacrifice makes him feel much closer to God and
makes him feel as if he has advanced spiritually, for a while his strivings
have not been in vain. In fact, some people feel way down deep during this
period that God is quite pleased with them and that the gates of heaven, those
pearly gates may be opening up just a little bit. Charlie feels after going
through six weeks without having had one rich, creamy bon-bon touch his tender
palate that perhaps he is, just now, just a little closer to heaven and a lot
closer to God. Maybe, just maybe, God will bless him in a business deal or some
circumstance. He may be on the verge of a great year. Who can tell? God helps
those who help themselves. After all he has done something for God! Charlie has
thought about God, he has attended church, he entered into some ritual, and he
has attained during this period a sense of human accomplishment. All in all, we
have a respectable package called the religious self-righteous man.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The purpose of the Mosaic Law is to show man he is a
sinner. Keeping the Mosaic Law does not save. The religious self-righteous man
says he is saved by keeping the Mosaic Law and yet he cannot keep it. They are
condemned by their own teaching. The religious broke the Mosaic Law. Rom.
2:21-23.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;you, therefore, who teach another, do you not teach
yourself? You who preach that one shall not steal, do you steal? You who say
that one should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor
idols, do you rob temples? You who boast in the Law, through your breaking the
Law, do you dishonor God?&quot;  (Romans 2:21-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The religious self-righteous man is guilty of teaching
others a way of salvation which he, himself, cannot execute. Religion is
inconsistent. The religious man observes rituals, but has no reality. Ritual
without reality is meaningless. Reality can be counted for the ritual, but the
ritual cannot be counted for the reality. Rom. 2:18-23.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and know His will and approve the things that are
essential, being instructed out of the Law, and are confident that you yourself
are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness, a corrector of
the foolish, a teacher of the immature, having in the Law the embodiment of
knowledge and of the truth, you, therefore, who teach another, do you not teach
yourself? You who preach that one shall not steal, do you steal? You who say
that one should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor
idols, do you rob temples? You who boast in the Law, through your breaking the
Law, do you dishonor God?&quot;  (Romans 2:18-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For example, the ritual of water baptism does not save
anyone. The reality of salvation by faith alone in Christ alone results in the Baptism
of the Holy Spirit resulting in union with Jesus Christ. Jesus condemned
religion and called the Scribes and Pharisees “whitewashed tombstones.” Every
self-righteous person has an area of hypocrisy. He puts a facade over
something, whitewashing it. Matt. 23:27.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For
you are like whitewashed tombs which on the outside appear beautiful, but
inside they are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness. &quot;  (Matthew
23:27, NASB)</p>
