<h2><a name="_Mental_Attitude"></a><a name="_D-Mental_Attitude"></a>Mental
Attitude</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A relaxed mental attitude in the Christian life is of
utmost important and becomes the key to actions of believers. The true
character of the believer is determined by their mental attitude.  Prov. 23:7;
Rom. 12:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For as he thinks within himself, so he is. He says to you,
&quot;Eat and drink!&quot; But his heart is not with you.” (Proverbs 23:7,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by
the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that
which is good and acceptable and perfect.” (Romans 12:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our mental attitude may not always be reflected in what
we say or do. We can often fool others, but we can never fool God. Heb. 4:13;
Prov. 21:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things
are open and laid bare to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.” (Hebrews
4:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Every man's way is right in his own eyes, But the LORD weighs
the hearts.” (Proverbs 21:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Christian life is a supernatural life and cannot he
lived apart from the filling of the Holy Spirit and application of Bible
doctrine resident in your soul. For believers, all changes must come from
within with the Holy Spirit being the origin of divine good and the old sin
nature being the origin of internal temptation to sin and do evil. Rom. 8:2;
Rom. 7:6; Gal. 5:25; Eph. 5:18; Eph. 3-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you
free from the law of sin and of death.” (Romans 8:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But now we have been released from the Law, having died to
that by which we were bound, so that we serve in newness of the Spirit and not
in oldness of the letter.” (Romans 7:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.”
(Galatians 5:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but
be filled with the Spirit,” (Ephesians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Unbelievers can have a change of mental attitude
(repentance) towards the person of the Lord Jesus Christ, exercise faith alone
in Christ alone for salvation, which results in regeneration (new birth). Acts
3:19; John 1:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Therefore repent and return, so that your sins may be
wiped away, in order that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the
Lord;” (Acts 3:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to
become children of God, even to those who believe in His name,” (John 1:12,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At salvation, God credited to our account His grace
resources to empower us to live in a manner acceptable to the Lord and to think
divine viewpoint which will bring honor to the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Eph.
5:8; Eph. 4:23; Col. 3:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“for you were formerly darkness, but now you are Light in the
Lord; walk as children of Light” (Ephesians 5:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind,”
(Ephesians 4:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Set your mind on the things above, not on the things that are
on earth.” (Colossians 3:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The choice to make use of God's grace resources is up to
the believer. The choice of our walk depends upon our volition. The power of
our walk depends upon the Holy Spirit and knowledge of <i>epignosis</i> Bible
doctrine in our soul. The mind of Christ (divine viewpoint) is laid bare in the
Bible and through study, knowledge and application of Bible doctrine, the
believer’s mind is renewed to prove and act in accordance with the Word of God.
The Bible is the mind of Christ and is said to be a critic of Christian
thought! 1 Cor. 2:16; Rom. 12:2; Heb. 4:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT
HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.” (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by
the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that
which is good and acceptable and perfect.” (Romans 12:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any
two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of
both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the
heart.” (Hebrews 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are two systems of thought - divine viewpoint and
human viewpoint. This is the battleground for the Angelic Conflict. You are
either thinking about what the Bible says or you are thinking from the
standpoint of humanity. There are so many things that can ruin you as a
Christian simply by what you think! Every thought in life is either one of
divine viewpoint or human viewpoint. Isaiah 55:8-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For My thoughts are not your thoughts, Nor are your ways
My ways,&quot; declares the LORD. &quot;For as the heavens are higher than the
earth, So are My ways higher than your ways And My thoughts than your
thoughts.” (Isaiah 55:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Conflict in The Frontal Lobe</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual growth is the mandate of God for every
believer. To accomplish this, the believer must seek the categorical teaching
of the Word of God whereby they can grow in grace and knowledge of our Lord
Jesus Christ. By doing so, the believer’s mental attitude and thinking are renewed
or transformed to be more and more like the thinking of Jesus Christ. 2 Peter
3:18; Rom. 6:3; Rom. 6:6; Rom. 6:9; Rom. 6:16; Rom. 12:2; 1 Cor 2:16. </p>

<p class=Verses>“but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory, both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.”
(2 Peter 3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into
Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?” (Romans 6:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“knowing this, that our old self was crucified with Him, in
order that our body of sin might be done away with, so that we would no longer
be slaves to sin;” (Romans 6:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, is
never to die again; death no longer is master over Him.” (Romans 6:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do you not know that when you present yourselves to someone as
slaves for obedience, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin
resulting in death, or of obedience resulting in righteousness?” (Romans 6:16,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by
the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that
which is good and acceptable and perfect.” (Romans 12:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT
HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.” (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Knowledge of Bible doctrine must be in the right lobe of
the soul before it can be applied. In Romans 6:11, “consider” means apply what
you know to experience. In this word, you have the application of divine
viewpoint to life. The more you look at life from divine viewpoint, the better
off you are! It is, however, impossible for the believer to have divine
viewpoint apart from knowledge of Bible doctrine and the filling of the Holy
Spirit.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Even so consider yourselves to be dead to sin, but alive to
God in Christ Jesus.” (Romans 6:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The unbeliever usually thinks human viewpoint, but
occasionally lines up with divine viewpoint principles such as the Laws of
Divine Establishment and the Divine Institutions of freedom of volition,
marriage, family, and nationalism. However, the unbelievers’ mind is blinded from
spiritual things and cannot think divine viewpoint. 2 Cor. 4:4. </p>

<p class=Verses>“in whose case the god of this world has blinded the minds of
the unbelieving so that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory
of Christ, who is the image of God.” (2 Corinthians 4:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer has a conflict of mental attitude – either divine
viewpoint or human viewpoint. Victory in the Christian way of life comes
through applying divine viewpoint based on <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in
the soul. Defeat is through applying human viewpoint. 1 Cor. 2:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of
God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because
they are spiritually appraised.” (1 Corinthians 2:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When a person is first saved, they begin their Christian
life as a babe. The tragedy in the spiritual life is when they never grow out
of the babe stage or revert back into it. 1 Peter 2:2; 1 John 2:12; 1 Cor.
3:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses> “like newborn babies, long for the pure milk of the word, so
that by it you may grow in respect to salvation,” (1 Peter 2:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“I am writing to you, little children, because your sins have
been forgiven you for His name's sake.” (1 John 2:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual men,
but as to men of flesh, as to infants in Christ. I gave you milk to drink, not
solid food; for you were not yet able to receive it. Indeed, even now you are
not yet able,” (1 Corinthians 3:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer then progresses spiritually to the adolescence
stage. 1 John 2:13; Heb. 6:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I am writing to you, fathers, because you know Him who has
been from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have
overcome the evil one. I have written to you, children, because you know the
Father.” (1 John 2:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore leaving the elementary teaching about the Christ,
let us press on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from
dead works and of faith toward God,” (Hebrews 6:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>From spiritual adolescence, the growing believer reaches spiritual
adulthood. Eph. 4:11-13; 1 John 2:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some
as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the
saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ; until
we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of
God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the
fullness of Christ.” (Ephesians 4:11-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“I have written to you, fathers, because you know Him who has
been from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are
strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one.”
(1 John 2:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An adult believer is one who has maximum <i>epignosis</i>
knowledge of the Word of God in the right lobe of their soul. They know the
Word. They have maximum divine wisdom and can apply it to experience. An adult
believer has maximum faith and mixes faith with the Word, believing and
trusting God. They have maximum grace with no illusions about self, but
understanding the essence of God. They have maximum divine good production.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Types of Mental Attitude </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer has a continual conflict of mental attitudes.
Character is a mental attitude, not what you are on the outside, but what you
think. You are what you think. Isaiah 55:7-9; Rom. 12:16; Prov. 23:7. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Let the wicked forsake his way And the unrighteous man his
thoughts; And let him return to the LORD, And He will have compassion on him,
And to our God, For He will abundantly pardon. &quot;For My thoughts are not
your thoughts, Nor are your ways My ways,&quot; declares the LORD. &quot;For as
the heavens are higher than the earth, So are My ways higher than your ways And
My thoughts than your thoughts.” (Isaiah 55:7-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Be of the same mind toward one another; do not be haughty in
mind, but associate with the lowly. Do not be wise in your own estimation.”
(Romans 12:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For as he thinks within himself, so he is. He says to you,
&quot;Eat and drink!&quot; But his heart is not with you.” (Proverbs 23:7,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has commanded a new mental attitude for the believer.
2 Tim. 1:7; Phil. 2:5; 2 Cor. 10:4-5. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of power
and love and discipline.” (2 Timothy 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ
Jesus,” (Philippians 2:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but
divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses. We are destroying
speculations and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God, and
we are taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ,” (2 Corinthians
10:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This new grace mental attitude brings confidence to the
believer’s thinking and outlook on life. 2 Cor. 5:1; 2 Cor. 5:6; 2 Cor. 5:8. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For we know that if the earthly tent which is our house is
torn down, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in
the heavens.” (2 Corinthians 5:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, being always of good courage, and knowing that
while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord—” (2 Corinthians
5:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“we are of good courage, I say, and prefer rather to be absent
from the body and to be at home with the Lord.” (2 Corinthians 5:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Love is a mental attitude of the soul. Therefore,
capacity for love is resolved in the soul rather than in the body. 1 Cor. 13:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“does not act unbecomingly; it does not seek its own, is not
provoked, does not take into account a wrong suffered,” (1 Corinthians 13:5,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Evil is something you think rather than something you do.
Matt. 9:4; Gal. 6:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, &quot;Why are you
thinking evil in your hearts?” (Matthew 9:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he
deceives himself.” (Galatians 6:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mental attitude sins produce self-induced misery. Prov.
15:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“A joyful heart makes a cheerful face, But when the heart is
sad, the spirit is broken.” (Proverbs 15:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Four Areas of Mental Attitude</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are four areas of mental attitude thinking –
worldliness, peace, giving, and stability. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Worldliness is a human viewpoint mental attitude rather
than an overt activity. Worldliness is something you think. Worldliness is not
overt, it’s a thought pattern. The only answer to mental attitude worldliness
is replacing human viewpoint (worldliness) with divine viewpoint. One can have
a beautiful outward life as did the Pharisees, yet be completely shot through
with human viewpoint. You can be sitting in church and be worldly depending on
what you are thinking. The use of cosmetics or the lack of them does not make
you worldly. It is what you think regarding them. Rom. 12:2; Col. 3:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed
by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is,
that which is good and acceptable and perfect.&quot;  (Romans 12:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Set your mind on the things above, not on the things that
are on earth.&quot;  (Colossians 3:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A good illustration is a very meek and mild person who
very quietly gets up, goes out and gets the morning paper without a sour look
at anyone. He is very relaxed with an angelic expression on his face. He reads
the morning paper and away he goes to work. He has no thought of the Lord, that
this is His day, that all things are going to work together for good, no
turning to the Word of God, no prayer. That angelic person is worldly because
of what he thinks. Whenever human viewpoint dominates your thinking, you are
worldly. You can be worldly sitting in church with a pious expression on your
face or folding your hands and never doing anything. Worldliness is what you
think, not what you do.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Peace is an inner mental attitude. Peace is not inviting
others to walk all over you. A relaxed mental attitude of peace enables one to
really enjoy the Christian walk regardless of other people or circumstances.
What do you do under pressure or when you get upset? Do you use divine
viewpoint, think it and apply it? You should be relaxed and have an inner soul
peace based on Bible doctrine resident in the right lobe of your soul. Just as
a good athlete is relaxed and calm before a competition, so should the believer
in the Angelic Conflict. Isaiah 26:3; Phil. 4:6-8.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;The steadfast of mind You will keep in perfect
peace, Because he trusts in You.&quot;  (Isaiah 26:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and
supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the
peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, will guard your hearts and
your minds in Christ Jesus. Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is
honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is
of good repute, if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise,
dwell on these things.&quot;  (Philippians 4:6-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Giving is a mental attitude and expresses the grace of
God. If the mental attitude is not right, don’t give. Don’t give under
pressure. Give with mental attitude joy. You can only have that when in
fellowship! What you think when you give is what counts. That is why we give. Don’t
feel obligated to toss in a buck when the offering plate goes by. 2 Cor. 9:7. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Each one must do just as he has purposed in his heart, not
grudgingly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.” (2 Corinthians
9:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Stability is a mental attitude. A good illustration of
this is Robert E. Lee, a believer, at the Battle of Gettysburg. Disaster report
after disaster report came to his headquarters, but he remained calm and had
stability under pressure. He kept thinking. Adults who are cry-babies or have
mental attitude fear are always unstable. Stability is the ability to think
under pressure. Deut. 6:5; Isaiah 26:3-4; 2 Tim. 1:7; 2 Tim. 2:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and
with all your soul and with all your might.” (Deuteronomy 6:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;The steadfast of mind You will keep in perfect peace,
Because he trusts in You. &quot;Trust in the LORD forever, For in GOD the LORD,
we have an everlasting Rock.” (Isaiah 26:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of power
and love and discipline.” (2 Timothy 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The things which you have heard from me in the presence of
many witnesses, entrust these to faithful men who will be able to teach others
also.” (2 Timothy 2:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>David and Goliath Example</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Samuel 17:8-10, Goliath had come out each day for 40
days to say ”I defy the ranks of Israel.” The camp of Israel had status quo
fear. They were scared out of their wits. Even Jonathan who had had a great
victory in 1 Samuel 14 was scared. Goliath was 9’2” and was a fearful foe. His
chest protector alone weighed 143 pounds. His spear had a head on it heavier
than a competition shot-put (16 pounds). David comes into the situation with
perfect inner peace and stability. Why? </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel and said to
them, &quot;Why do you come out to draw up in battle array? Am I not the
Philistine and you servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves and let him
come down to me. &quot;If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will
become your servants; but if I prevail against him and kill him, then you shall
become our servants and serve us.&quot; Again the Philistine said, &quot;I defy
the ranks of Israel this day; give me a man that we may fight
together.&quot;&quot;  (1 Samuel 17:8-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>David had courage and confidence in God’s promises in the
right lobe of his soul. He knew that the battle is the Lord’s. He had that
relaxed mental attitude that comes from knowing Bible doctrine. He had no
mental attitude fear when he ran to face Goliath and to kill him. 1 Sam.
17:46-47.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;This day the LORD will deliver you up into my
hands, and I will strike you down and remove your head from you. And I will
give the dead bodies of the army of the Philistines this day to the birds of
the sky and the wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may know that
there is a God in Israel, and that all this assembly may know that the LORD
does not deliver by sword or by spear; for the battle is the LORD'S and He will
give you into our hands.&quot;&quot;  (1 Samuel 17:46-47, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What is your fear? What do believers fear? It is fear of
death, fear of cancer, loss of job, loss of health, loss of loved ones and so
on? Your courage and confidence should be based on the Bible doctrine in your
soul. We should learn Bible doctrine and stockpile divine viewpoint in the
right lobes of our souls. Looking at life from divine viewpoint gives
tremendous stability and inner peace. The obstacles can be terrible and the
pressure great, but the believer has access to the mind of Christ which is the
Word of God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Divine Viewpoint vs Human Viewpoint </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Let’s investigate divine viewpoint and human viewpoint in
the area of respect for authority. This makes a fascinating biblical study in
that in America all types of authority are flaunted and children seem to have
little respect for authority. In the Angelic Conflict and during the course of
man’s history there has always been two mental attitudes in conflict. In each
of our souls is a battleground, a conflict between divine viewpoint and human
viewpoint. Isaiah 55:7-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Let the wicked forsake his way And the unrighteous man his
thoughts; And let him return to the LORD, And He will have compassion on him,
And to our God, For He will abundantly pardon. &quot;For My thoughts are not
your thoughts, Nor are your ways My ways,&quot; declares the LORD. &quot;For as
the heavens are higher than the earth, So are My ways higher than your ways And
My thoughts than your thoughts.” (Isaiah 55:7-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Human viewpoint will predominate apart from two types of
restraint – divine establishment and Bible doctrine. Divine establishment is a
type of divine viewpoint that can be produced by both the believer and the
unbeliever. However, Bible doctrine can only be understood and believed by the
believer. Bible doctrine believed is stored as <i>epignosis</i> or full
knowledge in the right lobe of the soul. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You are either a white hat or black hat in your thinking.
You are either thinking divine viewpoint or thinking human viewpoint. Just as
drug addiction can destroy the soul chemically, Satanic doctrine destroys the
soul spiritually. With this in mind, you really are what you think. Therefore,
mental attitude determines the life and character of the person. It is the
right lobe of the soul where the conflict exists. Prov. 23:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For as he thinks within himself, so he is. He says to
you, &quot;Eat and drink!&quot; But his heart is not with you.&quot;  (Proverbs
23:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You can have norms and standards in your soul that either
reflect God’s thinking (divine viewpoint) or man’s thinking controlled by the
devil’s world (human viewpoint). You can have a human viewpoint frame of
reference or a divine viewpoint frame of reference. You can have vocabulary,
human or divine. He can use Satan’s vocabulary and put together Satanic systems
of thought or you can put together categories of Bible doctrine in your soul. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divine viewpoint is commanded of the believer in 2 Corinthians
10:5 where “speculations” is  <span lang=EL>λογισμο</span>́<span lang=EL>ς</span>
(logismos) in the Greek and refers to Satanic systems of thought. In 2
Corinthians 6:7, “word” is <span lang=EL>λο</span>́<span lang=EL>γος</span>
(logos) and refers to the Word of God or Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=Verses>“We are destroying speculations and every lofty thing raised up
against the knowledge of God, and we are taking every thought captive to the
obedience of Christ,” (2 Corinthians 10:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“in the word of truth, in the power of God; by the weapons of
righteousness for the right hand and the left,” (2 Corinthians 6:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The mechanics of divine viewpoint depends upon the daily
function of the grace apparatus for perception. Since doctrine is called the
mind of Christ in 1 Corinthians 2:16, intake of Bible doctrine under the grace
apparatus for perception reshapes the mental attitude and fulfills the
principle of Philippians 2:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT
HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.” (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ
Jesus,” (Philippians 2:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s grace plan demands a new mental attitude on the
part of the believer priest. 2 Tim 1:7, Rom. 12:2. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of power
and love and discipline.” (2 Timothy 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by
the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that
which is good and acceptable and perfect.” (Romans 12:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Your thinking is reshaped into a sound mind, a stabilized
mind. In Romans 12:1, we are to confess our known sins and remain filled with
the Holy Spirit. In Romans 12:2, following recovery of the filling of the Holy
Spirit, we are to stop being conformed to the world in our thinking, but be
transformed by the renewing of our minds. Through the function of the grace
apparatus for perception, you may prove what the will of God is, namely that
the will of God is good, acceptable and perfect. The will of God is demonstrated
only by divine viewpoint. The inner happiness of the edification complex of the
soul produces capacity for divine viewpoint. Phil. 2:2. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to
present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is
your spiritual service of worship.” (Romans 12:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“make my joy complete by being of the same mind, maintaining
the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose.” (Philippians 2:2,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Part of divine viewpoint is that confidence which results
from the intake and application of Bible doctrine through the grace apparatus
for perception. 2 Cor. 5:1; 2 Cor. 6 - 2 Cor. 8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For we know that if the earthly tent which is our house is
torn down, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in
the heavens.” (2 Corinthians 5:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>True soul stability is a consistent divine viewpoint mental
attitude. Phil. 4:7; 2 Thess. 2:2.  See category on <a
href="#_Divine_Viewpoint_vs.">Divine Viewpoint vs. Human Viewpoint.</a></p>

<p class=Verses>“And the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, will
guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.” (Philippians 4:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“that you not be quickly shaken from your composure or be
disturbed either by a spirit or a message or a letter as if from us, to the
effect that the day of the Lord has come.” (2 Thessalonians 2:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Commands to Victory of the Mental Attitude</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A believer has either divine viewpoint or human
viewpoint. There is no gray area between them. They are absolutes because
divine viewpoint is an absolute. There is always a conflict of mental attitude
in the believer to either think divine viewpoint while in fellowship or to
think human viewpoint while in a state of carnality or being out of fellowship.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The unbeliever usually thinks human viewpoint, but they
occasionally line up with divine viewpoint principles, such as nationalism.
However, their mind is unable to think divine viewpoint. 1 Cor. 2:14; 2 Cor.
4:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of
God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because
they are spiritually appraised.” (1 Corinthians 2:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“in whose case the god of this world has blinded the minds of
the unbelieving so that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory
of Christ, who is the image of God.” (2 Corinthians 4:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A new mental attitude of divine viewpoint is commanded of
the believer by God. Col. 3:1-2; 2 Cor. 10:4-5; 1 Cor. 2:16. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore if you have been raised up with Christ, keep seeking
the things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your
mind on the things above, not on the things that are on earth.” (Colossians
3:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but
divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses. We are destroying
speculations and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God, and
we are taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ,” (2 Corinthians
10:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT
HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.” (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The swaying between two viewpoints in the Christian life
must be fought from within through confession of sin when necessary, knowledge
of Bible doctrine via the grace apparatus for perception, and the application
of <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine to life’s situations. 2 Tim. 2:15; Col. 4:5;
1 John 1:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman
who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth.” (2
Timothy 2:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Conduct yourselves with wisdom toward outsiders, making the
most of the opportunity.” (Colossians 4:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are commanded to let this mind be in you, which was
also in Christ Jesus. In order to know the mind of Christ, we need to learn and
apply Bible doctrine to our life. We are to have divine viewpoint or the Word
of God in our thinking. Phil. 2:5; 1 Cor. 2:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ
Jesus,” (Philippians 2:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT
HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.” (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All believers are in full time Christian service and God
expects all believers to reflect His viewpoint - divine viewpoint on earth. 2
Cor. 5:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were
making an appeal through us; we beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to
God.” (2 Corinthians 5:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Looking at life from divine viewpoint will give the
believer victory, peace, power and stability. Thus, they need to get Bible
doctrine into their soul through the grace apparatus for perception. All
changes in the Christian life come through the learning and believing of Bible
doctrine (<i>gnosis</i> to <i>epignosis</i>) in our souls thus renewing our
thinking and displacing human viewpoint with divine viewpoint as we grow
spiritually. Weapons at our command in this spiritual warfare are given in Ephesians
6:13-17. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i><span style='color:blue'>“Therefore, take up the full
armor of God, so that you will be able to resist in the evil day, and having
done everything, to stand firm. Stand firm therefore, HAVING GIRDED YOUR LOINS
WITH TRUTH, and HAVING PUT ON THE BREASTPLATE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS, and having shod
YOUR FEET WITH THE PREPARATION OF THE GOSPEL OF PEACE; in addition to all,
taking up the shield of faith with which you will be able to extinguish all the
flaming arrows of the evil one. And take THE HELMET OF SALVATION, and the sword
of the Spirit, which is the word of God.” (Ephesians 6:13-17, NASB)</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We have been given more commands. Prepare your minds for
action. Arm yourself with the same mind as the Lord Jesus Christ. 1 Peter 1:13;
1 Peter 4:1. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, prepare your minds for action, keep sober in
spirit, fix your hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the
revelation of Jesus Christ.” (1 Peter 1:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, since Christ has suffered in the flesh, arm
yourselves also with the same purpose, because he who has suffered in the flesh
has ceased from sin,” (1 Peter 4:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Consider what our Lord went through for us so that we
will not grow weary and lose heart. Heb. 12:3. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For consider Him who has endured such hostility by sinners
against Himself, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.” (Hebrews
12:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Have a mental attitude forgiveness just as Jesus Christ
forgave you. Have a mental attitude consideration of others. Eph. 4:32; Phil.
2:3-4</p>

<p class=Verses>“Be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other,
just as God in Christ also has forgiven you.” (Ephesians 4:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with
humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves; do not
merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of
others.” (Philippians 2:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All of these commands require the filling of the Holy
Spirit with daily function of the grace apparatus for perception and
application of <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine that forms divine wisdom in the
right lobe of the soul. This is thinking consistently divine viewpoint. </p>
