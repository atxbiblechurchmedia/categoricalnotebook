<h2>Marriage, Identifying the Right One For You</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pattern and precedent of one man for one woman was
established at the creation of man, that is Adam and one Eve - not two Eves or
five. A “godly offspring” comes only from the husband-wife relationship in
marriage. Gen. 2:21-25; Mal. 2:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and
he slept; then He took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh at that place.
The LORD God fashioned into a woman the rib which He had taken from the man,
and brought her to the man. The man said, &quot;This is now bone of my bones,
And flesh of my flesh; She shall be called Woman, Because she was taken out of
Man.&quot; For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother, and be
joined to his wife; and they shall become one flesh. And the man and his wife
were both naked and were not ashamed.” (Genesis 2:21-25, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>““But not one has done so who has a remnant of the Spirit. And
what did that one do while he was seeking a godly offspring? Take heed then to
your spirit, and let no one deal treacherously against the wife of your
youth.”  (Malachi 2:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the one man, one woman concept, God brought the woman
to the man. When a Christian woman or man conducts the “big search” instead of
trusting the Lord in guidance in marrying the right one, difficulty can result.
A Christian is to get his or her life partner on the basis of grace, not human
hustle and panic. Gen. 2:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD God fashioned into a woman the rib which He had taken
from the man, and brought her to the man.” (Genesis 2:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Relationship Stages</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are three stages of the relationship between a man
and a woman. They are attraction, compatibility, and rapport.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Attraction Stage</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Attraction is an interest or attention drawn to another
person because of their perceived  attractive qualities. Attraction between a
man and woman occurs prior to marriage and within the marriage. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Initially, the attraction is generally physical. The man
appreciates the woman’s outward beauty, her poise, her proportions, how she
dresses, her manners, her charm and wit, her sense of humor, her scent, her sex
appeal, etc. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The woman appreciates the man’s strong and good-looking
appearance, his chiseled features, his smart dress, his courteous gentlemanly
manner, his charm, his overt personality, his sense of humor, how he speaks to
her, the sense of protection she feels being around him, how he handles himself
around other men in her presence, his “scent,” his sex appeal, etc. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The attraction stage is dangerous because you are
thinking that what you have perceived early on is the real person. This is
rarely the case. You must investigate further to confirm the early perceptions
are indeed the real person or have become something different. You must
evaluate the person over time to properly discern their hidden flaws or
qualities. You must also analyze their attractive qualities to confirm they are
indeed long-term or “real” qualities. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Attraction is the blind stage where you often ignore or
are “blind” to the potential flaws in the one you are attracted to. You don’t
see the real person. For many, the sexual or sensual aspects of the man’s or
woman’s attractive qualities lead to early marriage on a wave of libido. This
does not usually end well. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>During the attraction stage, you have not yet discerned
any incompatibility that is a “show stopper.” For those incompatibilities that
you discovered, you have not confirmed that they can be resolved. Also, during
this stage, the problems the other person is dealing with or the “baggage” they
are carrying is not fully understood. Any of these can potentially cause the
end of the relationship. Remember, almost all relationships end during the
attraction stage. It is the exception to this rule that you are after. You
should be looking for the one you are willing to spend the rest of your life
with. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The attraction stage is a very subjective stage where
many conclude that the object of their love is the only one in the world for
them. People who get married in the attraction stage have very little chance of
success, but spiritual growth and God's grace enable the believer to overcome
this subjective decision. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The attraction stage is a test of the believer’s
stability and discernment. If the believer becomes too emotional without
thinking, any stability in the early relationship is lost. The strength of love
in the attraction stage is <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the soul and
consistent time filled with the Holy Spirit.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Compatibility Stage</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Compatibility is the ability to maintain a harmonious
relationship without problems or conflict because of well-matched
characteristics. Compatibility between a man and woman who are believers should
be motivated first by their personal love for God the Father and their unconditional
mental attitude <i>agapao</i> love for others motivated by the filling of the
Holy Spirit and application of <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in their souls. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The compatibility stage of the relationship is when both
the man and the woman are dealing with problems within their own spiritual life
and are making important mutual decisions. Both are taking responsibility for
their own decisions and actions. The middle of this stage is often the best
time to think about marriage.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are five characteristics of the compatibility stage;
spiritual, mental, physical, economic, and recreational. Spiritual
compatibility means that if you don’t agree on a particular essential doctrine,
you don’t agree on same pastor, or you don’t want to attend the same local
church, you will have trouble. This is the most important and also the most
difficult of the compatibilities on which to reach agreement.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Your will realize you have mental compatibility through
conversation. Physical compatibility is the easiest characteristic to confirm.
This is to be confirmed after marriage, not before. While exploring physical
compatibility (sex) is a learning process, it is also discovery and
pleasurable.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You both must confirm and agree on important aspects of
finances and how you both intend to handle them in economic compatibility. Recreational
compatibility in this stage is also fairly easy to confirm. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the compatibility stage, you learn the strengths and
weaknesses of the one you love and have already resolved most of the known
issues or problems of the relationship.  In resolving those issues or problems,
your love did not diminish. Ideally, the process revealed more about each other
and how each handled the resolution of the issues or problems. The love
relationship likely grew and became more stable due to the level of spiritual
maturity and demonstration of the application of Bible doctrine. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If the relationship has unresolved issues where the
attraction of either the man or woman is turning into disillusionment, they
must both work to resolve the issue or problem. Without resolution, the issue
or problem can end the relationship. It is important to identify these
potential issues or problems before marriage because once married, dissolving
the marriage without a biblical reason puts you out of the directive will of
God. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/D/Divorce%20%26%20Remarriage.html">Divorce &amp;
Remarriage</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The man and woman must both reach a mutual compatibility
before marriage, not after marriage.  Do not get married in the attraction
stage. Compatibility is the stage of reaching an unconditional mental attitude <i>agapao</i>
love for each other to stabilize the personal love felt in the attraction
stage. The strength of the personal love is <i>agapao</i> love, which is only
produced while filled with the Holy Spirit and applying the <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine in your soul. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Rapport Stage</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Rapport Stage is the harmonious stage, the maturing
stage. This where the man and woman understand the feelings, thoughts, and
attitudes of each other. This where the man and woman gain more and more divine
wisdom from their consistent spiritual growth and problem solving. The two
begin to think in the same way.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In this stage, the husband and wife further strengthen
their unconditional <i>agapao</i> love for each other and also unconditional
love for all mankind. The motivation for this is their personal love for God
and all that He has provided in grace. They also develop a deep abiding
personal <i>phileo</i> love, friendship love, rapport love, a total soul love
for each other. In doing so, they fulfill God's mandates for marriage. Col.
3:18-19; Eph. 5:22; Eph. 5:25. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/KL/Love.html">Love</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.
Husbands, love your wives and do not be embittered against them.” (Colossians
3:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord.”
(Ephesians 5:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the
church and gave Himself up for her,” (Ephesians 5:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Determining the Right One to Marry</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Physical Attraction</u>  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>These are guidelines for both believers and unbelievers.
There will be a physical attraction for the right one. There also will be a
desire for sexual intercourse, but body contact beyond kissing, handholding,
and non-passionate embraces is satisfied by soul contact. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the believer, this is controlled by the Word of God,
the filling of the Holy Spirit, and the edification complex in the right lobe
of the soul. The physical side is also controlled by a respect for the opposite
number. Passages like Ezekiel 23 indicate that premarital sex destroys respect
and often turns to hatred.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The physical aspect is also controlled by the fact that
on a date, the male is to be the custodian or protector of the female’s soul
and body. If he is too dumb to know this, the girl needs to be prepared to
protect her body and soul as well. There are further safeguards against
premarital sex. Why all the safeguards? Because premarital or extramarital sex destroys
those involved and keeps them from the ultimate happiness that they could have
in a proper relationship that God intended in marriage. Prov. 6:32.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The one who commits adultery with a woman is lacking sense; He
who would destroy himself does it.” (Proverbs 6:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Word of God gives the woman stability. Divine wisdom
of Bible doctrine in your soul will be your stability. Isaiah 33:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He will be the stability of your times, A wealth of
salvation, wisdom and knowledge; The fear of the LORD is his treasure.” (Isaiah
33:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>On a date, the man is to be the custodian of his
partner’s soul and body. 1 Peter 2:25.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For you were continually straying like sheep, but now you have
returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls.” (1 Peter 2:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For the man, he needs to first grow spiritually before
dating. Form the Bible doctrine in his soul, he will then develop spiritual
discernment and true capacity to love. Prov. 4:8-9. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Prize her, and she will exalt you; She will honor you if
you embrace her. &quot;She will place on your head a garland of grace; She will
present you with a crown of beauty.&quot;” (Proverbs 4:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He needs to have accurate information concerning himself
and the opposite sex. Prov. 5:20; Prov. 6:24-32; Prov. 7:1-27; 1 Cor. 6:16-18;
Prov. 31.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For why should you, my son, be exhilarated with an adulteress
And embrace the bosom of a foreigner?” (Proverbs 5:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“To keep you from the evil woman, From the smooth tongue of the
adulteress. Do not desire her beauty in your heart, Nor let her capture you
with her eyelids.” (Proverbs 6:24-25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Say to wisdom, &quot;You are my sister,&quot; And call
understanding your intimate friend; That they may keep you from an adulteress,
From the foreigner who flatters with her words.” (Proverbs 7:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Or do you not know that the one who joins himself to a
prostitute is one body with her? For He says, &quot;THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE
FLESH.&quot; But the one who joins himself to the Lord is one spirit with Him.
Flee immorality. Every other sin that a man commits is outside the body, but
the immoral man sins against his own body.” (1 Corinthians 6:16-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He needs to have the right companionship. To do that, he
needs to stay away from the fast crowd, drinking parties, or those who promote violence
and robbery. Prov. 1:10-19. </p>

<p class=Verses>“If they say, &quot;Come with us, Let us lie in wait for blood,
Let us ambush the innocent without cause; Let us swallow them alive like Sheol,
Even whole, as those who go down to the pit; We will find all kinds of precious
wealth, We will fill our houses with spoil;” (Proverbs 1:11-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He needs to respect the privacy of the opposite number on
a date. He needs to not constantly bug her to make out with him. 1 Peter 4:3-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the time already past is sufficient for you to have
carried out the desire of the Gentiles, having pursued a course of sensuality,
lusts, drunkenness, carousing, drinking parties and abominable idolatries. In
all this, they are surprised that you do not run with them into the same
excesses of dissipation, and they malign you;” (1 Peter 4:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Characteristics of the fast crowd include “sensuality”
which means unbridled mental or sexual lust, excess, licentiousness,
lasciviousness, wantonness, outrageousness, shamelessness, insolence. “Lusts”
are desires to be stimulated emotionally. “Carousing, drinking parties” means
to party with a view to illicit sex. “Abominable idolatries” refers to sexual
religious worship.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The proper physical relationship in courtship between the
man and woman will take self-discipline, but when marriage comes, the wait will
be very well worth it. The goal is to arrive at the day of marriage without
emotional scars or scar tissue of the soul, a guilt complex, regrets or mental
image of past conquests, or comparison, or lack of respect, or frigidity, or
nymphomania.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>However, even in marrying the right person, you will have
trials in marriage, terrific trials. You will love him then you will hate him.
You will want him then you will despise him. You will want him to be happy then
you will want to hurt him. You will want to make him suffer, to squirm. You
will want to make him gloriously happy, but you will respect him. You may want
to walk out, but since you are married to your husband that you promised to
respect and to respond to, you seek to work things out. No matter what your
husband does or your wife does, it can’t put out the fire of love in your
relationship. Even unfaithfulness may not quench it! Song of Solomon 8:6-7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Put me like a seal over your heart, Like a seal on your
arm. For love is as strong as death, Jealousy is as severe as Sheol; Its
flashes are flashes of fire, The very flame of the LORD. &quot;Many waters
cannot quench love, Nor will rivers overflow it; If a man were to give all the
riches of his house for love, It would be utterly despised.&quot;” (Song of
Solomon 8:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When the male believer marries the right kind of woman,
he has received grace from the Lord. The right woman or right man is always
from the Lord. Prov. 18:22; Prov. 19:13-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He who finds a wife finds a good thing And obtains favor from
the LORD.”  (Proverbs 18:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“A foolish son is destruction to his father, And the
contentions of a wife are a constant dripping. House and wealth are an
inheritance from fathers, But a prudent wife is from the LORD.”  (Proverbs
19:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Faith Basis </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The faith basis is for babe or adolescent believers in
spiritual growth. Take it by faith that there is a right kind of man or right
kind of woman for you. Pray for the right one even though you do not yet know
who they are. You are to become the right kind of person that your opposite
number would wish to marry through claiming the promises of God and daily
function of the grace apparatus for perception that results in the renewing of
your thinking. Don’t conduct the big search. You’ll blow it! Rom. 12:2; Col.
3:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by
the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that
which is good and acceptable and perfect.” (Romans 12:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and have put on the new self who is being renewed to a true
knowledge according to the image of the One who created him—” (Colossians 3:10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The big search is prohibited for Christian women in
Genesis 2:22. This does not rule out dating. Remember that in dating someone
that you do not end up marrying, you are having companionship with someone
else’s future husband or wife, so protect their soul and body.  Do not violate
either!</p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD God fashioned into a woman the rib which He had taken
from the man, and brought her to the man.” (Genesis 2:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The big search is prohibited for Christian men who have
become divorced in 1 Corinthians 7:27.  “Do not seek a wife” means don’t hustle
it or get in a panic if the proper skirt doesn’t come along. Cool it and have a
love affair in the meantime with Bible doctrine. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be released. Are you
released from a wife? Do not seek a wife.” (1 Corinthians 7:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 4:6-8, the Word of God or divine wisdom is
personified as a woman. The application is dual - toward Bible doctrine in your
soul and toward women.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Do not forsake her, and she will guard you; Love her,
and she will watch over you. &quot;The beginning of wisdom is: Acquire wisdom;
And with all your acquiring, get understanding. &quot;Prize her, and she will
exalt you; She will honor you if you embrace her.” (Proverbs 4:6-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Make the whole operation a grace deal. The Lord will lead
you to your opposite number who is so wonderful, your thought-pattern will flip
out. You will realize that you don’t earn or deserve them. They are God’s grace
provision.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Develop an Edification Complex of the Soul</u> </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Single believers with a developed edification complex of
the soul have a distinct advantage over the new or “babe” believers in
identifying and then taking the time to recognize and discern the right kind of
opposite number for marriage. This spiritual discernment is vitally important.
1 Cor. 7:9. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But if they do not have self-control, let them marry; for it
is better to marry than to burn with passion.” (1 Corinthians 7:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The edification complex of the soul is the inner soul
structure that God the Holy Spirit builds using <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine
as the building material and only comes about through consistent daily intake
of Bible doctrine over several years. Application of Bible doctrine provides
the discernment necessary to recognize the right one or the right kind of
opposite number for you.  This is the surest method for the believer. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>No mistakes are ever made when believers have this soul
stability and discernment. You should avoid “the big search” as God will
provide the right one for you in His timing. Until that right one shows up,
focus on spiritual growth. You should be perfectly grace-oriented and relaxed
about finding the right one to marry.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A woman with an edification complex in her soul is the
most valuable gift in the world. Prov. 31:10-31.</p>

<p class=Verses>“An excellent wife, who can find? For her worth is far above
jewels. The heart of her husband trusts in her, And he will have no lack of
gain. She does him good and not evil All the days of her life.” (Proverbs
31:10-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“She opens her mouth in wisdom, And the teaching of kindness is
on her tongue. She looks well to the ways of her household, And does not eat
the bread of idleness. Her children rise up and bless her; Her husband also,
and he praises her, saying: &quot;Many daughters have done nobly, But you excel
them all.&quot;” (Proverbs 31:26-29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Soul Compatibility</u>  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Soul compatibility is primarily for unbelievers, but
believers can use some of these as guidelines. There is soul compatibility
between self-consciousness with awareness of each other. There is soul
compatibility between emotions. There is appreciation for each other. You enjoy
the same things and feel the same way. Prov. 3l:28-29. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Her children rise up and bless her; Her husband also, and he
praises her, saying: &quot;Many daughters have done nobly, But you excel them
all.&quot;” (Proverbs 31:28-29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is soul compatibility between mentalities who think
about each other. There is soul compatibility between volitions where there is
a blending of wills resulting in desire to do the same things. Prov. 31:11-12. </p>

<p class=Verses>“The heart of her husband trusts in her, And he will have no
lack of gain. She does him good and not evil All the days of her life.”
(Proverbs 31:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is soul compatibility between consciences. Here,
they are raised with the same norms and standards, the same background in
culture, creed, race, and so on. Prov. 31:25-26.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Strength and dignity are her clothing, And she smiles at the
future. She opens her mouth in wisdom, And the teaching of kindness is on her
tongue.” (Proverbs 31:25-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is soul compatibility in a good conversation about
Bible doctrine or in some area of common interest, in silence, in doing active
things that both enjoy, but staying away from production of scar tissue from
mental attitude sins or fornicating. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sometimes, there is soul compatibility of old sin natures
producing the same areas of human good or sin. They have the same areas of
asceticism or lasciviousness, the same pattern of likes and dislikes in their
old sin natures. There is also opposite soul compatibility. In some instances,
exact opposites may marry and have compatibility where the unifier is, of
course, Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Marriage to a Spiritually Mature Woman</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 31:10-12, the value to a husband is stated
for being married to a spiritually mature woman. Such a woman is a treasure
because of the stability, beauty, integrity, and inner beauty of her soul. </p>

<p class=Verses>“An excellent wife, who can find? For her worth is far above
jewels. The heart of her husband trusts in her, And he will have no lack of
gain. She does him good and not evil All the days of her life.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs
31:10-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>She is completely supportive of the marriage with an
optimistic view of the future. She has a grace attitude based on the Bible
doctrine in her soul. Prov. 31:22-27.</p>

<p class=Verses>“She makes coverings for herself; Her clothing is fine linen
and purple. Her husband is known in the gates, When he sits among the elders of
the land. She makes linen garments and sells them, And supplies belts to the
tradesmen. Strength and dignity are her clothing, And she smiles at the future.
She opens her mouth in wisdom, And the teaching of kindness is on her tongue.
She looks well to the ways of her household, And does not eat the bread of
idleness.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 31:22-27, NASB)<a name="_Marriage"></a></p>
