<h2><a name="_D-Murder"></a>Murder</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan has been a murderer from the beginning. This means
that the devil after his fall from grace was guilty of mental attitude sins. Murder
always involves two other mental attitude sins - jealousy and anger. John 8:44.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;You are of your father the devil, and you want to
do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does
not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him. Whenever he speaks a
lie, he speaks from his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies.
&quot;  (John 8:44, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The devil motivated Cain (an unbeliever) to murder his
brother Abel (a believer). The act was done with a sacrificial knife. 1 John
3:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“not as Cain, who was of the evil one and slew his brother. And
for what reason did he slay him? Because his deeds were evil, and his brother’s
were righteous.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 John 3:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Hatred, a mental attitude sin, was the motivation for the
first murder in the human race. Gen. 4:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but for Cain and for his offering He had no regard. So Cain
became very angry and his countenance fell.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis 4:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Murder is prohibited in the Word of God. Exodus 20:13;
Deut. 5:17; Matt. 5:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>““You shall not murder.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Exodus 20:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“‘You shall not murder.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Deuteronomy 5:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““You have heard that the ancients were told, ‘YOU SHALL NOT
COMMIT MURDER’ and ‘Whoever commits murder shall be liable to the court.’”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew
5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Capital punishment is the penalty for murder according to
Numbers 35:30-31. This has been true from the time of Genesis 9:6. Rom. 13:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“‘If anyone kills a person, the murderer shall be put to death
at the evidence of witnesses, but no person shall be put to death on the
testimony of one witness. ‘Moreover, you shall not take ransom for the life of
a murderer who is guilty of death, but he shall surely be put to death.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Numbers
35:30-31, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““Whoever sheds man’s blood, By man his blood shall be shed,
For in the image of God He made man.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis 9:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“for it is a minister of God to you for good. But if you do
what is evil, be afraid; for it does not bear the sword for nothing; for it is
a minister of God, an avenger who brings wrath on the one who practices evil.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
13:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Murder is one of the seven worst sins and the only sin in
the overt category. Prov. 6:16-19. </p>

<p class=Verses>“There are six things which the LORD hates, Yes, seven which
are an abomination to Him: Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, And hands that shed
innocent blood, A heart that devises wicked plans, Feet that run rapidly to
evil, A false witness who utters lies, And one who spreads strife among
brothers.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 6:16-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Both anger and hatred are considered to be mental murder.
Matt. 5:21-22; 1 John 3:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>““You have heard that the ancients were told, ‘YOU SHALL NOT
COMMIT MURDER’ and ‘Whoever commits murder shall be liable to the court.’ “But
I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be guilty before
the court; and whoever says to his brother, ‘You good-for-nothing,’ shall be
guilty before the supreme court; and whoever says, ‘You fool,’ shall be guilty
enough to go into the fiery hell.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 5:21-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“not as Cain, who was of the evil one and slew his brother. And
for what reason did he slay him? Because his deeds were evil, and his brother’s
were righteous.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 John 3:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A person can be a believer and commit murder. However,
every murderer does not have eternal life abiding in him. 1 Peter 4:15; 1 John
3:15. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Make sure that none of you suffers as a murderer, or thief, or
evildoer, or a troublesome meddler;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Peter 4:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer; and you know
that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 John 3:15,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>First degree murder (premediated) involves mental
attitude sins. Envy or jealousy precedes murder. Rom. 1:29; Gal. 5:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, greed,
evil; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice; they are gossips,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
1:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these, of
which I forewarn you, just as I have forewarned you, that those who practice
such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Galatians 5:21,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Murder is a crime. The approach of any nation to the fifth
cycle of discipline also has a rise in crime of this type. Jer. 4:31.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For I heard a cry as of a woman in labor, The anguish as of
one giving birth to her first child, The cry of the daughter of Zion gasping
for breath, Stretching out her hands, saying, “Ah, woe is me, for I faint
before murderers.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jeremiah 4:31, NASB)</p>
