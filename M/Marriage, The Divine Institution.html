<h2><a name="_D-Marriage,_The_Divine_1"></a>Marriage, The Divine Institution </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A divine institution is a law or principle developed by
God for the well-being and preservation of the human race and designed
primarily for law and order and to keep the human race from destroying itself. The
four divine institutions are; volition, marriage, family, and nationalism. See
category on <a href="#_Divine_Institutions">Divine Institutions</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The divine institution of marriage is the most basic and
fundamental organization in the human race. Marriage is also a basic
organization in any nation. The divine institution of marriage began at the
creation of Adam and the woman in the Garden of Eden. The first marriage
involved two perfect human beings – one man and one woman in perfect
environment. Following their disobedience to God's single prohibition – the
Fall, God has ordained the divine institution of marriage for both believers
and unbelievers in every dispensation of human history.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The sin of Adam and the woman in the Garden of Eden
changed the divine institution of marriage. Before the Fall, the purpose of sex
was for recreation only. After the Fall of Adam and the woman and their
subsequent spiritual death, a second purpose was added to sex in marriage -
procreation for the perpetuation of the human race.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has ordained marriage to be a man-woman relationship
since the first marriage. The deity of Jesus Christ performed the first
marriage in the Garden of Eden when He brought to Adam the perfect woman for
Adam that He had constructed from Adam’s rib. Gen. 2:18; Gen. 2:22-23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD God said, &quot;It is not good for the man to be
alone; I will make him a helper suitable for him.&quot;” (Genesis 2:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD God fashioned into a woman the rib which He had taken
from the man, and brought her to the man. The man said, &quot;This is now bone
of my bones, And flesh of my flesh; She shall be called Woman, Because she was
taken out of Man.&quot;” (Genesis 2:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first marriage of the human race continued after the Fall.
The divine institution of marriage has never been cancelled by God in any
generation. Marriage has always been a permanent relationship between one man
and one woman. 1 Cor. 7:2-4; Eph. 5:22-23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But because of immoralities, each man is to have his own wife,
and each woman is to have her own husband. The husband must fulfill his duty to
his wife, and likewise also the wife to her husband. The wife does not have
authority over her own body, but the husband does; and likewise also the
husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does.” (1
Corinthians 7:2-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord. For
the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church,
He Himself being the Savior of the body.” (Ephesians 5:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The husband-wife relationship in marriage is the normal
and legitimate expression of soul rapport love and sexual love. Eph. 5:28; Eph.
5:33; 1 Cor. 7:9; Heb. 13:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own
bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself;” (Ephesians 5:28, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“Nevertheless, each individual among you also is to love his
own wife even as himself, and the wife must see to it that she respects her
husband.” (Ephesians 5:33, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But if they do not have self-control, let them marry; for it
is better to marry than to burn with passion.” (1 Corinthians 7:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Marriage is to be held in honor among all, and the marriage
bed is to be undefiled; for fornicators and adulterers God will judge.”
(Hebrews 13:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The husband is the leadership authority in marriage and
the head of the home. Marriage is for believers and unbelievers. If the divine
institution of marriage is violated on a widespread scale, a nation can be
destroyed. Gen. 3:16; Col. 3:18-19. </p>

<p class=Verses>“To the woman He said, “I will greatly multiply Your pain in
childbirth, In pain you will bring forth children; Yet your desire will be for
your husband, And he will rule over you.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis 3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.
Husbands, love your wives and do not be embittered against them.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Colossians
3:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Marriage is the basis for stability in society and for
the formation of civilization. It is the protection for the home where the
parents exercise authority over the children.</p>
