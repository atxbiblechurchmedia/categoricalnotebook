<h2>Spiritual Maturity Disorientation</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As you grow spiritually, occupational hazards develop.
Your goal is to mature by learning and believing a maximum amount of <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine from which your edification complex of the soul is constructed.
You don’t work for it, you receive it by grace as your thinking is renovated as
your thinking reflects more and more that of the Lord Jesus Christ. Rom. 12:2; 2
Cor. 4:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by
the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that
which is good and acceptable and perfect.” (Romans 12:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore we do not lose heart, but though our outer man is
decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day.” (2 Corinthians 4:16,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>However, when you mature spiritually you have not
arrived. You can still become a reversionistic believer through prolonged
negative volition to Bible doctrine. These are the very worst type of believers
– vicious and evil whose purpose has become to slime through life. They are
frozen souls with frozen faces. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The hazard the believer faces with their edification
complex of the soul constructed is the same that Paul faced in 2 Corinthians 12:7-10
when he received a “thorn in the flesh” that caused him to pray three times for
the ailment to be removed. God's answer was simple; “My grace is sufficient for
you, for power is perfected in weakness.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Disorientation to God's Grace</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul had an ailment of some kind that was causing some
serious pain and discomfort. 2 Cor. 12:7.  So intense was the pressure that for
a moment Paul was disoriented. He prayed for God to make it stop hurting. This
is disorientation to the grace of God. A literal translation of 2 Corinthians
12:7 is, “There was given to me a thorn in the flesh, an angel from the source
of that he might punch me, that I be not arrogant.” </p>

<p class=Verses>“Because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, for
this reason, to keep me from exalting myself, there was given me a thorn in the
flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me—to keep me from exalting myself!”  (2
Corinthians 12:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 12:8, “concerning this” is the
preposition <span lang=EL>υ</span>̔<span lang=EL>πε</span>́<span lang=EL>ρ</span>
(huper) plus the genitive of <span lang=EL>ου</span>̔͂<span lang=EL>τος</span>
(houtos) and is translated, on behalf of this. On behalf of the thorn in the
flesh. On behalf of the way he hurt. “I implored” is the aorist active
indicative of <span lang=EL>παρακαλε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (parakaleō)
and means from the immediate source of myself. The iterative aorist means this
is the beginning of the occurrence. On behalf of this, I began to beg. The
active voice means that Paul himself begins the action to temporarily sever the
grace concept. The indicative mood indicates the reality of the fact that Paul was
making strange noises like a baby. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Concerning this I implored the Lord three times that it might
leave me.”  (2 Corinthians 12:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Three times” means that three times in less than an hour.
Paul, a mature believer, was completely disoriented from the grace of God and
begged God. “That it might leave me” is <span lang=EL>ι</span>̔́<span lang=EL>να</span>
(hina) plus the subjunctive introducing a purpose clause with the aorist active
subjunctive of <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>φι</span>́<span lang=EL>στημι</span>
(aphistēmi) and means to shear off from or standoff from him. It means that it
might go now, but it’s going is potential. On behalf of this thorn in my flesh,
I began to beg the Lord three times that it might stand off from me. But after 2
Corinthians 12:8, Paul’s temporary disorientation ends.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Reorientation to God's Grace</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 12:9,  “And He has said to me” is the
perfect active indicative of <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>ρε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (ereō) and means to utter, speak, to say. The perfect tense
has past connotations with present results. Jesus Christ was not literally
speaking to Paul. Paul was now realizing that God’s answer to his prayers was
not to remove the suffering, but for him to apply the grace resources that he
already had in his soul and with the enabling power of the Holy Spirit to
handle the suffering. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And He has said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for
power is perfected in weakness.” Most gladly, therefore, I will rather boast
about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me.”  (2
Corinthians 12:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You don’t beg God to make it stop hurting! Why do you
think you have Bible doctrine? Suffering is brought to you so you will grow
spiritually and rely more and more on God’s grace resources that you already
have, but haven’t used them to the maximum. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“My grace” <span lang=EL>η</span>̔ <span lang=EL>χα</span>́<span
lang=EL>ρις</span><span lang=EL> </span><span lang=EL>μου</span>͂ (charis mou) is
the grace that belongs to the Lord Jesus Christ. This is the spiritual maturity
of the edification complex of the soul. Christ never turned back, never. When
Jesus Christ talks through Bible doctrine about His own personal grace, He is
talking about spiritual maturity! You do not live in spiritual maturity until
you have erected a completed edification complex of the soul. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Is sufficient” is the present active indicative of <span
lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>ρκε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span><span lang=EL> </span>(arkeō)
and is followed by a dative case. When the object of <i>arkeō</i> is in the
accusative case, it means “sufficient” but when the object of the verb is in
the dative case it means “contentment!” God's grace in spiritual maturity is
more than sufficient, it’s continual contentment! A literal translation is, “And
he had communicated to me, My grace produces contentment for you!” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 12:9, “For” is the illative use of <span
lang=EL>γα</span>́<span lang=EL>ρ</span> (gar) and means to express grounds or
a reason for the existence of God's grace available to the mature believer. Philippians
4:11-12 is another passage on God's grace available in spiritual maturity. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Not that I speak from want, for I have learned to be content
in whatever circumstances I am. I know how to get along with humble means, and
I also know how to live in prosperity; in any and every circumstance I have
learned the secret of being filled and going hungry, both of having abundance
and suffering need.” (Philippians 4:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 12:9, “power” is <span lang=EL>η</span><span
lang=EL> </span><span lang=EL>δυ</span>́<span lang=EL>ναμις</span> (dunamis)
and means the inherent power. God’s omnipotent power is available to meet the
needs of every believer. You must first develop the spiritual capacity to fully
use this power. “Is perfected” is the present passive indicative of τελέω
(teleō) and means to be completed, to carry out to maturity, to pay dues, to
fulfill. It never refers to perfection, except in the sense of Jesus Christ. The
passive voice means that it will limit whatever it is going to mean. Literally,
it means for the power of God is carried out or fulfilled and conveys the idea of
getting the maximum use of the power.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“In weakness” <span lang=EL>εν</span><span lang=EL> </span>(en)
plus the instrumental of <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>σθε</span>́<span
lang=EL>νεια</span> (astheneia) and means to be totally helpless by means of
weakness. Literally, “For the power of God is carried out or fulfilled by means
of helplessness.” You realize how weak the flesh is, the old sin nature, your
human ability, and your human talent. It’s no good! </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We now have a new sentence. How can you tell? Whenever
you have two adverbs together, you have started something new. You have a
superlative adverb followed by a comparative adverb. This is strong - time to
shout and dance! “Most gladly” is the superlative adverb of <span lang=EL>η</span>̔<span
lang=EL>δε</span>́<span lang=EL>ως</span> (hēdeōs) and means gladly, with
pleasure. “Rather” is the comparative adverb of <span lang=EL>μα</span>͂<span
lang=EL>λλον</span> (mallon) and means with the greatest of pleasure or to a
higher degree I will boast. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The principle here is that when a believer reaches
spiritual maturity, they can feel they have arrived, so they may begin to
boast. However, there is only one person they should be boasting about and that
is the celebrityship of Jesus Christ. He is the only celebrity! </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 12:9, “I will rather boast” is the
future middle indicative of <span lang=EL>καυχα</span>́<span lang=EL>ομαι</span>
(kauchaomai) and means to boast, to exult, to rejoice. Spiritual maturity has a
place for boasting which honors the only true celebrity, Jesus Christ. “About
my weaknesses” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>σθε</span>́<span
lang=EL>νεια</span> (astheneia) and means in the sphere of my helplessness.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“So that the power of Christ” is <span lang=EL>δυ</span>́<span
lang=EL>ναμις</span> (dunamis) and is referring to the function of the divine
power able to be utilized by a spiritually mature believer! To properly use this
power of the Holy Spirit, the mature believer must have the capacity from the building
structure (edification complex) of <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in their
soul! </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“May dwell” is the aorist active subjunctive of <span
lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>πισκηνο</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(episkēnoō) and means to pitch a tent or habitation on, to take possession
of. It was used in a technical way for the Shekinah Glory dwelling in the Tabernacle.
The Shekinah Glory is the glory of the deity of Jesus Christ. It was a military
term as well and meant to quarter, to bivouac. Literally, that the power of the
Christ may be bivouacked on me. Why is Paul crying out when the Shekinah Glory
of Christ is quartered (indwelt) in the body of Paul as He is in all Church Age
believers! </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A corrected translation of 2 Corinthians 12:9 is, “And he
had communicated to me my grace  produces contentment for you. For the power of
God is carried out (fulfilled) by means of helplessness. With the greatest of
pleasure to a higher degree I will boast in the weaknesses that the power of
Christ may be bivouacked on me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Function of the Mature Spiritual Life </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 12:10, “Therefore” is <span lang=EL>διο</span>́
(dio) and is a compound that includes a Greek preposition plus a relative
pronoun. It comes to mean “because of which” and refers to the spiritual life
of the mature believer making maximum use of God's grace resources in times of
great adversity and pressure.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore I am well content with weaknesses, with insults,
with distresses, with persecutions, with difficulties, for Christ’s sake; for
when I am weak, then I am strong.”  (2 Corinthians 12:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“I am well content” is the present active indicative of <span
lang=EL>ευ</span>̓<span lang=EL>δοκε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span><span
lang=EL> </span>(eudokeō) and means well-pleased, to do willingly, content. This
is in contrast to praying, “Lord, please make stop it hurting me.” This is simply
thinking divine viewpoint in high pressure situations. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 12:10, “with weaknesses” is <span
lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>σθε</span>́<span lang=EL>νεια</span> (astheneia)
and means weaknesses. This is the stimulation of grace orientation in the spiritual
life where the believer is focused on who and what Jesus Christ is and not what
and what they are. “With insults” is <span lang=EL>υ</span>̔́<span lang=EL>βρις</span>
(hubris) and means to be a victim of arrogance, to be a victim of insolence, to
be insulted. This is maintaining a relaxed mental attitude in the face of insults
and slander that directly challenge your relaxed mental attitude.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“In distresses” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>ναγκη</span>́
(anagkē) and is referring to needs, to necessities in life, pressures. This is
the stimulation of the mastery of the details of life in the mature believer’s
spiritual life. “In persecutions” is <span lang=EL>διωγμο</span>́<span lang=EL>ς</span>
(diōgmos) and refers to persecutions especially from religion and legalism, non-doctrinal
types, and other less spiritually mature believers. This is the challenge of
the believer’s capacity for unconditional mental attitude <i>agapao</i> love in
the spiritual life. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 12:10, “with difficulties” is <span
lang=EL>στενοχωρι</span>́<span lang=EL>α</span> (stenochōria) and means in dire
calamity, extreme affliction, in anguish, in intense suffering! This is the challenge
of the mature believer’s inner happiness in the spiritual life! A translation
of 2 Corinthians 12:10 is, “Because of which (the spiritual life of the mature
believer) I take pleasure in weaknesses, in insults, in pressures from needs,
in persecutions, in anguishes on behalf of Christ.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“For when” is the conjunction of ὅταν (hotan) and should
say “on the occasion of when I am weak.” “I am weak” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span
lang=EL>σθενε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (astheneō) and means helpless, to
be feeble, deficient to meet anything in life. “Then” is <span lang=EL>το</span>́<span
lang=EL>τε</span> (tote) and means at that time and only that time. “I am
strong” is the present active indicative of <span lang=EL>δυνατο</span>́<span
lang=EL>ς</span> (dunatos) and means I keep on being strong. This is a word for
general dynamics. This power resides in the edification complex of the soul. The
translation of 2 Corinthians 12:10b is, “For on the occasion when I am helpless
at that time (and only at that time) I keep on being strong.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>2 Corinthians 12:10 expresses the spiritually mature believer
in the spiritual life. Therefore, Paul can boast under maximum pressure because
of the dynamics of the spiritual life and his complete dependence of God's
grace resources. Paul is totally helpless about the thorn in the flesh, but God
is providing maximum power and Jesus Christ is the celebrity!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Conclusions</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Here is the demonstration of the power and strength of
the maximum use of the enabling power of the Holy Spirit in the mature
believer’s spiritual life. The spiritually mature believer when faced with a
very tough high-pressure situation where they are totally helpless, becomes totally
dependent on the divine power of the Holy Spirit and in their application of
the <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine to the situation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Grace dynamics are fulfilled in the absolute helplessness
of the mature believer. A mature believer is helpless and knows they cannot
deal with the situation with human viewpoint or human capabilities. They have
no illusions about themselves. They depend on the enabling power of the Holy
Spirit in the tough situations and remain calm and in a state of contentment.
They know and have the faith to trust in the power of God to handle the
situation. They have learned to stand back and wait on the deliverance of the
Lord.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is no test that a mature believer cannot handle.
The test may hurt badly. It can cause the believer to take a false step or a
true step. There is no greater power resident in the life of the believer than
the power of God functioning under His grace resources in time of maximum
suffering. 1 Cor. 10:13. </p>

<p class=Verses>“No temptation has overtaken you but such as is common to man;
and God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are
able, but with the temptation will provide the way of escape also, so that you
will be able to endure it.”  (1 Corinthians 10:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Even Calvary was taken in stride by the Lord Jesus
Christ. Every provision was made for you in time even in a nation under
apostacy to bear up under the most awful conditions! Luke 22 through Luke 24;
Heb. 12; 2 Cor. 12:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He has said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for
power is perfected in weakness.” Most gladly, therefore, I will rather boast
about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me.”  (2
Corinthians 12:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The very grace of Jesus Christ that took Him through the Cross
is at your disposal. The Holy Spirit empowers your life under maximum pressure
as He did for Stephen in Acts 7:54-56.</p>

<p class=Verses> “Now when they heard this, they were cut to the quick, and
they began gnashing their teeth at him. But being full of the Holy Spirit, he
gazed intently into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the
right hand of God; and he said, “Behold, I see the heavens opened up and the
Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.”“  (Acts 7:54-56, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ troubleshoots the mature believer and
encourages them under maximum pressure. Phil. 2:1. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is
any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any
affection and compassion,”  (Philippians 2:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ was tested in all points. Heb. 4:15. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with
our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet
without sin.”  (Hebrews 4:15, NASB)</p>
