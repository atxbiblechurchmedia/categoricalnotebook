<h2><a name="_D-Mental_Attitude_Under"></a><a name="_D-Military_Service"></a><a
name="_Military_Service"></a>Military Service</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Very few realize that the Word of God does have answers
with hundreds of chapters bearing directly on the military problems that face
us. The Bible warns against Socialism and peace at any price. Any price is the
price of slavery. The Bible warns against; marching in mass demonstrations to
get your way, no win military policies, continued civilian intervention into
military operations once deployed, peaceful coexistence with tyrannical
socialistic governments, and a large number of free-loaders in a society that
suck the vitality out of a nation’s economic stability.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Furthermore, Jesus Christ was not a long-haired hippy
type going around whispering sweet platitudes of “Peace, brother, peace.” Yes,
Christ is for peace. In fact, He is the Prince of Peace, but not the stupid,
sentimental, sloppy peace that is so often paraded around in the so-called area
of Christianity. Christ is for peace through regeneration not reformation.
Christ is for peace through spirituality not human good solutions which always
come to nothing. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The soldier in military service must be oriented to the
times in which we live.<b> </b>This is the area that the soldier can see. In
our times, wars and rumors of wars is the fare of the day. Only in the
Millennium will peace will be universal. Matt. 24:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You will be hearing of wars and rumors of wars. See that
you are not frightened, for those things must take place, but that is not yet
the end.” (Matthew 24:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We know that the soul of man is almost always controlled
by the old sin nature. James 4:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“What is the source of quarrels and conflicts among you? Is not
the source your pleasures that wage war in your members? You lust and do not
have; so you commit murder. You are envious and cannot obtain; so you fight and
quarrel. You do not have because you do not ask.” (James 4:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Today, even the family structure of our nation cannot get
along without scrapping and fighting. Truth rejected causes conflict! Matt.
10:34-36. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Do not think that I came to bring peace on the earth; I
did not come to bring peace, but a sword. &quot;For I came to SET A MAN AGAINST
HIS FATHER, AND A DAUGHTER AGAINST HER MOTHER, AND A DAUGHTER-IN-LAW AGAINST
HER MOTHER-IN-LAW; and A MAN'S ENEMIES WILL BE THE MEMBERS OF HIS HOUSEHOLD.”
(Matthew 10:34-36, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A soldier in military service must be oriented to the
difference between killing and murder as defined in the Word of God. In Exodus
20:13, “Thou shalt not murder” means that murder is never condoned in Scripture.
When Cain murdered Abel, in Genesis 4:11-12, God cursed Cain for his sin. When David
killed Goliath, it was in battle and was considered a noble act in defense of
his nation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Man has the right to take a human life only under two
principles – acts of war and capital punishment. For acts of war, there are
countless references in the Bible where waging war is encouraged by the Lord.
Often, war is an act of God’s judgment on another nation, like the Canaanite
civilization in the Book of Joshua.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You shall not murder.” (Exodus 20:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its
mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand. &quot;When you cultivate
the ground, it will no longer yield its strength to you; you will be a vagrant
and a wanderer on the earth.&quot;” (Genesis 4:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The principle of capital punishment was introduced in
Genesis 9 and developed throughout the Word of God. This even extends to
protection of life and property. For an intruder who breaks into a house and
seeks to inflict bodily harm on those living there, our laws should allow those
living there to protect themselves from harm by any means available. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Bible is for the citizen’s right to own firearms
without registration. Registration of firearms takes away the rights of the
honest citizen. The soldier must be knowledgeable in the difference between
killing and murder.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A soldier is already defeated by their defeatist mental
attitude usually before they are ever defeated physically. A born again soldier
must become spiritually mature because the moment they are born again, they
either have to go forward in the spiritual life or become miserable. In maturing
spiritually, the soldier must remember that the battle will be in their mind and
there will be fears and feelings of guilt. Rom. 7:15; Rom. 7:23; 2 Tim. 1:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For what I am doing, I do not understand; for I am not
practicing what I would like to do, but I am doing the very thing I hate.”
(Romans 7:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“but I see a different law in the members of my body, waging
war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin which
is in my members.” (Romans 7:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of power
and love and discipline.” (2 Timothy 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Serviceman’s Three Great Problems</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You might have been guessing what problems our servicemen
face and wondering what three stand out. Some may immediately think of the
danger they face overseas, but no, life hangs by a slim thread anywhere,
anytime. You can face grave danger in your own home. Others may think of the
problem of homesickness or drugs or immorality or alcohol. No, those are
problems and large problems at times, but that isn’t hitting the nail on the
head. The three greatest problems faced by those in military service are fear,
unbelief, and disrespect for authority.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Fear</u>  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first mental attitude problem the serviceman faces is
the problem of fear. They may fear death. They may fear because of a guilt
complex. They may fear because they are unstable. An example of a whole
battalion being shook is found in 1 Samuel 17 otherwise known as the Goliath
episode. Goliath was the champ, but a pompous loudmouth. The Philistines were
Greek and proud of body and military training. 1 Sam. 17:3-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The Philistines stood on the mountain on one side while Israel
stood on the mountain on the other side, with the valley between them. Then a
champion came out from the armies of the Philistines named Goliath, from Gath,
whose height was six cubits and a span. He had a bronze helmet on his head, and
he was clothed with scale-armor which weighed five thousand shekels of bronze.
He also had bronze greaves on his legs and a bronze javelin slung between his
shoulders. The shaft of his spear was like a weaver's beam, and the head of his
spear weighed six hundred shekels of iron; his shield-carrier also walked
before him. He stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel and said to them,
&quot;Why do you come out to draw up in battle array? Am I not the Philistine
and you servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves and let him come down to
me. &quot;If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will become your
servants; but if I prevail against him and kill him, then you shall become our
servants and serve us.&quot; Again the Philistine said, &quot;I defy the ranks
of Israel this day; give me a man that we may fight together.&quot;” (1 Samuel
17:3-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The reaction of the soldiers of Israel was that they were
dismayed and greatly afraid. 1 Sam. 17:11. </p>

<p class=Verses>“When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine,
they were dismayed and greatly afraid.” (1 Samuel 17:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Their mental attitude was shot. David’s mental attitude
was to trust in the Lord’s deliverance.  David provided a heroic example of
God's solution to the problem. David as a believer applied the promises of God
to Israel as the solution. 1 Sam. 17:23-47. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then it happened when the Philistine rose and came and drew
near to meet David, that David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the
Philistine.” (1 Samuel 17:48, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And David put his hand into his bag and took from it a stone
and slung it, and struck the Philistine on his forehead. And the stone sank
into his forehead, so that he fell on his face to the ground. Thus David
prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone, and he struck the
Philistine and killed him; but there was no sword in David's hand.” (1 Samuel
17:49-50, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Unbelief</u> </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A cynical, atheistic, devil may care attitude was
illustrated by Eliab, David’s brother in 1 Samuel 17:28ff.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now Eliab his oldest brother heard when he spoke to the men;
and Eliab's anger burned against David and he said, &quot;Why have you come
down? And with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know
your insolence and the wickedness of your heart; for you have come down in
order to see the battle.&quot;” (1 Samuel 17:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Your unbelief can lead to many snares and many rat traps.
It can make you scorn what Christianity is all about and as such rob you of
life. It can get you obligated to the wrong kind of woman in marriage or
otherwise. It can get you hooked on drugs and take you on greased skids to
hell. It can make you a nice person, but a hollow person who is superficial and
misinformed. It can get you into the religion bracket.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The answer to unbelief is personal acceptance of Jesus Christ
as your Savior and a change in mental attitude toward Bible doctrine with
positive volition. John 1:12; 2 Peter 3:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to
become children of God, even to those who believe in His name,” (John 1:12,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory, both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.”
(2 Peter 3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Disrespect for Authority </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A serviceman must understand authority of their parents,
their coaches, the school teacher, the policeman, God, their pastor-teacher,
the Word of God, and a superior officer in the military. Authority is your
life. It is your friend. It is the key to discipline, to purpose, and to
achieving the maximum in life. Prov. 30:11-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“There is a kind of man who curses his father And does not
bless his mother. There is a kind who is pure in his own eyes, Yet is not
washed from his filthiness. There is a kind—oh how lofty are his eyes! And his
eyelids are raised in arrogance. There is a kind of man whose teeth are like
swords And his jaw teeth like knives, To devour the afflicted from the earth
And the needy from among men. The leech has two daughters, &quot;Give,&quot;
&quot;Give.&quot; There are three things that will not be satisfied, Four that
will not say, &quot;Enough&quot;: Sheol, and the barren womb, Earth that is
never satisfied with water, And fire that never says, &quot;Enough.&quot; The
eye that mocks a father And scorns a mother, The ravens of the valley will pick
it out, And the young eagles will eat it.” (Proverbs 30:11-17, NASB)</p>
