<h2><a name="_D-Marriage,_The_Wife’s"></a><a name="_Marriage,_The_Wife’s"></a>Marriage,
The Wife’s Responsibilities and Characteristics</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Respect Your Husband</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The wife is never commanded to love her husband. The wife
is “encouraged” (<span lang=EL>φι</span>́<span lang=EL>λανδρος</span>)
philandros) to love her husband in response to her husband’s demonstrated
leadership love. This is <i>phileo</i> love, rapport love, response love, soul
love, based on her husband’s <i>agapao</i> love, his unconditional mental
attitude love. Titus 2:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“so that they may encourage the young women to love their
husbands, to love their children,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Titus 2:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Respect is the highest form of love the woman can have
for the man. Respect is an act of giving particular attention or consideration,
admiration, giving high or special regard, deference, or esteem. The man
receiving of such high regard occupies a special place in the soul of the
woman. Eph. 5:33.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Nevertheless, each individual among you also is to love his
own wife even as himself, and the wife must see to it that she respects her
husband.” (Ephesians 5:33, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>No woman should ever marry a man she cannot respect. Respect
is mandated of the woman and is more important than her love. Without the
discernment from Bible doctrine to be able to recognize a man who is worthy of
such respect, most women exercise very poor judgment about men from only their emotions,
sexual attraction, etc.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The woman should have a personal love for God the Father
which is her motivation for love toward a man. This results in the development
of the unconditional mental attitude <i>agapao</i> love based on the Bible
doctrine in her soul. When the wife respects what she sees in her husband’s
spiritual leadership, his demonstrated love for her, and what is in his soul, she
responds. This makes for a very successful marriage.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The wife’s attitude toward her husband is described as
respect. It is only from respect that the woman is motivated to respond. The
man develops leadership characteristics as he grows spiritually. Where there is
leadership in the husband, there is respect in the wife. Respect is the basis
for the wife’s obedience to her husband’s leadership authority and exhibited
love for her.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If the man does not gain the respect of the woman through
Bible doctrine in his soul, the marriage will never work. Before the woman chooses
to marry a man, she should confirm that she respects him. She should ask
herself objectively and without emotion whether she can accept the authority of
this man for the rest of her life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Where the woman cannot respect the man, the marriage has
little chance of survival. Even if the man exhibits leadership and demonstrates
his love for the woman and she cannot respect him, then they should not marry.
If they are already married, they both need to focus on spiritual growth to
develop the characteristics in their souls that God intended for the marriage.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Respond to Your Husband’s Authority</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is the wife's biblical responsibility to be under
the leadership authority of her husband in love. The wife may react because the
man is not leading, but it is her responsibility to not react, but confess sins
to God the Father using 1 John 1:9 and thus be filled with the Spirit. 1 John
1:9; Eph. 5:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but
be filled with the Spirit,” (Ephesians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The man was given authority over the woman in marriage.
The woman being under the authority of the man in marriage was never meant to
be demeaning in any way. The woman was placed under the authority of the man by
God to heighten her capacity for love as a responder. The husband’s leadership
authority was designed by God to encapsulate and protect the woman for her
blessing, her protection, and her greatness feminine role of responder. The
woman has equal privilege and equal opportunity with the man to fulfill God's
plan for their lives. Gal. 3:28.</p>

<p class=Verses>“There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor
free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ
Jesus.” (Galatians 3:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ’s authority over the Church is analogous to
the husband’s authority over his wife in marriage. The husband’s authority must
be based on his leadership. His leadership must be based on his unconditional
love for his wife and his personal love for her. Both categories of the
husband’s love grow as the husband grows spiritually. Eph. 5:22-24.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord. For
the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church,
He Himself being the Savior of the body. But as the church is subject to
Christ, so also the wives ought to be to their husbands in everything.”
(Ephesians 5:22-24, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The wife must have some degree of spiritual advance to
fulfill this command. The wife is commanded to “be subject” to her husband in
Ephesians 5:24 based on her personal love for the Lord Jesus Christ. “Be
subject to” is <span lang=EL>υ</span>̔<span lang=EL>ποτα</span>́<span lang=EL>σσω</span>
(hupotassō) in the Greek and is a military term meaning to line up under rank
authority. It simply recognizes the headship of the authority of the husband.
The wife’s submission to her husband is actually the way that she expresses her
submission to Christ. The wife cannot express submission to the Word of God
while challenging her husband’s authority. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As Christ is the head of and the deliverer of the Church,
the Body of Christ, so the husband is the head of the marriage union of the man
and woman. As the Church responds to its head, so the wife responds to her
husband. This is done without violating the wife’s volition. The man cannot
destroy the wife’s volition in the process. Respond to the authority that the
Lord has provided. Humility comes from obeying the Word of God and obeying
authority. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The wife fulfills or completes the husband and the
husband leads in love and is thereby completed. Marriage is designed by God and
in order to be successful it requires the man to be thoughtful and considerate
of the woman establishing his authority in love. 1 Cor. 11:7-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For a man ought not to have his head covered, since he is the
image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. For man does not
originate from woman, but woman from man; for indeed man was not created for
the woman's sake, but woman for the man's sake. Therefore the woman ought to
have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels. However, in the
Lord, neither is woman independent of man, nor is man independent of woman. For
as the woman originates from the man, so also the man has his birth through the
woman; and all things originate from God.” (1 Corinthians 11:7-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The husband is the protector and establishes his
authority in love. This is the standard for husbands. Virtue and humility are
necessary for a successful marriage. This is a reference to authority. Grace
means you don't try harder. Get with the Word of God and love the Lord Jesus
Christ and in turn love your mate.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The wife obeys her husband because of the <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine in her soul. This also means that her love for her husband is
stabilized by the unconditional mental attitude <i>agapao</i> love she has for
him based on the Bible doctrine in her soul, not necessarily his exemplary
behavior.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Biblical response to the authority of some husbands can
be one of the greatest tests in life for the wife. If the wife reacts to her
husband, she is out of fellowship and will remain so until she confesses her
known sins to God the Father and regains the filling of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The wife who respects her husband is the highest form of
love response, because it is love response in the soul. The divine mandate to
the wife demands that the wife respect the husband.  The subordination to the
authority of her husband is the result of the respect she has for him.  The wife’s
orientation to her husband’s leadership authority cannot be enforced by the
husband. The wife must respond from her free will from her own soul. Anything a
woman gives through coercion is not worth having.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Colossians 3:18, “be subject” is the present middle
imperative of <span lang=EL>υ</span>̔<span lang=EL>ποτα</span>́<span lang=EL>σσω</span>
(hupotassō) and means to submit or to render obedience. In any relationship,
there must be authority. God has mandated the authority and greater
responsibility to the husband in marriage. The husband has the duty to take
responsibility and to protect his wife. As a leader, he should always think of
his wife first and himself second. The husband cannot fulfill his
responsibilities in marriage without spiritual growth. The wife’s mandate is to
orient to her husband’s leadership authority.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the
Lord.” (Colossians 3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Marriage is not a master-slave relationship. In 1 Peter
3:1-2, “be submissive” is <span lang=EL>υ</span>̔<span lang=EL>ποτα</span>́<span
lang=EL>σσω</span> (hupotassō) and means to know the characteristics of, a
mental attitude love, a rapport love. This is a mental attitude response to
authority, to her husband as spiritual leader of the home. Her soul through
Bible doctrine has an opening in every facet for the right kind of man.
Dressing up the body to attract the right person is useless without the right
lobe of the soul being “dressed up” in <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine. Through
spiritual growth, she will obey the divine mandate to be submissive to her
husband. </p>

<p class=Verses>“In the same way, you wives, be submissive to your own husbands
so that even if any of them are disobedient to the word, they may be won
without a word by the behavior of their wives, as they observe your chaste and
respectful behavior.” (1 Peter 3:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Behavior” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>ναστροφη</span>́
(anastrophē) and means behavior, conduct, manner of life, and way of life.
This is the outward behavior that comes from her inner beauty. Through the
woman’s free will in marriage, she chooses to surrender her soul and her body
to one man to keep as long as they both shall live. As the Lord Jesus Christ is
the protector or guardian of the soul of all believers, so the husband is the
protector or guardian of his wife’s body and soul. She surrenders her soul to
him. This sets up in her body a system of responses which make marriage a
fantastic thing.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A right relationship and fellowship brings out the
instincts of love. The wife knows instinctively what will please her husband.
Being a nag, being moody, or giving him the silent treatment breaks down the
marriage relationship. Instead, a wife is to have inner beauty, have a mental
attitude of grace. Grace produces inner beauty. Inner beauty is a relaxed
blamelessness produced by the filling of the Holy Spirit and by application of <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine from her soul. This spiritual discernment enables her to use
God's grace resources to orient to the plan of God for her life. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Woman as a Responder</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Word of God teaches that the husband should
understand his wife and that the wife should understand herself as a responder.
In 1 Peter 3:7, “live with” is the present active participle of <span lang=EL>συνοικε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (sunoikeō) and means to dwell with and refers to sexual
intercourse or having a sexual relationship. “In an understanding way” means to
know what it is all about. The man must be thinking of the woman, her design,
and must have her interests in mind. The man must have self-discipline. A man
that has sex to gratify himself is the lowest kind of biped.</p>

<p class=Verses>“You husbands in the same way, live with your wives in an
understanding way, as with someone weaker, since she is a woman; and show her
honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life, so that your prayers will not be
hindered.” (1 Peter 3:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Show her honor” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>πονε</span>́<span
lang=EL>μω</span> (aponemō) means to assign or allot from the ultimate source
of oneself, to assign from yourself value to your wife. This means there is a
right kind of woman for the man and a right kind of man for the woman. The rest
of the men or women will not be the right fit. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Lord fulfills the soul through Bible doctrine. The
man fulfills the woman’s soul through marriage. “As with someone weaker”
doesn’t mean weaker physically, intellectually or spiritually. This is a
dative, singular, neuter, comparative meaning helpless, without strength in
regard to man. “So that your prayers will not be hindered” is <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span
lang=EL>γκο</span>́<span lang=EL>πτω</span> (egkoptō) and means to interrupt,
to impede, to constantly hinder. It is not God’s purpose that the prayers of
married people be hindered. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The woman is called “weaker” because of her insatiable
desire for her man. She has an incompleteness, an unfulfillment without him.
This makes her weaker and more vulnerable because she is a responder. In the
woman, positive volition toward God provides inner beauty and positive volition
toward her man provides her response. The woman was designed to complete and to
compliment the man. Therefore, the woman becomes the glory of the man. “As a
fellow heir of the grace of life” means every blessing is doubled in marriage.
And inversely, trouble is doubled. Gen. 3:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“To the woman He said, &quot;I will greatly multiply Your pain
in childbirth, In pain you will bring forth children; Yet your desire will be
for your husband, And he will rule over you.&quot;” (Genesis 3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>She is a responder and for this reason, she can submit
mentally and sexually to her husband. This submission is mental rather than
sexual. Sex is an expression of this submission, but first of all there must be
the mental attitude love.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The wife is to be a help to the husband. This means to be
responding to her husband, not just helping. You don't marry someone just to
help you, but to love. The man with virtue from Bible doctrine in his soul looks
for a woman with virtue from Bible doctrine in her soul to complete him. The
woman is created to be a responder - to follow in love. The Lord Jesus Christ
put Adam to sleep and took one of his ribs and fashioned a woman. The woman
must be attractive to the man. The woman wants control and is turned off by
this. Eve was extremely beautiful to Adam, but love from spiritual advancement
must be the basis of marriage. God brought the woman to the man - they had no
sin. Arrogance destroyed the first marriage in history. Gen. 2:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD God said, &quot;It is not good for the man to be
alone; I will make him a helper suitable for him.&quot;” (Genesis 2:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Without a mental attitude love on the part of the wife,
this submission cannot exist. However, she may go through the motions
outwardly, but this is not true submission, but slavery. When there is no
mental attitude love, her surrender becomes slavery.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If the woman is in love with her husband, she is happy to
surrender her freedom to the one she loves. When this surrender is properly
carried out, her relationship with her husband is of such a nature that it
brings out all the beauty and charm which can be found in a woman. True
femininity surpasses all other types of beauty.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Since the first marriage of Adam and the woman in the
Garden of Eden, the role of the husband and the wife were defined by the Lord
Jesus Christ who created the universe. The man was given by God the authority
over the woman and over the world.  Since God married the Adam and Eve, this
rule applies to both marriage and life in general. In the marriage
relationship, biologically the woman is a responder, the man is the aggressor.
The wife needs to understand the response area and respond to him at the proper
time. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When the wife responds with respect to her husband’s
expression of love for her, she brings great blessing to him. As a responder,
the wife does not lose her freedom to choose that one man for marriage to whom
she can respond, respect, admire, and obey. In her response, she obeys because
she chooses to respond to his authority. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The man must never use his authority by being abusive. If
he does, he destroys her volitional function resulting in her resenting him and
even hating him. No woman will ever love a man who throws his weight around
instead of using his leadership authority in love.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When the husband is irritable, the wife should not
respond even though basically she is a responder. She should treat him in grace
with an unconditional mental attitude love even though he doesn’t earn or
deserve it. The wife, with a mental attitude of grace, realizes her husband is
not fulfilling his responsibility of the marriage, but she carries on careful
to stay in fellowship with the Lord. This attitude of grace goes far in winning
the unbelieving husband to the Lord. 1 Peter 3:1; 1 Cor. 7:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“In the same way, you wives, be submissive to your own husbands
so that even if any of them are disobedient to the word, they may be won
without a word by the behavior of their wives,” (1 Peter 3:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For how do you know, O wife, whether you will save your
husband? Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save your wife?” (1
Corinthians 7:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The inner beauty of the woman results from her spiritual
life. As a responder, the woman enhances her natural beauty and charm with
great inner beauty of the soul. In the woman’s response, she is free to choose
to give happiness to a man in friendship, romance, or marriage.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A woman’s highest form of love is her respect for another
person. When the woman has respect for a man, her love is genuine and fulfills
the Word of God related to personal love in the spiritual life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the woman’s role as a mother, where the mother is a
believer, her first responsibility is her relationship to the Lord and to stay
in fellowship and to learn Bible doctrine. She is responsible to teach her
children by how she talks and making the Gospel clear to them when possible and
by her manner of living or her Christian way of life. Deut. 6:6-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>““These words, which I am commanding you today, shall be on
your heart. “You shall teach them diligently to your sons and shall talk of
them when you sit in your house and when you walk by the way and when you lie
down and when you rise up. “You shall bind them as a sign on your hand and they
shall be as frontals on your forehead. “You shall write them on the doorposts
of your house and on your gates.”  (Deuteronomy 6:6-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The family is sanctified because she is a believer. Her family
comes under the grace extended to her by blessing when she is in fellowship and
protection of her by her guardian angel. At the Rapture, a child who has not
reached the age of accountability or one who is not capable of making a
decision, will go with the believing parent. 1 Cor. 7:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the unbelieving husband is sanctified through his wife,
and the unbelieving wife is sanctified through her believing husband; for
otherwise your children are unclean, but now they are holy.” (1 Corinthians
7:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In extreme cases, if the husband refuses to let her teach
the children the Word, the authority of the Word supersedes the authority of
the husband. At the same time, she should treat him in mental attitude grace, a
result of the filling of the Holy Spirit. Her submission in other areas and her
mental attitude of grace in marriage, resulting from the filling of the Holy
Spirit will go far in winning an unbelieving husband to the Lord.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Hindrances To Responding</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Although the woman is a responder, the capacity for the
woman to respond is hindered by certain things. Wives are to be subject to
their husbands. Eph. 5:22. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord.” 
(Ephesians 5:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The omission of the verb here gives emphasis. Some women
are never capable of responding a man’s love. They include five types. The first
type is the woman who lives by a system of tantrums. This woman becomes
hysterical or ill when things do not go her way. She is incapable of any
response, has no capacity for love, and is the neurotic type who merely wants
someone to fan her ego and is motivated by the ego lust of her old sin nature.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The second type is the woman who is jealous and envious. Jealousy
and envy destroy her inner beauty of soul and her true femininity. This is a
woman who is a habitual gossip and is generally a miserable, frustrated,
jealous, and disorientated person.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The third type is the frustrated domineering woman. They
run their poor milquetoast husbands into the ground and may even try to run the
local church. The fourth type is the woman who wants to retread or remold her
husband to conform to her own idealistic pattern or image, which she has
established regarding husbands.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Other types of women having varying degrees of response
include the woman who marries to get away from home, for money and security,
because she assumes this is her last chance to get married, or because all her
friends are getting married. Some women marry because they are in love with
love, not with the person, just the idea of love. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Others marry and spend their lifetime trying to
demonstrate their intellectual superiority because they happen to have married
a man who is a little slower in thought, or maybe not as bright. Therefore, she
assumes her superiority over the human race because she is married to such an
individual. This woman has no capacity for love in marriage.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The answer for the woman believer to regain her ability
to respond is always confession of sin to God the Father resulting in the
filling of the Holy Spirit and then the daily intake and application of Bible
doctrine functioning under the grace apparatus for perception. 1 John 1:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Woman’s Five Characteristics</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are five characteristics of the woman taught in the
New Testament - the responsive woman, the reacting woman, the woman instructor,
the vulnerable woman, and the beautiful woman.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Responsive Woman</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>While all men have different personalities, their love
for their wife must come from the spiritual life based on the <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine in their soul. The believer out of fellowship is the worst
husband in town. Eph. 5:33.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Nevertheless, each individual among you also is to love his
own wife even as himself, and the wife must see to it that she respects her
husband.” (Ephesians 5:33, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Submission to legitimate authority for the man and the
woman means you have learned something. This is a measure of your humility and teachability.
All wisdom is associated with humility. You never learn while you are talking
or not paying attention. The woman is a responder and was given the ability to
respond in her soul, because in marriage she is under the authority of the man.
When a woman is reacting to her husband, she is out of fellowship with the Lord
and her emotions are in control. In this state, she is not thinking and she is
not learning. 1 Tim. 2:11-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“A woman must quietly receive instruction with entire
submissiveness. But I do not allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over
a man, but to remain quiet. For it was Adam who was first created, and then
Eve. And it was not Adam who was deceived, but the woman being deceived, fell
into transgression.” (1 Timothy 2:11-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This verse says that women can advise other women, but
not in groups. Older women should counsel and teach younger women regarding how
to love their husbands and their children. A woman must learn how to love a
husband because she is a responder.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If a woman reacts to legitimate authority, she will not be
listening. If she is reacting to the authority of the pastor-teacher teaching
Bible doctrine, then she will ignore the doctrine taught and will justify
deviation from that doctrine. If she persists in this condition, she is on the
slippery slope of reversionism. This principle also holds true for men.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When the first woman reacted to her husband’s (Adam’s)
authority and God's authority in the Garden of Eden, she began to respond to
another’s conversations outside of the marriage. In this case, it was the Satan-indwelled
serpent. The woman had rejected the teaching of our Lord in the Garden and had rejected
her husband’s authority.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When the woman reacts, she can find herself getting into
many mental attitude sins and related overt sins. Gossip is one of those sins.
No matter how overtly beautiful a woman may be, she becomes ugly in her soul in
continual reaction. 1 Tim. 3:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Women must likewise be dignified, not malicious gossips, but
temperate, faithful in all things.” (1 Timothy 3:11, NASB)                      </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Dignified” is <span lang=EL>σεμνο</span>́<span lang=EL>ς</span>
(semnos) and means honorable, noble, above reproach. It refers to the results
of spiritual maturity. It refers to living the spiritual life so that her
friendships, romance, and marriage will be honorable. “Temperate” is <span
lang=EL>νηφα</span>́<span lang=EL>λεος</span> (nēphaleos) and means to moderate
your intake of wine and to be wise in the use of wine. When a woman drinks too
much, she becomes vulnerable to the man who wants to use her. “Faithful in all
things” means she has a scale of values that she lives by. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Reacting Woman</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When a woman is reacting to someone she loves, she
becomes weak and is vulnerable to the advances of other men. Weak women are
vulnerable to flattery from arrogant men who will take advantage of them when
they are weak. 2 Tim. 3:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For among them are those who enter into households and
captivate weak women weighed down with sins, led on by various impulses,” (2
Timothy 3:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The reacting woman has stopped responding to the man she
loves and is in a state of reaction to him. In 1 Timothy 5:6, “wanton” is <span
lang=EL>σπαταλα</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (spatalaō) and means headstrong
and willful, sexually lawless and unrestrained. The reacting woman becomes
socially competitive, unrestrained, provocative sexually, and vulnerable to
flattery. The reacting woman can become wanton when her soul is controlled by
the sin nature’s lust patterns. The result leads to fornication and adultery.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“But she who gives herself to wanton pleasure is dead even
while she lives.” (1 Timothy 5:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Dead while she lives” means she has destroyed her soul
by continued reaction and carnality. This can lead to the type of adulterous woman
described in Proverbs 5:3-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the lips of an adulteress drip honey And smoother than oil
is her speech; But in the end she is bitter as wormwood, Sharp as a two-edged
sword. Her feet go down to death, Her steps take hold of Sheol.” (Proverbs
5:3-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The reacting woman seems to be unable to do the things
she would be motivated to do when she is responding and becomes idle. In 1
Timothy 5:13, “busybodies” is <span lang=EL>περι</span>́<span lang=EL>εργος</span>
(periergos) and means meddlesome, busy about trifles and neglectful of
important matters, especially busy about other people’s affairs, one who pays
attention to things that do not concern them or are none of their business.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“At the same time they also learn to be idle, as they go around
from house to house; and not merely idle, but also gossips and busybodies,
talking about things not proper to mention.” (1 Timothy 5:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>However, the reacting woman can always recover from her
self-destructive thinking and actions by confession of sin and return to
fellowship with God. The recovery path is always the same regardless of the sin
or past failures - the intake and application of the Word of God by being under
the teaching of a doctrinal pastor-teacher in a local church. Bible doctrine in
the soul results in renovated thinking. It’s all God's grace. Rom. 12:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by
the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that
which is good and acceptable and perfect.” (Romans 12:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Woman Instructor</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritually mature women are able and have a mandate to
teach younger women how to love her husbands and how to love their children. A
woman must learn how to love her husband and her children. Titus 2:3-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Older women likewise are to be reverent in their behavior, not
malicious gossips nor enslaved to much wine, teaching what is good, so that
they may encourage the young women to love their husbands, to love their
children, to be sensible, pure, workers at home, kind, being subject to their
own husbands, so that the word of God will not be dishonored.” (Titus 2:3-5,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Only a spiritually mature woman can encourage, counsel,
and teach another woman about herself and instruct her in spiritual matters applicable
only to women. The spiritually mature woman is able to teach another woman how
to respond to the Lord rather than react to the circumstances of life related
to marriage. Younger women must be taught how and when to be thoughtful,
sensitive, and to understand that other people may often have different points
of view on any given subject. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The wife who is reacting to her husband is out of
fellowship and not necessarily receptive to the divine wisdom from the older
woman. The wife in this state does not love her husband or her children. Only a
spiritually mature woman can finesse the situation and focus on encouragement
and getting the younger woman to focus on the Word of God and the very
important biblical role the woman plays as the responder in the marriage. The
woman has to learn to love because she was created by God to be a responder.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher’s primary function is to study the
Word and to teach Bible doctrine to his assembled congregation in the local
church. His function is not to council anyone privately. The Holy Spirit
provides the wise counsel through the teaching of Bible doctrine to believers
in the congregation rather than teaching or counseling one-on-one.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is no substitute for the believer’s objective self-evaluation
based on the Bible doctrine in their soul. A believer’s ability to handle the
problems they encounter in life comes directly from their application of Bible
doctrine to the situation through the filling of the Holy Spirit. Bible
doctrine in their soul and the filling of the Holy Spirit enables them to
recognize the true problem and then to decide to apply Bible doctrine to the
problem instead of from human viewpoint.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Vulnerable Woman</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The vulnerable woman is a woman who is reacting in her
relationship to her husband or the man she loves in friendship or romance. She
is out of fellowship and operating under control of her sin nature. In her
state of carnality, the reacting woman may go looking for another man to whom
she can respond. She becomes vulnerable to flattery, jealousy, and bitterness.
She can be manipulated because of her altered thinking while out of fellowship.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>She may have reacted emotionally and become negative to
Bible doctrine. Prolonged carnality leads to reversionism. Down that path, she
may become involved in anything. 2 Tim. 3:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But realize this, that in the last days difficult times will
come. For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant,
revilers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy, unloving, irreconcilable,
malicious gossips, without self-control, brutal, haters of good, treacherous,
reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,” (2 Timothy
3:1-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The solution to all of our failures and bad decisions in
life is confession of our known sins to God the Father resulting in filling of
the Holy Spirit, the consistent intake and application of Bible doctrine, and
resultant spiritual growth. God's grace and the filling of the Holy Spirit
provide the means to correct the past, advance in the spiritual life, and to
fulfill the plan of God for your life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Beautiful Woman</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Not all women would be considered outwardly beautiful. However,
women who have accepted Jesus Christ as their Savior can develop an inner beauty
of the soul. The inner beauty of the soul is developed by the consistent intake
and application of Bible doctrine and thereby growing spiritually. The spiritually
maturing female believer develops a long-term inner beauty of the soul. Such a
woman becomes more beautiful with spiritual maturity while her body ages. There
is nothing more beautiful than the spiritually mature woman with inner beauty.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Women who are considered by many to be physically
beautiful often become arrogant about their outward beauty. They desire
continual reaffirmation of their outward beauty while ignoring the condition of
their soul. Such women depend on their beauty to gain the attention of men and
even the less than approving looks from other women less endowed with outward
beauty. These women live for flattery and attention from others. They have no
values beyond themselves. Such behavior is self-destructive.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A spiritually discerning man will never be attracted to a
woman with a shallow soul. He is looking beyond the outward beauty to her
soul’s condition. What is in her soul? Divine wisdom from <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine? Only arrogance and desire for attention from anyone? </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Many beautiful women become arrogant and develop behaviors
and ways of speaking to cover their ugly soul. It is important for a woman to
look into the mirror of the Word of God and see what is really in her soul. When
a woman looks into a mirror and sees her great beauty, this can distract her
from developing an inner beauty of the soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Any woman can develop her inner beauty. In 1 Timothy
2:9-10, “discreetly” is <span lang=EL>σωφροσυ</span>́<span lang=EL>νη</span>
(sōphrosunē) and means rational without illusion, reasonable, proper or
virtuous conduct, decency, chastity.  It refers to the function and
coordination of the various parts of the soul. This includes tremendous
knowledge and humility. This is the inner beauty of the woman’s soul from
living and growing in the spiritual life.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Likewise, I want women to adorn themselves with proper
clothing, modestly and discreetly, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or
costly garments, but rather by means of good works, as is proper for women
making a claim to godliness.” (1 Timothy 2:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The born again woman can have an inner beauty of the soul
that more than compensates for any defects in her physical beauty. While there is
nothing wrong or sinful about wearing braided hair, gold, pearls, or expensive
clothing, these things are of lower importance when compared to the inner
beauty of the soul. Being physically beautiful and dressing well has never been
mandated as part of the spiritual life.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Female believers are mandated to make themselves
beautiful regardless of their external looks. This divine command cannot be
fulfilled through emphasis on the exterior. Growing spiritually is the only
means to fulfill the development of the inner beauty of the soul mandated by
God for all believers. 2 Peter 3:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory, both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.”
(2 Peter 3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Woman’s Vulnerability</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God invented marriage when he married Adam and the woman.
Marriage became the first divine institution in human history that involved
more than one person. Marriage stabilizes a society.  From the spiritual stability
of the husband and wife comes stability in the society.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Because the marriage relationship exists between two
people, God also mandated a system of authority in marriage where the man was
given the authority over the woman. This is leadership authority based on the
husband’s love for his wife. The wife responds to this love. 1 Tim. 2:11-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“A woman must quietly receive instruction with entire
submissiveness. But I do not allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over
a man, but to remain quiet.” (1 Timothy 2:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Women are responders and are mandated to learn through
listening. We all must learn by not talking, but quietly listening. This is
humility and teachability. The quiet teachable woman has Bible doctrine in her
soul and applies that doctrine to respond to yet more teaching. The woman’s
soul must find something to which to respond. The responses come from learning. 
When a woman reacts, she is not listening to what is being said, but rather is
thinking of what she intends to say. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Timothy 2:14, the woman had reacted to her husband’s
authority and rejected his authority. She was in a vulnerable state and wanted
to learn something new and different. Satan provided that new and different
information as he deceived her. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And it was not Adam who was deceived, but the woman being
deceived, fell into transgression.” (1 Timothy 2:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When a woman stops responding to the man she loves, she
begins reacting to him. In reaction mode, she is out of fellowship and
operating under her old sin nature’s control. Reaction destroys the spiritual norms
and standards in her soul and makes her vulnerable to reversionism or moving backward
in her spiritual life. Only her return to fellowship through confession of sins
to God the Father can she begin the renovation of her thinking through the
intake and application of Bible doctrine. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Active and Passive Woman and Man</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first combination is the active woman and a passive
man who make a bad combination in Proverbs 7. Other examples include Adam and
Eve in Genesis 3, Abraham and Sarah in Genesis 16, and Ahab and Jezebel in 1
Kings 19. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And behold, a woman comes to meet him, Dressed as a harlot and
cunning of heart. She is boisterous and rebellious, Her feet do not remain at
home;” (Proverbs 7:10-11, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“For at the window of my house I looked out through my lattice,
And I saw among the naive, And discerned among the youths A young man lacking
sense,” (Proverbs 7:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways, Do not stray
into her paths. For many are the victims she has cast down, And numerous are
all her slain. Her house is the way to Sheol, Descending to the chambers of
death.” (Proverbs 7:25-27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that
it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one wise,
she took from its fruit and ate; and she gave also to her husband with her, and
he ate.” (Genesis 3:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So Sarai said to Abram, &quot;Now behold, the LORD has
prevented me from bearing children. Please go in to my maid; perhaps I will
obtain children through her.&quot; And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.
After Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, Abram's wife Sarai took
Hagar the Egyptian, her maid, and gave her to her husband Abram as his wife. He
went in to Hagar, and she conceived; and when she saw that she had conceived,
her mistress was despised in her sight.” (Genesis 16:2-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and how he had
killed all the prophets with the sword. Then Jezebel sent a messenger to
Elijah, saying, &quot;So may the gods do to me and even more, if I do not make
your life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time.&quot; And he
was afraid and arose and ran for his life and came to Beersheba, which belongs
to Judah, and left his servant there.” (1 Kings 19:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The second combination is the active woman and an active
man. Examples include Potiphar’s wife and Joseph in Genesis 39:6-7, Solomon and
Shulammite Woman in Song of Solomon, David and Bathsheba in 1 Samuel 11 and 1
Kings 1, Aquila and Priscilla in Romans 16:3, and Zacharias and Elizabeth in
Luke 1. </p>

<p class=Verses>“So he left everything he owned in Joseph's charge; and with
him there he did not concern himself with anything except the food which he
ate. Now Joseph was handsome in form and appearance. It came about after these
events that his master's wife looked with desire at Joseph, and she said,
&quot;Lie with me.&quot;” (Genesis 39:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Greet Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus,”
(Romans 16:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named
Zacharias, of the division of Abijah; and he had a wife from the daughters of
Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.” (Luke 1:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the angel said to him, &quot;Do not be afraid, Zacharias,
for your petition has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son,
and you will give him the name John.” (Luke 1:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The angel answered and said to her, &quot;The Holy Spirit will
come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; and for that
reason the holy Child shall be called the Son of God.” (Luke 1:35, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The third combination is the passive woman and an active
man. The example is Job and his wife in Job 1 and Job 2. </p>

<p class=Verses>“He said, &quot;Naked I came from my mother's womb, And naked I
shall return there. The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away. Blessed be the
name of the LORD.&quot; Through all this Job did not sin nor did he blame God.”
(Job 1:21-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Satan went out from the presence of the LORD and smote
Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head. And he
took a potsherd to scrape himself while he was sitting among the ashes. Then
his wife said to him, &quot;Do you still hold fast your integrity? Curse God
and die!&quot; But he said to her, &quot;You speak as one of the foolish women
speaks. Shall we indeed accept good from God and not accept adversity?&quot; In
all this Job did not sin with his lips.” (Job 2:7-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fourth combination is the passive woman, passive man.
The ideal balance is found in Proverbs 31. See the category on <a
href="#_Adam’s_Rib">Adam’s Rib.</a> </p>

<p class=Verses>“An excellent wife, who can find? For her worth is far above
jewels. The heart of her husband trusts in her, And he will have no lack of
gain.” (Proverbs 31:10-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The man is designed to be an initiator and the woman is
designed to be a responder. However, the man can reverse roles and become a
responder and the woman can become an initiator. In a time of apostacy, the
woman is always predominately the aggressor and the man the responder. 1 Peter
3:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“In the same way, you wives, be submissive to your own husbands
so that even if any of them are disobedient to the word, they may be won
without a word by the behavior of their wives,” (1 Peter 3:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A rebellious woman is always frustrated, never happy, is
very critical of men in general, and dislikes dogmatic teaching. The daily face
to face teaching of Bible doctrine always motivates the man toward initiation
and the woman towards response. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The woman may be aggressive in her obedience as in 1
Peter 3:1-6 where she is beautiful in soul and beautiful in body. The proper
balance comes through the daily function of the grace apparatus for perception
and the growth to spiritual maturity.</p>

<p class=Verses>“In the same way, you wives, be submissive to your own husbands
so that even if any of them are disobedient to the word, they may be won
without a word by the behavior of their wives, as they observe your chaste and
respectful behavior. Your adornment must not be merely external—braiding the
hair, and wearing gold jewelry, or putting on dresses; but let it be the hidden
person of the heart, with the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet
spirit, which is precious in the sight of God. For in this way in former times
the holy women also, who hoped in God, used to adorn themselves, being
submissive to their own husbands; just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him
lord, and you have become her children if you do what is right without being
frightened by any fear.” (1 Peter 3:1-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Weak Man and Weak Woman in Marriage</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Weak Man </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God invented the divine institution of marriage so that
the woman would respect her husband and that the woman would respond to his
demonstrated love for her. The weak man has no grace orientation in his life.
The weak man feels threatened by Bible doctrine and rejects it. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The weak man, in his arrogance, depends on flattery and
praise from others and seeks the interest and admiration from women. Prior to
marriage, the weak man is arrogant and pursues the woman until she has no
privacy left, so she reacts and rejects him. The weak man is unfaithful before
and during marriage. He is always thinking about himself. The weak husband
bullies his wife, stifles her volition, and abuses his divinely-authorized authority
in marriage. He also bullies his children which produces fear and resentment in
them. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Weak Woman</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The weak woman is arrogant and out of fellowship. She is preoccupied
with her unrealistic expectations of her husband and when fault is discovered,
she turns on him. The weak woman rejects her role as responder to her husband
and rejects his authority in the marriage. The weak woman is negative to Bible
doctrine and does not adhere to God’s mandates in marriage. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The weak woman invades the privacy of others. She is
always trying to change others to conform to her expectations and standards.
She is legalistic in her thinking and behavior. She never tries to change
herself because she feels she already adheres to her high expectations and
standards. She sees no reason for self-improvement or changing herself in any
way.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In unconditional mental attitude <i>agapao</i> love plus
personal rapport <i>phileo</i> love, the strong woman responds to her husband
in obedience and functions in enforced and genuine humility, and objectivity
based on the <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in her soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>To Respond or To React</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Personal love for God provides the motivation for the
woman’s love in friendship, romance, and marriage. Unconditional mental
attitude love for all mankind provides the woman’s capacity for love. With this
capacity for love, she may develop respect and admiration for a man. This
capacity is a soul capacity based on the Bible doctrine in her soul. If the
woman does not make learning Bible doctrine from a pastor-teacher her top
priority in her life, she will never develop this soul capacity for true love.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The woman is more emotional than the man, but emotion is
not love. Love is expressed by thinking based on the Bible doctrine in the
soul. Getting married based on emotion is a big mistake when it is confused
with true love. Such marriages have little chance of success because they have
not taken the time to develop their love and understanding of each other from
the attraction phase into the compatibility phase based on Bible doctrine in
their souls.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A woman must be free in her soul to love a man. A woman
can only respond through respect from the Bible doctrine in the right lobe of
her soul before she can have true love for a man. The woman can only respond to
her man when he expresses and demonstrates his love. The husband is mandated to
love his wife as Christ loved the Church.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Women develop real problems when their personal love is based
on wrong priorities and values.  A woman is no better in love than her values.
Some women are incapable of having true love because of their messed up priorities
and values. The correct priorities and values are obtained only one way -
learning the Word of God. Spiritual growth will develop and renovate wrong
values and correct priorities. If the consistent intake of Bible doctrine is
made her top priority in life, then the filling of the Holy Spirit will result
in renovation of her thinking just as it does for the man.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The woman is at her feminine best with all of the glory
and majesty of her inner beauty, when she is able to respond. If she does not
have something to which to respond, she is going to react in one of two ways
unless she is filled with the Holy Spirit and growing in Bible doctrine via the
grace apparatus for perception. She may become bitter and frustrated and nag
her husband. She may practice some form of escapism, such as bucking for an
office in a woman’s club, drinking, gambling etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>People are given the instinct to love, but their old sin
nature distorts that instinct and perverts it. Love is a tremendous source of
strength in the adversities and difficulties of life. It is practical as well
as idealistic. When two people know the real meaning of love, they do not pick
each other to pieces in front of others. They do not sulk and seek to hurt each
other and become competitive. The interrelationship between husband and wife
must be one of cooperation rather than one of competition.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In a normal marriage, no wife really wants to dominate
her husband. She prefers to be married to a husband whom she can respect, who
is mature and assumes the necessary leadership responsibilities of family life
and who is considerate of her opinions whenever facing a decision. The man is
the head of the home. This does not mean that the wife has no rights. She has
her rightful place in the home and it should be a place of honor, not a place
of degradation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is the Savior of the Body of Christ (the
Church) and the husband is the protector and guardian of the woman’s body, both
physically and mentally. A woman’s health and attitudes depend upon how she
responds to her husband. The man is also the guardian of the woman’s soul. The
woman who has something to which to respond can makes a career of loving such a
man. Such a man who is loved by such a woman is thrice blessed. Prov. 18:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He who finds a wife finds a good thing And obtains favor from
the LORD.” (Proverbs 18:22, NASB)</p>
