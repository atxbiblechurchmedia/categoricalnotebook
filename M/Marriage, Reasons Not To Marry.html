<h2>Marriage, Reasons Not To Marry</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Falling in love is not always rational. People often
marry when judgment is null and void. It’s important, therefore, to absorb
principles of application of Bible doctrine before you become emotionally
involved. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If you are a believer, do not marry an unbeliever. If you
become a believer while married to an unbeliever, this is not a biblical basis
for a divorce. You have the opportunity to evangelize your spouse and
demonstrate the spiritual life by what you say and by your actions. 1 Cor. 9:5;
2 Cor. 6:14-15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do we not have a right to take along a believing wife, even as
the rest of the apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas?” (1
Corinthians 9:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do not be bound together with unbelievers; for what
partnership have righteousness and lawlessness, or what fellowship has light
with darkness? Or what harmony has Christ with Belial, or what has a believer
in common with an unbeliever?” (2 Corinthians 6:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If you are positive to Bible doctrine, do not marry a
person who is negative to doctrine or your biblical convictions. Spiritual
compatibility is the only hope for resolving many of the problems in marriage.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Do not marry on a wave of libido to fulfill sexual
desires during the attraction stage as you have not spent enough time with your
opposite number to get to know what is in their soul. This is especially
problematic for teenage marriages. Sex is not love. Sex is only one of the many
manifestations of love. Love is a mental attitude of unconditional <i>agapao</i>
love plus a soul or rapport <i>phileo</i> love. When you magnify sex out of its
proper perspective, you ignore spiritual compatibility and the priority of
Bible doctrine and economic compatibility. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/KL/Libido.html">Libido</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Don’t marry until you both can agree on how money will be
handled. Don’t marry until you have moved from the attraction phase into the
compatibility phase of your relationship. You should have recreational and
mental compatibility before marriage.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Do not marry because of social pressure. Take your time
and avoid making a very big mistake that will have long-term consequences. Don’t
marry because you want children. Children do not improve a marriage, nor do
they ever save a marriage.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Don’t marry someone for their outward beauty or
attractiveness alone. Outward beauty provides very little indication of the
real character and soul content of a person. Outward beauty or attractiveness can
hide flaws and defects of character. These need to be recognized before
marriage.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Don’t marry to solve problems. Marriage is never the
solution to the problems of life. Marriage actually creates more problems that
when single. Problems must be solved prior to marriage. If you cannot solve
your problems while alone, you cannot solve them in marriage. The only way to
solve problems is with divine solutions through learning and applying Bible
doctrine. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Don’t marry to escape from an unhappy home life, abusive
parents, or an unhappy set of circumstances. Don’t marry someone just because
they have money to improve your economic situation or for financial security. Also,
you should not go into debt to get married.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Do not believe that two people can live as cheaply as one
person. Don’t marry a status symbol or someone famous as they usually carry a
lot of “baggage” that you will become involved with. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Do not marry a divorced person except under bona fide
biblical conditions. Those conditions are;     their former spouse has died, or
they divorced their spouse prior to accepting Jesus Christ as their Savior, or
their former spouse has remarried, or they are the innocent party of a divorce
due to adultery, or their divorce involved the desertion by their former
spouse.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Don’t marry when you are too young. Teenage marriages
have a very bad track record. Take the time to learn about each other’s
character, beliefs, and what is in their souls. Do not marry because you think
you will never have another chance. Do not marry because of pregnancy. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Women should not get married until they understand the
principle that in marriage they lose some of their freedom. They must realize
that they are surrendering both their soul and their body to one man, both as
long as they both shall life. The husband must be willing to assume leadership
authority and associated responsibilities and should be careful to treat his
wife with love with the proper mental attitude.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Women should not marry any man unless they can submit to
his spiritual authority, his mental authority, his physical authority. The
mental and spiritual are far more important than the physical. Do not marry
with the attitude that if things don’t “work out” that that you can get out of
it easily. Marriage is a Divine Institution. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Do not marry a person because they are sympathetic to you
when you are in a period of high stress. This is the “any port in a storm”
scenario. Do not marry someone addicted to gambling, drugs, or alcohol. Don’t
marry a person you find to be continually jealous or one who has an overly
inflated sense of themselves. </p>
