<h2>Marriage, Premarital Sex </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Premarital sex and post-marital sex are both considered fornication
and are defined as voluntary sexual intercourse between two unmarried persons.
Adultery is defined as voluntary sexual intercourse of a married person with
someone other than their spouse. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is a definite biblical prohibition of sexual
relations before marriage and scar tissue on the soul is the reason. This is
contrary to most everything we are taught today. Parents should teach sex
education, not the schools. When parents surrender this responsibility to the
schools, they are out of line. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is not trying to deprive you of fun when He mandates
no sex before marriage. He is protecting you and protecting the right one you
will marry. He is protecting you so you will have a life of fulfillment in
marriage. Don’t tamper with sex until the right time. Then, in marriage, you
will have inner happiness with whom God has given you. Heb. 13:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“ Make sure that your character is free from the love of money,
being content with what you have; for He Himself has said, “I WILL NEVER DESERT
YOU, NOR WILL I EVER FORSAKE YOU,”“  (Hebrews 13:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Fornication is a woman using her physical responses by
destroying her soul responses, therefore, destroying herself. She becomes
incapable of true love. In Galatians 5:19, “sensuality” refers to the lust for
sexual stimulation of the body.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are: immorality,
impurity, sensuality,” (Galatians 5:19, NASB)                                       </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Word of God is very clear in God's prohibition of
premarital sex and post-marital sex (fornication). 1 Cor. 6:13; Acts 15:20;
Acts 15:29; Acts 21:25; 1 Cor. 5:1; 1 Cor. 7:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Food is for the stomach and the stomach is for food, but God
will do away with both of them. Yet the body is not for immorality, but for the
Lord, and the Lord is for the body.” (1 Corinthians 6:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“but that we write to them that they abstain from things
contaminated by idols and from fornication and from what is strangled and from
blood.” (Acts 15:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols and from
blood and from things strangled and from fornication; if you keep yourselves
free from such things, you will do well. Farewell.&quot;” (Acts 15:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“It is actually reported that there is immorality among you,
and immorality of such a kind as does not exist even among the Gentiles, that
someone has his father's wife.” (1 Corinthians 5:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But because of immoralities, each man is to have his own wife,
and each woman is to have her own husband.” (1 Corinthians 7:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In romance, there is always the risk of violating the
biblical warnings against premarital sex. Sexual intimacy in the attraction
stage of romance and courtship destroys a relationship because God's design for
a man and woman to reach the compatibility phase of their relationship and
marriage before engaging in sex. The compatibility phase involves exploring how
a person thinks, discovering what they really are, seeing their dark side under
stress, seeing their good side under the right conditions, and confirming their
flaws. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Couples who choose premarital sex have given up the norms
and standards of Bible doctrine by which compatibility can be attained with the
opposite sex in favor of emotional revolt of the soul. Premarital sex and
emotional revolt of the soul destroy the foundation for both romance and a
successful marriage.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To have a successful marriage, the believer is mandated
to avoid those who are involved in fornication whether believer or unbeliever.
Fornication also brings divine discipline for the believer. 1 Thess. 4:3-4; 1
Cor. 5:11; Heb. 13:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this is the will of God, your sanctification; that is,
that you abstain from sexual immorality; that each of you know how to possess
his own vessel in sanctification and honor,” (1 Thessalonians 4:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But actually, I wrote to you not to associate with any
so-called brother if he is an immoral person, or covetous, or an idolater, or a
reviler, or a drunkard, or a swindler—not even to eat with such a one.” (1
Corinthians 5:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Marriage is to be held in honor among all, and the marriage
bed is to be undefiled; for fornicators and adulterers God will judge.”
(Hebrews 13:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The man involved in premarital sex cannot perform
adequately and the woman involved in premarital sex is always thinking of
someone else who did it better. Premarital sex is usually all about
self-gratification. Both men and women enter into premarital sex simply to
satisfy their own sexual urges. There is no genuine love or sense of
responsibility for their sex partner in fornication. This is especially true of
men. For these men, the woman is simply his object of self-gratification. This
may be true also for the promiscuous female seeking a man to fulfill her sexual
desires. This leads to nothing but frustration for both the man and the woman.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Marriage is more than just finding the right one for you.
Marriage is about being the right kind of person. Premarital sex eliminates
being the right kind of person, so that finding the right one for you is filled
with regrets.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Premarital sex can result in an erotic self-gratification
that seeks sexual sensation above a true love relationship. Premarital sex is
sin against your own body. The physiological factor in sexual arousal involves
biological rapport as well as mental, soulish, and spiritual rapport.
Premarital sex destroys the level of biological rapport possible between the
husband and wife in marriage. This means that premarital sex decreases the
source of sexual energy in marriage and may lead to the feeling that sex has
become dull. 1 Cor. 6:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Flee immorality. Every other sin that a man commits is outside
the body, but the immoral man sins against his own body.” (1 Corinthians 6:18,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The more premarital sex partners one has, the more
difficult it is to adjust to one person in marriage. Each premarital sexual
relationship tends to be conditioned to the response pattern of the one you are
with and becomes a composite from many. The pattern of effective sexual
relationship in marriage may have been damaged. The recovery process for this
situation is from the grace of God whereby the believer recovers from the
destructive effects of premarital sex by confessing known sins to God the Father
and return to the intake of Bible doctrine. Spiritual growth is the only way to
correct or renew your thinking in life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Recovery From Premarital Sex</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The recovery process from premarital sex for the
unbeliever, is salvation by faith alone in Jesus Christ alone. This removes all
scar tissue in the soul. Then after salvation, the new believer should find a
local church that teaches Bible doctrine and get the Word daily and grow
spiritually.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The recovery process from premarital sex for the believer
starts with the Word of God, a local church that is true to the Word of God,
and a pastor-teacher that categorically opens up the Word. Confess or cite in
prayer your known sins to God the Father using 1 John 1:9. </p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sin does not make you lose your salvation, it has
temporarily removed your fellowship with the Lord. In naming the sins, your
fellowship is always restored because God is always faithful. Tell the Lord you
want your deficiency of soul filled up with His wisdom. James 1:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives
to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him.” (James
1:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Go on a crash program of Bible doctrine basics. Let go of
your social life. It’s what got you into trouble anyway. Turn to the Word of
God. The more of the Word you get into your soul, the more you can handle your
social life. See category on <a href="#_Basic_Bible_Doctrines">Basic Bible
Doctrines</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The application of the <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine
from the right lobe of the soul with its frame of reference removes scar
tissue. Although getting into fellowship via 1 John 1:9 does not remove scar
tissue, it keeps more scar tissue from forming.</p>
