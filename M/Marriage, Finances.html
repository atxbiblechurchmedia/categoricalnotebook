<h2><a name="_D-Marriage,_Finances"></a>Marriage, Finances</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Wife’s Role in Finances</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The traditional wife is a household manager including
being the foreman of the kitchen and managing the smooth operation of the
activities surrounding the home. An owner of property is called a householder
in Scripture. The owner is the administrator of the property, personnel, land,
equipment, and oversees it. The property owner may be the husband or the wife or
they may jointly own the property. In Matthew 20:1, “landowner” is <span
lang=EL>οι</span>̓<span lang=EL>κοδεσπο</span>́<span lang=EL>της</span>
(oikodespotēs) and means master of the house, the landowner, the head of the
house. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went
out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.” (Matthew 20:1,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 13:25, “head of the house” is also <span lang=EL>οι</span>̓<span
lang=EL>κοδεσπο</span>́<span lang=EL>της</span> (oikodespotēs), but refers to
the Lord Jesus Christ as being the door to salvation. It is used again in a
protective and supervisory capacity. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Once the head of the house gets up and shuts the door,
and you begin to stand outside and knock on the door, saying, 'Lord, open up to
us!' then He will answer and say to you, 'I do not know where you are from.'”
(Luke 13:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Timothy 5:14, “keep house” is the verb form of <span
lang=EL>οι</span>̓<span lang=EL>κοδεσποτε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(oikodespoteō) and refers to the woman being the guide of the house. She keeps
on being the administrator of the house and she rules it. This is explained in
Proverbs 31. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, I want younger widows to get married, bear
children, keep house, and give the enemy no occasion for reproach;” (1 Timothy
5:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To administer the household, her husband entrusts her
with part of the pay check. Prov. 31:11. </p>

<p class=Verses>“The heart of her husband trusts in her, And he will have no
lack of gain.” (Proverbs 31:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>She uses her volition to get the commodities and other
supplies as required. Prov. 31:16; Prov. 31:18; Prov. 31:27. </p>

<p class=Verses>“She considers a field and buys it; From her earnings she
plants a vineyard.” (Proverbs 31:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“She senses that her gain is good; Her lamp does not go out at
night.” (Proverbs 31:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“She looks well to the ways of her household, And does not eat
the bread of idleness.” (Proverbs 31:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>She is responsible for clothing the family. Prov. 31:13; Prov.
31:21-22; Prov. 31:24.</p>

<p class=Verses>“She looks for wool and flax And works with her hands in
delight.” (Proverbs 31:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“She is not afraid of the snow for her household, For all her
household are clothed with scarlet. She makes coverings for herself; Her
clothing is fine linen and purple.” (Proverbs 31:21-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“She makes linen garments and sells them, And supplies belts to
the tradesmen.” (Proverbs 31:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The wife often contributes to the income of a household
even though the small children are in the home. However, here she works in the
home, not a factory. Prov. 31:28.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Her children rise up and bless her; Her husband also, and he
praises her, saying:” (Proverbs 31:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>She is responsible for preparing the meals of the family,
which isn’t an easy task. Prov. 31:15. </p>

<p class=Verses>“She rises also while it is still night And gives food to her
household And portions to her maidens.” (Proverbs 31:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>She is also responsible for tending and teaching the
children. She is entitled to an adequate supply of money for fulfilling her
responsibilities. The husband is to see that she is not short on the money to
fulfill her responsibilities. 1 Tim. 5:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for
those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an
unbeliever.” (1 Timothy 5:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Many marital conflicts develop in this area. She is
entitled to discuss the financial situation in the home and lend practical
stability to it. 1 Peter 5:7. </p>

<p class=Verses>“casting all your anxiety on Him, because He cares for you.” (1
Peter 5:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Too many men neglect the areas of food, shelter and
clothing and tie up household finance with purchase of automobiles,
motorcycles, gadgets, and guns. Financially, a family is either too tight or
too spendthrift. The wife is entitled to help control the impulse buying spree
that some men are capable of or vice versa. 1 Tim. 6:7. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For we have brought nothing into the world, so we cannot take
anything out of it either.” (1 Timothy 6:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The wife can go to a supermarket and spend money for
groceries and the husband can be critical. Conversely, the husband may do the
same thing and spend even more and justify himself. This is not how it is
supposed to work. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Husband’s Role in Finances</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The husband is very often the primary provider for the
household in marriage. Gen. 3:17-19; 1 Tim. 5:8. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then to Adam He said, &quot;Because you have listened to the
voice of your wife, and have eaten from the tree about which I commanded you,
saying, 'You shall not eat from it'; Cursed is the ground because of you; In
toil you will eat of it All the days of your life. &quot;Both thorns and
thistles it shall grow for you; And you will eat the plants of the field; By
the sweat of your face You will eat bread, Till you return to the ground,
Because from it you were taken; For you are dust, And to dust you shall
return.&quot;” (Genesis 3:17-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for
those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an
unbeliever.” (1 Timothy 5:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The husband’s responsibility is to balance his work hours
with the time needed to be the father of the children and the husband of his
wife. Some think their work is so important that it takes all of their time to
the detriment of their marriage and family. 1 Tim. 6:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and constant friction between men of depraved mind and
deprived of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a means of gain.” (1
Timothy 6:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He is to keep his nose out of the kitchen and can only
operate there with his wife’s permission. His place is in the “gates” referring
to work outside the home. Prov. 31:23. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Her husband is known in the gates, When he sits among the
elders of the land.” (Proverbs 31:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He is to encourage her in her household activities. The
husband is to value very highly his wife’s judgment and her administration of
household affairs. A critical, scathing, denouncing outburst by a husband in
the area of the wife’s activities is never warranted! Prov. 31:11; Prov. 31:28;
Prov. 31:30.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The heart of her husband trusts in her, And he will have no
lack of gain.” (Proverbs 31:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Her children rise up and bless her; Her husband also, and he
praises her, saying:” (Proverbs 31:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Charm is deceitful and beauty is vain, But a woman who fears
the LORD, she shall be praised.” (Proverbs 31:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He is responsible to understand her and protect her. 1
Peter 3:7. </p>

<p class=Verses>“You husbands in the same way, live with your wives in an
understanding way, as with someone weaker, since she is a woman; and show her
honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life, so that your prayers will not be
hindered.” (1 Peter 3:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He who chews out his wife bites himself and only a
jackass would do that. Eph. 5:28-29. </p>

<p class=Verses>“So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own
bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself; for no one ever hated his own
flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also does the church,”
(Ephesians 5:28-29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He is to respect her privacy and her volition. The
husband is never to coerce, force, bully, or order her in areas of finance. He
is to allow her the liberty of making decisions, encourage her to use her
volition as much as possible in household management.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A wife should not have to give an account of everything
she spends to the very last cent. She should be allowed freedom in choice of
gifts for anniversaries, birthdays, and showers. She should not have to be
reduced to sneaking around to do things she wants to do. Nor should she be
afraid what her husband will do if he found out. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Financial Stability and Debt</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Debt and the Believer </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A married man is to not slight his family with the basics
of food, shelter, and clothing. 1 Tim. 5:8. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for
those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an
unbeliever.” (1 Timothy 5:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>High interest loans should be avoided as much as
possible, but is acceptable under some conditions. Deut. 23:19-20; Prov. 28:8;
Rom. 13:8; Neh. 5. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You shall not charge interest to your countrymen:
interest on money, food, or anything that may be loaned at interest. &quot;You
may charge interest to a foreigner, but to your countrymen you shall not charge
interest, so that the LORD your God may bless you in all that you undertake in
the land which you are about to enter to possess.” (Deuteronomy 23:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He who increases his wealth by interest and usury Gathers it
for him who is gracious to the poor.” (Proverbs 28:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Owe nothing to anyone except to love one another; for he who
loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law.” (Romans 13:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Credit should be established, but should not be abused.
Keep short account of debts and where you stand. If money is short, make your
needs known to the Father in prayer. Phil. 4:19. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And my God will supply all your needs according to His riches
in glory in Christ Jesus.” (Philippians 4:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The family should be prepared for economic downturns, even
severe recession or depression. Job 5:19. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;From six troubles He will deliver you, Even in seven
evil will not touch you.” (Job 5:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Financial Stability </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the soul plus the
filling of the Holy Spirit produces inner happiness and contentment. You carry
your happiness with you. Details are controlled and enjoyed. With no doctrine in
the soul and no filling of the Holy Spirit, you will always want, but not be
satisfied. Prov. 30:15-16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The leech has two daughters, &quot;Give,&quot;
&quot;Give.&quot; There are three things that will not be satisfied, Four that
will not say, &quot;Enough&quot;: Sheol, and the barren womb, Earth that is
never satisfied with water, And fire that never says, &quot;Enough.&quot;”
(Proverbs 30:15-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ecclesiastes, the richest man in the world tried to
achieve happiness with the details of life, never being satisfied. Education
does not satisfy when the believer is out of fellowship. Eccl. 1:17-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And I set my mind to know wisdom and to know madness and
folly; I realized that this also is striving after wind. Because in much wisdom
there is much grief, and increasing knowledge results in increasing pain.”
(Ecclesiastes 1:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Pleasure and self-indulgence do not satisfy. Eccl.
2:1-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Thus I considered all my activities which my hands had done
and the labor which I had exerted, and behold all was vanity and striving after
wind and there was no profit under the sun.” (Ecclesiastes 2:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Preparing for children does not satisfy. Eccl. 2:18-19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Thus I hated all the fruit of my labor for which I had labored
under the sun, for I must leave it to the man who will come after me. And who
knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will have control over
all the fruit of my labor for which I have labored by acting wisely under the
sun. This too is vanity.” (Ecclesiastes 2:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Philosophy does not satisfy. Eccl. 3:19-22. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For the fate of the sons of men and the fate of beasts is the
same. As one dies so dies the other; indeed, they all have the same breath and
there is no advantage for man over beast, for all is vanity. All go to the same
place. All came from the dust and all return to the dust. Who knows that the
breath of man ascends upward and the breath of the beast descends downward to
the earth? I have seen that nothing is better than that man should be happy in
his activities, for that is his lot. For who will bring him to see what will
occur after him?” (Ecclesiastes 3:19-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Evolution and fatalism do not satisfy. Eccl. 3:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the fate of the sons of men and the fate of beasts is the
same. As one dies so dies the other; indeed, they all have the same breath and
there is no advantage for man over beast, for all is vanity.” (Ecclesiastes
3:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Universalism, Agnosticism, Humanism, and humanitarianism
do not satisfy. Eccl. 3:20-22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“All go to the same place. All came from the dust and all
return to the dust. Who knows that the breath of man ascends upward and the
breath of the beast descends downward to the earth? I have seen that nothing is
better than that man should be happy in his activities, for that is his lot.
For who will bring him to see what will occur after him?” (Ecclesiastes
3:20-22, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Money does not satisfy. Ecclesiastes 5:10 - Ecclesiastes
6:2. Money and poverty have their dangers. However, a lot of money makes for a
complicated life. Some of the rich cannot sleep. The rich can get too fat. Eccl.
5:11-12. </p>

<p class=Verses>“When good things increase, those who consume them increase. So
what is the advantage to their owners except to look on? The sleep of the
working man is pleasant, whether he eats little or much; but the full stomach
of the rich man does not allow him to sleep.” (Ecclesiastes 5:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Hoarding money with inability to ever want to spent it is
a problem for some. Eccl. 5:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“There is a grievous evil which I have seen under the sun:
riches being hoarded by their owner to his hurt.” (Ecclesiastes 5:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The rich may have their money tied up in lawsuits. Eccl.
6:1-2. </p>

<p class=Verses>“There is an evil which I have seen under the sun and it is
prevalent among men— a man to whom God has given riches and wealth and honor so
that his soul lacks nothing of all that he desires; yet God has not empowered
him to eat from them, for a foreigner enjoys them. This is vanity and a severe
affliction.” (Ecclesiastes 6:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A good reputation among men does not satisfy. Eccl. 7:1;
Eccl. 7:20. </p>

<p class=Verses>“A good name is better than a good ointment, And the day of
one's death is better than the day of one's birth.” (Ecclesiastes 7:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Indeed, there is not a righteous man on earth who continually
does good and who never sins.” (Ecclesiastes 7:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sex does not satisfy. Eccl. 7:28-29; 1 Kings 11:1-8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“which I am still seeking but have not found. I have found one
man among a thousand, but I have not found a woman among all these.
&quot;Behold, I have found only this, that God made men upright, but they have
sought out many devices.&quot;” (Ecclesiastes 7:28-29, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred
concubines, and his wives turned his heart away.” (1 Kings 11:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Solomon wanted the Shulammite Woman, but she would not
have him. Song of Solomon. The thousand Solomon’s wives had scar tissue on
their souls and could not satisfy him. Eccl. 8:10-14. </p>

<p class=Verses>“There is futility which is done on the earth, that is, there
are righteous men to whom it happens according to the deeds of the wicked. On
the other hand, there are evil men to whom it happens according to the deeds of
the righteous. I say that this too is futility.” (Ecclesiastes 8:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Achievement of a standard of values does not satisfy.
Eccl. 9. Conversely, sloppy living doesn’t satisfy either. Eccl. 10. The answer
is that while alive, find what really satisfies. Eccl. 9:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For whoever is joined with all the living, there is hope;
surely a live dog is better than a dead lion.” (Ecclesiastes 9:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Zero in on the Lord Jesus Christ. Eccl. 12:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth, before
the evil days come and the years draw near when you will say, &quot;I have no
delight in them&quot;;” (Ecclesiastes 12:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is the Creator. Col. 1:16; Heb. 1:10; John
1:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For by Him all things were created, both in the heavens and on
earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or
authorities—all things have been created through Him and for Him.” (Colossians
1:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And, &quot;YOU, LORD, IN THE BEGINNING LAID THE FOUNDATION OF
THE EARTH, AND THE HEAVENS ARE THE WORKS OF YOUR HANDS;” (Hebrews 1:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him
nothing came into being that has come into being.” (John 1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Know death for what it is. Eccl. 12:3-7. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Remember Him before the silver cord is broken and the golden
bowl is crushed, the pitcher by the well is shattered and the wheel at the
cistern is crushed; then the dust will return to the earth as it was, and the
