<h2>Marriage, Failure In Marriage</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Marriage is simultaneously the most challenging
relationship in life and potentially the most fulfilling. Marriage was designed
by God for the human race with mandates to make the marriage successful.
Because marriage is a divine institution, God designed it for both believers
and unbelievers. He also designed marriage to be very successful, especially
between two believers. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God established responsibilities to make marriage
successful. The first responsibility of marriage is for the husband to love his
wife. The second responsibility of marriage is for the wife to obey her
husband. The third responsibility of marriage is for the husband and the wife
to forgive each other. We all have sin natures, so when we give in to the
pressures and temptations of our sin natures, marriages can encounter troubles
that can lead to failure.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>No relationships in life are more dramatic than the
relationship between the man and woman in marriage or between parents and
children. What you have made highest priority in your life will determine the
status of your marriage. If the consistent intake of Bible doctrine teaching is
the number one priority of both husband and wife, that marriage has the highest
potential for long-term success and happiness in life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Why Do Marriages Fail? </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Marriages fail because the husband and wife first fail in
their spiritual lives. Marriages fail because believers think that marriage
will be a state of happiness. If they have been unhappy all of their lives,
they look to marriage to create happiness. Many believers marry with
unrealistic expectations, illusions, and myths that marriage will make their
problems go away. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Where there is a marital failure, there is usually a
mental attitude lacking in the husband. When believers have problems in their
marriage, the husband (who holds 51% of the stock) had better hold a
stockholders meeting and find out with their wife what to do about the
situation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Marriages fail because people get married for the wrong
reasons. Many get married for security, for legalized sex, because of peer
pressure, because of unrealistic expectations, to escape from unpleasant
circumstances, or even for a meal ticket. Marriages fail because people are
failures as human beings. Believers are no better in marriage than they are as
people. Marriages fail because believers marry for the wrong reasons resulting
in them marring the wrong person.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Marriages fail because believers do not obey the mandates
of 1 Corinthians 7:3. God invented marriage and the duties that go with
marriage. It is much easier to learn the duties before marriage from spiritual
growth than to get married and have to learn the rules of marriage.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The husband must fulfill his duty to his wife, and likewise
also the wife to her husband.” (1 Corinthians 7:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Marriages fail because believers get married believing
that marriage will solve their problems, not realizing that marriage always
makes their problems worse and even generates new problems. Some expect the
other spouse to solve the problems they brought into the marriage.  They try to
unload their problems on each other. They are also completely unprepared
spiritually to handle their disappointments, frustrations, and
disillusionments.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Marriages fail because believers make bad decisions while
out of fellowship or because they have rejected Bible doctrine and are in
reversionism. Marriages fail because the husband or wife try to change the
other person. Marriages fail because they believed the misconception that
children will save a marriage.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Man was designed to have sex with one woman in marriage.
Premarital sex destroys marriage and the biblical love needed for marriage and
romance. Eccl. 7:25-29.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I directed my mind to know, to investigate and to seek wisdom
and an explanation, and to know the evil of folly and the foolishness of
madness. And I discovered more bitter than death the woman whose heart is
snares and nets, whose hands are chains. One who is pleasing to God will escape
from her, but the sinner will be captured by her. &quot;Behold, I have
discovered this,&quot; says the Preacher, &quot;adding one thing to another to
find an explanation, which I am still seeking but have not found. I have found
one man among a thousand, but I have not found a woman among all these.
&quot;Behold, I have found only this, that God made men upright, but they have
sought out many devices.&quot;” (Ecclesiastes 7:25-29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The man looking for the right kind of woman to marry
should first grow spiritually so that he will become the right kind of man that
the woman would want to marry. Looking for premarital sex guarantees that you
are not the right kind of man. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Marriages fail because of the arrogance of unhappiness.
The woman and the man are both capable of this. The arrogance of unhappiness
seeks to control others by making them feel guilty for alleged neglect, thus
gaining attention through guilt. This also results in attention given to your
self-pity by trying to get others to feel sorry for you.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You cannot build happiness on pleasant environment or the
details of life, such as money, success, power, pleasure, sex, approbation,
social life, friends, health, or marriage. You cannot build your happiness on
self-gratification, drug abuse, beauty, sex, or attractiveness.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You cannot build your happiness on someone else’s
unhappiness. Happiness does not arrive in a moment of time, a moment of
pleasure, a moment of power, a moment of success, or a moment of stimulation.
Marriage cannot make you happy. Only <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the
right lobe of your soul under the filling of the Holy Spirit can produce true
happiness.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Life’s relationships must be based on principle. For the marriage
of two believers to continue and grow, there must be an understanding of the
principles of Bible doctrine. You cannot build a marriage on human viewpoint,
practical humanistic ideals, or secular philosophy. You must learn and apply
biblical principles.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>No marriage will grow or even survive without unconditional
mental attitude love. This is because no believer can advance to spiritual maturity
without unconditional love. This can only be developed through the renewing of
your thinking from Bible doctrine in the soul and the filling of the Holy
Spirit. Rom. 12:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by
the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that
which is good and acceptable and perfect.” (Romans 12:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>From unconditional love comes true personal love for your
spouse. Personal love in marriage depends upon the stability of unconditional
mental attitude love based on your own divine viewpoint thinking when problems
are encountered or when your spouse is not acting as you wished and may have
even disappointed you. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As the husband and wife age, the outward attractiveness
of each begins to fade. Flaws that were hidden by youth and attractiveness
become manifest as we age. In a good marriage, as the two people grow older and
become less attractive, the relationship becomes sweeter and more resilient.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Why the First Marriage Failed</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first marriage of Adam and the woman in the Garden of
Eden failed because of rejection of the divine wisdom taught them daily by none
other than the Lord Jesus Christ. Adam and the woman both had free will in
their souls and were responsible for their own decisions just as we all are in
the human race. The woman thought that she would be happier and more fulfilled
by greater knowledge. Adam thought he would be happier with a sinful woman than
without her.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The woman wanted more than what she had in the perfect
Garden and more knowledge than what she was being taught by our Lord. The Lord
Jesus Christ taught the woman and gave her the knowledge she needed, but that
knowledge was not enough for her. She had deceived herself long before the
serpent deceived her into sinning. It did not take much effort for Satan to
deceive her. She had convinced herself in her dialogue with Satan that the
knowledge of good and evil would make her happier than she was.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The woman believed the serpent’s lies because this is
what she wanted to hear. As a responder and in a state of reaction or rejection
of her husband’s authority, the woman wanted to hear certain things. The
Satan-possessed serpent simply told her what she wanted to hear and thus deceived
her.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>She was free to decide for or against God's single
prohibition in the Garden. She decided against God’s mandate and sinned. At
that instant, she became spiritually dead. Adam was standing beside Eve when
she first sinned by eating the fruit. Gen 3:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that
it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one wise,
she took from its fruit and ate; and she gave also to her husband with her, and
he ate.” (Genesis 3:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Adam looked at his wife as the first sinner and was also
free to decide for or against God's single prohibition in the Garden. Adam also
decided against God’s mandate and sinned. He chose his wife in her spiritual
death over remaining in fellowship with the Lord Jesus Christ. Adam knew he
could only remain with her through his own spiritual death, so he followed her
in sin. He had rejected all of the Bible doctrine in his soul when he sinned.
He chose fellowship with her in sin over all of the spiritual norms and
standards of Bible doctrine he had learned.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>By application, when you compromise or reject the Bible doctrine
in your soul to have rapport with friends, then you have lost the basis for
true happiness in life. Rapport with God is infinitely more important than
rapport with people, even in the most intimate relationship of husband and
wife. If you have not developed rapport with God through spiritual growth, you
will never be happy in life.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has designed our spiritual life to be a system of
thinking. Your thinking is either within the spiritual life with the Holy
Spirit controlling your soul or outside the spiritual life with your old sin
nature controlling your soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first and perfect marriage failed because their
thinking became corrupted. The thinking of the woman became corrupted resulting
in her sinning in ignorance. The thinking of the man then became corrupted
resulting in his sinning knowing fully that he was rejecting God's single
prohibition. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>No matter who you are, your thinking may become
corrupted. Believers protect themselves by remaining filled with the Holy
Spirit in the spiritual life and applying <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine to
the situations and decisions in life. When you think with divine viewpoint, you
use God's grace resources to handle many of life’s problems. When you reject Bible
doctrine, your thinking becomes corrupted. The perfect marriage in the Garden failed
from corrupted thinking. Phil. 2:2-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“make my joy complete by being of the same mind, maintaining
the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose. Do nothing from
selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as
more important than yourselves; do not merely look out for your own personal
interests, but also for the interests of others. Have this attitude in
yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus,” (Philippians 2:2-5, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Mental Attitude Sins Destroy Marriage</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Most of the failures in marriage are a result of mental
attitude sins. Most people cite unfaithfulness, arguments over money, or
general personality incompatibility for failure in marriage. These are merely
symptoms and have not revealed the real root cause which is the mental attitude
of arrogance.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Arrogance leads to many other mental attitude sins such
as jealousy, bitterness, vindictiveness, anger, malice, hatred, desire for revenge,
self-pity, guilt, and hypersensitivity. These become symptoms of the real
culprit - arrogance.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>People can improve and change, but that requires that
they make the consistent learning Bible doctrine their top priority in life.
Only spiritual growth can produce the divine solutions to marital problems.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>People are no better in marriage than they are as people
in their own. An arrogant person in marriage is an arrogant person out of
marriage. Arrogance is a far greater factor than anything else in life and that
self-centeredness is the major problem. See category on <a href="#_Arrogance">Arrogance</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Bitterness in Marriage</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Bitterness is a serious mental attitude sin of emotional
arrogance. It combines arrogance with emotion that can easily cause the
believer to remain in carnality in a downward spiral of reversionism. Bitterness
destroys any possibility of a successful marriage. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Colossians 3:19, “Husbands” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span
lang=EL>νη</span>́<span lang=EL>ρ</span> (anēr) and means nobleman and refers
to the husband who must represent the concept of honor, integrity, and
nobility. “Love” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>γαπα</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (agapaō) and is a mental attitude unconditional love. You
love someone because of your character and Bible doctrine in your soul, not
because of the attractiveness of the one you love. For example, you should
still love your wife with an <i>agapao</i> love when she is not behaving
nicely. You stay in fellowship and continue to love her in spite of any
unattractive behavior or words said.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Husbands, love your wives and do not be embittered against
them.” (Colossians 3:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Do not be embittered” is <span lang=EL>πικραι</span>́<span
lang=EL>νω</span> (pikrainō) means to stop being bitter which is a sign of the
mental attitude sin of arrogance. When people are bitter they often slander,
malign, and criticize others. Bitterness is an arrogant habit of
self-centeredness that keeps you out of fellowship. Eph. 4:31.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander
be put away from you, along with all malice.” (Ephesians 4:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Bitterness is one of the worst mental attitude sins
because it turns love into hatred, happiness into malice, and blessing into
cursing. Bitterness is the fuel that produces self-justification,
self-deception, and self-absorption. When you turn to bitterness, you will
never take responsibility for the cause of your bitterness nor will you take
responsibility for your failures. Bitter people become irrational and think
they have no flaws. It’s always someone else’s fault. In Ephesians 4:31,
“bitterness” is <span lang=EL>πικρι</span>́<span lang=EL>α</span><span lang=EL>
</span>(pikria) and means bitterness, bitter hatred. This word is also used in
Hebrews 12:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“See to it that no one comes short of the grace of God; that no
root of bitterness springing up causes trouble, and by it many be defiled;”
(Hebrews 12:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ephesians 4:31, “wrath” is <span lang=EL>θυμο</span>́<span
lang=EL>ς</span> (thumos) and means passionate outbursts of anger that boil up then
subside, an angry temper. “Anger” is <span lang=EL>ο</span>̓<span lang=EL>ργη</span>́
(orgē) and means agitation of the soul, the violent emotion of anger. “Clamor”
is <span lang=EL>κραυγη</span>́ (kraugē) and means shouting, loud verbal
fighting and brawling. “Slander” is <span lang=EL>βλασφημι</span>́<span
lang=EL>α</span> (blasphēmia) and means slander, detraction, speech injurious
to another’s good name. “Malice” is <span lang=EL>κακι</span>́<span lang=EL>α</span><span
lang=EL> </span>(kakia) and means malignity, malice, ill-will, desire to
injure, depravity, wickedness that is not ashamed to break laws, and evil. Malice
is the lust to hurt someone because of your bitterness, anger, and hatred. You
seek revenge on the object of your anger, hatred, and wrath. This destroys what
is left of the marriage.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A wife becomes bitter when she is continually disappointed
with her husband. A husband becomes bitter when he is continually disappointed
with his wife and wishes he had married someone else. Bitterness is a constant
threat of mental attitude sin in the relationship. Bitterness destroys the
marriage even if neither spouse initiates divorce or separation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The divine solution to bitterness is forgiveness. Kindness
is the opposite of bitterness. If you are bitter, you are out of fellowship and
the old sin nature is in control of your soul. If you are kind, the Holy Spirit
is controlling your soul. When you are kind, you are thinking about someone
besides yourself. You are not filled with your own self-importance. Every
Christian spouse in marriage is mandated to be kind to their spouse.
Unconditional <i>agapao</i> love for all mankind is being kind. Personal love
for God the Father and personal love for a select few in your life is
exhibiting kindness. Eph. 4:32.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other,
just as God in Christ also has forgiven you.” (Ephesians 4:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If you are being tender-hearted or compassionate, you are
no longer thinking about yourself but thinking about your spouse. Compassion is
a synonym for kindness and is a mental attitude, not an emotion. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>No marriage is a successful marriage without forgiveness.
You do not forgive unless you put behind you forever the wrongs other people do
to you. You are told to forgive everyone. The motivation for this is personal
love for God the Father, not your spouse, and not your emotion.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When a person truly forgives, they truly love. There is
no love in the person who forgives and then brings that failure back up again.
Everyone will be tested at one time or another on whether their love is true or
not. True love forgives.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Husbands are commanded to have unconditional mental
attitude love for others that stabilizes the personal love they have for their wives.
It is the stability of the unconditional mental attitude <i>agapao</i> love for
others motivated by their personal love for the Lord Jesus Christ that enables
the Spirit-filled believer to forgive their spouse and others they interact
with in life. <span style='color:black'>This love in the spiritual life and
exhibited by a maturing believer is described in 1 Corinthians 13:4-7.</span></p>

<p class=Verses>“Love is patient, love is kind and is not jealous; love does
not brag and is not arrogant, does not act unbecomingly; it does not seek its
own, is not provoked, does not take into account a wrong suffered, does not
rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; bears all things,
believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.” (1 Corinthians
13:4-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>Unconditional mental attitude <i>agapao</i>
love can overlook faults, is full of trust, hope, and endurance. Personal love
is dependent on unconditional <i>agapao</i> love for its success and stability
in relationships with friends, while dating, with your family, and with your
spouse.</span> In marriage, unconditional love for others in the spiritual life
provides the capacity and power for a husband to love his wife as Christ loved
the Church and gave Himself for it, and vice versa. Eph. 5:25.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the
church and gave Himself up for her,” (Ephesians 5:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Unconditional <i>agapao</i> love for the entire human
race from the filling of the Holy Spirit stabilizes personal love in marriage
and provides the consistency, endurance, and permanence in the relationship.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Adultery Destroys Marriage</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Adultery refers to sexual relations with other partners
while married. The Word of God prohibits adultery. Exodus 20:14; Deut. 5:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>““You shall not commit adultery.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Exodus 20:14,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“‘You shall not commit adultery.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Deuteronomy 5:18,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ephesians 4:19 <span lang=EL>πλεονεξι</span>́<span
lang=EL>α</span> (pleonexia) is translated “greediness” and refers to believers
building scar tissue through adultery. Greediness can be translated “insatiable
desire.”</p>

<p class=Verses>“and they, having become callous, have given themselves over to
sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians
4:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Fornication referred to sexual relations in the heathen
temples making the sex act a form of religion. Fornication is said to “wage war
against the soul” in 1 Peter 2:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Beloved, I urge you as aliens and strangers to abstain from
fleshly lusts which wage war against the soul.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Peter 2:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Marriage protects the human race from self-destruction as
a Divine Institution. That is why God's divine discipline for adultery is so
severe. Prov. 3:12; Heb. 12:6. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For whom the LORD loves He reproves, Even as a father corrects
the son in whom he delights.” (Proverbs 3:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“FOR THOSE WHOM THE LORD LOVES HE DISCIPLINES, AND HE SCOURGES
EVERY SON WHOM HE RECEIVES.&quot;” (Hebrews 12:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Adultery is a destroyer of the soul. Prov. 6:32.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The one who commits adultery with a woman is lacking sense; He
who would destroy himself does it.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 6:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sexual love (<i>eros</i>) is sanctioned only in marriage.
1 Thess. 4:3; Heb. 13:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this is the will of God, your sanctification; that is,
that you abstain from sexual immorality;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Thessalonians 4:3,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Marriage is to be held in honor among all, and the marriage
bed is to be undefiled; for fornicators and adulterers God will judge.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews
13:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Adultery has an adverse effect on the body. Repercussions
of the soul extends into the body. 1 Cor. 6:13-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Food is for the stomach and the stomach is for food, but God
will do away with both of them. Yet the body is not for immorality, but for the
Lord, and the Lord is for the body. Now God has not only raised the Lord, but
will also raise us up through His power. Do you not know that your bodies are
members of Christ? Shall I then take away the members of Christ and make them
members of a prostitute? May it never be! Or do you not know that the one who
joins himself to a prostitute is one body with her? For He says, “THE TWO SHALL
BECOME ONE FLESH.” But the one who joins himself to the Lord is one spirit with
Him. Flee immorality. Every other sin that a man commits is outside the body,
but the immoral man sins against his own body.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians
6:13-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The result of adultery is sex frustration and a frantic
scramble for sexual experience. This can cause nymphomania, frigidity, etc.
However, the principle goes beyond adultery and into mental attitude sins.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scar tissue on the soul leads to a frantic search for
happiness in all of the details of life. For the believer minus Bible doctrine,
the details of life compound their misery. There is no capacity for happiness
of love apart from Bible doctrine in the soul. Therefore, believers with scar
tissue are left with frustrated desires and insatiable lusts. Mental attitude
sins continue to result in self-induced misery. Scar tissue is only removed by confession
of known sins to God the Father followed by consistent intake and application
of Bible doctrine and the buildup of the edification complex of the soul.
Therefore, to remove scar tissue means a crash program of intake of Bible
doctrine under the enabling power of the Holy Spirit. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>David Teaching His Son Solomon about Adultery</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>David was teaching his son Solomon with a warning about
the evils of an adulteress called “the foreigner” in Proverbs 7:1-5. </p>

<p class=Verses>“My son, keep my words And treasure my commandments within you.
Keep my commandments and live, And my teaching as the apple of your eye. Bind
them on your fingers; Write them on the tablet of your heart. Say to wisdom, “You
are my sister,” And call understanding your intimate friend; That they may keep
you from an adulteress, From the foreigner who flatters with her words.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs
7:1-5, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>She was a married woman out on the street as a
prostitute. Prov. 7:16-19.</p>

<p class=Verses>““I have spread my couch with coverings, With colored linens of
Egypt. “I have sprinkled my bed With myrrh, aloes and cinnamon. “Come, let us
drink our fill of love until morning; Let us delight ourselves with caresses. “For
my husband is not at home, He has gone on a long journey;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs
7:16-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>She used seductive and persuasive flattery to seduce and
makes the prospect of sex very attractive. However, the end result of following
her was destruction.  Prov. 7:21-27. See category on <a href="#_Adultery">Adultery</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“With her many persuasions she entices him; With her flattering
lips she seduces him. Suddenly he follows her As an ox goes to the slaughter,
Or as one in fetters to the discipline of a fool, Until an arrow pierces
through his liver; As a bird hastens to the snare, So he does not know that it
will cost him his life. Now therefore, my sons, listen to me, And pay attention
to the words of my mouth. Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways, Do not
stray into her paths. For many are the victims she has cast down, And numerous
are all her slain. Her house is the way to Sheol, Descending to the chambers of
death.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 7:21-27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Divine Solution For Marriage Failure</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Married couples with difficult problems to deal with
don’t need subjective and relative humanistic solutions that do not last. They
need divine solutions. The Word of God provides permanent objective divine
solutions to difficult marital problems. The married couple should focus on
consistent daily intake and application of Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Christian couples who fail to expose themselves to the
teaching of Bible doctrine cannot resolve their marital problems. The secret to
success in marriage is reaching maturity in the spiritual life and the renewed
thinking that the filling of the Holy Spirit brings. Rom. 12:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by
the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that
which is good and acceptable and perfect.” (Romans 12:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The husband and the wife must each take responsibility
for their own sins. One of the most important factors in marriage is use of 1
John 1:9. The more time logged in spirituality, the better off the marriage
will be. Deut. 24:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Fathers shall not be put to death for their sons, nor
shall sons be put to death for their fathers; everyone shall be put to death
for his own sin.” (Deuteronomy 24:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The filling of the Holy Spirit and knowledge of Bible
doctrine are essential for a good marriage. The grace apparatus for perception must
function daily. One of the expressions of the filling of the Holy Spirit is the
expression of love and companionship in the daily walk. The stability which is
derived from the application of doctrine in the filling of the Holy Spirit in
the marriage relationship, is the basis for a tremendous witness for the Lord
Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Wherever domestic tranquility exists, the unbeliever is
quick to notice and it is often the springboard for the declaration of the
Gospel. Conversely the declaration of the Gospel is neutralized by failure in
this realm. Marital strife hinders prayer, which is one of the greatest
responsibilities in the life of a believer. 1 Peter 3:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“You husbands in the same way, live with your wives in an
understanding way, as with someone weaker, since she is a woman; and show her
honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life, so that your prayers will not be
hindered.” (1 Peter 3:7, NASB)</p>
