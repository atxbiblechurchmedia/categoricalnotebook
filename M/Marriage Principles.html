<h2><a name="_D-Marriage_Principles"></a><a name="_Marriage_Principles"></a>Marriage
Principles</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Many people have the idea that marriage is outdated and
that things have changed such that marriage is no longer necessary today. Many
think that marriage was for people and situations in the past. They are wrong.
There is nothing wrong with marriage. It’s not the fault of the divine
institution of marriage when marriages fail, it’s the fault of the people
involved. Marriage comes from God and is perfect. God is perfect and His plan
is perfect. Therefore, because marriage is part of His plan for mankind, then
marriage is perfect. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Divine Institution of Marriage </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Marriage as a divine institution has existed since the
very first marriage of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Marriage is the
basis for order in the human race. Without marriage there is a breakdown of the
human race and a breakdown of law and order.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>Marriage is designed by God as
a divine institution for both believers and unbelievers. </span>Marriage is also
the boundary for sex. All sex is to be inside the boundary of marriage.
Marriage is also the most stable environment for the rearing of children. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Since Christian marriage is a divine institution, two
believers are to marry or two unbelievers are to marry. Never a mix of the two.
Unbelievers or those who have not personally received Christ as Savior marry
and keep the freedoms within the laws of divine establishment as their focus
can have a happy and fulfilling marriage. However, that marriage cannot ever be
what a marriage of two believers can be.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Christian marriage serves to illustrate the
relationship of Christ and the Church, initiation and response, grace and
faith. See category on <a href="#_D-Marriage,_The_Divine_1">Marriage, The
Divine Institution</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Right Kind of Man for the Right Kind of Woman</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pattern of marriage where God brings the right kind
of woman to the man was established in Genesis 2:21-25. God built the woman for
the man. Woman was built to complete the man. Man recognized the woman as
fulfilling his deficiency. It is recognized that the relationship between the
husband and wife is to take the preeminence over former relationships. Man and
woman were brought together, the woman to the man and sex was instituted
immediately. Sex was instituted before the Fall and the basic function of sex
was recreation. </p>

<p class=Verses>“So the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and
he slept; then He took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh at that place.
The LORD God fashioned into a woman the rib which He had taken from the man,
and brought her to the man. The man said, &quot;This is now bone of my bones,
And flesh of my flesh; She shall be called Woman, Because she was taken out of
Man.&quot; For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother, and be
joined to his wife; and they shall become one flesh. And the man and his wife
were both naked and were not ashamed.” (Genesis 2:21-25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Malachi 2:15 states that a man is not to deal faithlessly
or deceitfully with his wife. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But not one has done so who has a remnant of the Spirit.
And what did that one do while he was seeking a godly offspring? Take heed then
to your spirit, and let no one deal treacherously against the wife of your
youth.” (Malachi 2:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The biblical analogies of the husband - wife relationships
in marriage are; one Savior - one Body of Christ made up of all Church Age
believers, one bridegroom, Jesus Christ - one bride (the Church). So there is
one man and one woman in God’s design for marriage. Eph. 5:31-33.</p>

<p class=Verses>“FOR THIS REASON A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AND
SHALL BE JOINED TO HIS WIFE, AND THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH. This mystery
is great; but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church.
Nevertheless, each individual among you also is to love his own wife even as
himself, and the wife must see to it that she respects her husband.” (Ephesians
5:31-33, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>No one can find total soul or sex love apart from the
husband-wife relationship in marriage.  Ezekiel 16 is the example of trying.
The right kind of man for the right kind of woman in marriage have bodies
designed for each other. God has designed the right combination to work
beautifully. Any port in a storm is out. All “cats” are grey at night is out.
All of these behaviors are disasters. Jer. 31:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;How long will you go here and there, O faithless
daughter? For the LORD has created a new thing in the earth— A woman will
encompass a man.&quot;” (Jeremiah 31:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Jeremiah 31:22, “A woman” refers to the right kind of
woman for the man. “Will encompass” means the woman in marriage will fit the
right kind of man in marriage. This is such a marvelous relationship. This is
matching of physical bodies.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sexual relations before marriage can destroy the
happiness in marriage. Sexual relations before marriage can destroy the soul
and make it impossible to discern the right kind of man or right kind of woman
when you find them. The woman, as a responder, is designed to respond to only her
husband. This is why immoral women whether ignorant or clever never understand
why they are not happy. Gen. 3:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;To the woman He said, &quot;I will greatly multiply Your
pain in childbirth, In pain you will bring forth children; Yet your desire will
be for your husband, And he will rule over you.&quot;&quot;  (Genesis 3:16,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Desire” in Genesis 3:16 is speaking of the woman’s
craving for a man, but it has to be the right kind of man for her. “And he will
rule” means one man. A woman must respect a man and must realize she is
surrendering her soul and body to that one man in marriage, surrendering her
freedom to him.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The woman can destroy her soul by seeking to respond to
the wrong kind of man and vice versa. Premarital sexual relations not only give
the woman and the man a horrible sense of guilt complex, but also the feeling
that, “I’ve blown it,” “I’m unclean, I’ll never be pure again.” For the
Christian man or woman, there is a recovery process, but it is summed up in one
phrase, “crash program.” A consistent daily intake of Bible doctrine.
Premarital sex also has an effect on the physical body. Prov. 6:32; Rom. 1:18;
Eph. 4:19; 1 Cor. 6:16-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The one who commits adultery with a woman is lacking
sense; He who would destroy himself does it.&quot;  (Proverbs 6:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all
ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in
unrighteousness,&quot;  (Romans 1:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and they, having become callous, have given themselves
over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with
greediness.&quot;  (Ephesians 4:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Or what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For
we are the temple of the living God; just as God said, &quot;I WILL DWELL IN
THEM AND WALK AMONG THEM; AND I WILL BE THEIR GOD, AND THEY SHALL BE MY PEOPLE.
&quot;Therefore, COME OUT FROM THEIR MIDST AND BE SEPARATE,&quot; says the
Lord. &quot;AND DO NOT TOUCH WHAT IS UNCLEAN; And I will welcome you. &quot;And
I will be a father to you, And you shall be sons and daughters to Me,&quot;
Says the Lord Almighty.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 6:16-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Monogamy is the only way to go. Monogamy or one man, one
woman (in contrast to polygamy, one man, many women) was ordained by God for
marriage in the first marriage in the Garden. 1 Cor. 7:2-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But because of immoralities, each man is to have his own
wife, and each woman is to have her own husband. The husband must fulfill his
duty to his wife, and likewise also the wife to her husband. The wife does not
have authority over her own body, but the husband does; and likewise also the
husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does. &quot; 
(1 Corinthians 7:2-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers are always to marry believers. 2 Cor. 6:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Do not be bound together with unbelievers; for what
partnership have righteousness and lawlessness, or what fellowship has light
with darkness?&quot;  (2 Corinthians 6:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Even unbelievers who are married to those that adhere to
the rule of law, the divine institutions, and the laws of divine establishment can
have great happiness with each other. Also, in the life of a believer with scar
tissue on their soul, when they marry the right kind of spouse, they can derive
great happiness from their marriage. Eccl. 9:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Enjoy life with the woman whom you love all the days of
your fleeting life which He has given to you under the sun; for this is your
reward in life and in your toil in which you have labored under the sun.&quot; 
(Ecclesiastes 9:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Why is this point so important? If the unbeliever with
the right unbelieving woman can be happy, just think of the happiness that you
can enjoy as a believer when both have a complete edification complex of the
soul. The edification complex of the soul based on <i>epignosis</i> Bible
doctrine enables grace-orientation, a relaxed mental attitude, inner happiness,
capacity to love, and the mastery of the details of life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The woman is the glory of the man. She reflects his
stability, his love, his strength, his protection, his edification complex of
the soul. She responds to him and enjoys him immensely. He is her life and thus
reflects the glory of God as well. 1 Cor. 11:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For a man ought not to have his head covered, since he is
the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man.&quot;  (1
Corinthians 11:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The identification of the right kind of man or right kind
of woman is vitally important. 1 Cor. 7:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But if they do not have self-control, let them marry; for
it is better to marry than to burn with passion. &quot;  (1 Corinthians 7:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Marriage Affects Spiritual Growth </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual growth will be affected by marriage. Often
times, it will slow it down. This may because of multiple interests in either
the husband or wife. Problems and conflicts can arise when each spouse has a
different level of spiritual maturity when they marry.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In marriage, often the mathematical maxim is true, the
whole is greater than the sum of the parts. The problems, tests, blessings,
responsibilities when put together in marriage are greater than the sum of
those same things treated separately by each individual. Marriage may hinder
individual prayer and prayer as a couple. In marriage, each spouse might not
have the same level of <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the right lobe of their
soul, but you will have two old sin natures working together. 1 Peter 3.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ephesians 5:1 commands us to be a genuine imitator of God.
Ephesians 5:2 commands us to walk in the sphere of love in the Christian way of
life with emphasis is on love from the spiritual life. The most important
virtue in life is knowledge of Bible doctrine. With knowledge of doctrine you
can make right decisions and be more discerning. <i>Epignosis</i> Bible
doctrine in your soul is your basis and stability for having unconditional love
for others. Your happiness is based on your spiritual life. Gratitude and
thanksgiving comes from knowing that God has blessed you and that you are
totally dependent on Him and His grace resources to fulfill His plan for your
life. With respect to work, with virtue, honor and integrity you can do your
job as unto the Lord.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children; and walk
in love, just as Christ also loved you and gave Himself up for us, an offering
and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma.” (Ephesians 5:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ephesians 5:14-18 refers to the believer redeeming their
time on this earth through the filling of the Spirit. With the filling of the
Spirit, you function on God's timing, not yours. Happiness is from spiritual
growth, not from being married. Therefore, your marriage can only reach a
mutual inner happiness from spiritual growth and developing the capacity for
life, for love and ultimately thinking more like that of Jesus Christ. 1 Cor
2:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason it says, &quot;Awake, sleeper, And arise from
the dead, And Christ will shine on you.&quot; Therefore be careful how you
walk, not as unwise men but as wise, making the most of your time, because the
days are evil. So then do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the
Lord is. And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but be filled
with the Spirit,” (Ephesians 5:14-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT
HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.” (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our age is not more evil than others because Ephesians
5:14-18 says “the days are evil” which means the days always keep on being
evil. We are commanded to keep on being filled with the Holy Spirit. The right
kind of man and the right kind of woman are the man and woman who have virtue
from spiritual growth. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Identification of the Right One for You </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The identification of the right kind of man or right kind
of woman can result from a spiritually mature person with an edification
complex of the soul having “blips” on the radar screen or an adolescent
believer taking it on a faith basis that he has found the right kind of woman
or she has found the right kind of man. Therefore, it should never be a frantic
search. 1 Cor. 7:17; 1 Cor. 7:27.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Only, as the Lord has assigned to each one, as God has
called each, in this manner let him walk. And so I direct in all the
churches.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 7:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be released. Are
you released from a wife? Do not seek a wife.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 7:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The identification of the right kind of man or right kind
of woman can result from the spiritually immature believer or unbeliever on a
soul basis or compatibility of mentalities, volitions, conscience, self-consciousness
and emotions, or their oppositeness unifies. Prov. 31:11; Prov. 31:16; Prov.
31:25; Prov. 31:28.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The heart of her husband trusts in her, And he will have
no lack of gain.&quot;  (Proverbs 31:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;She considers a field and buys it; From her earnings she
plants a vineyard.&quot;  (Proverbs 31:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Strength and dignity are her clothing, And she smiles at
the future.&quot;  (Proverbs 31:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Her children rise up and bless her; Her husband also, and
he praises her, saying: &quot;  (Proverbs 31:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The identification of the right kind of man or right kind
of woman can result on a physical basis such as physical attraction for the
member of the opposite sex, desire for sex with that person, and exercising the
safeguards of the other person’s soul and body. When you get your right kind of
man or right kind of woman, you have received grace from the Lord. The right kind
of man or woman is always from the Lord.  Prov. 18:22; Prov. 19:13-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He who finds a wife finds a good thing And obtains favor
from the LORD.&quot;  (Proverbs 18:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;A foolish son is destruction to his father, And the
contentions of a wife are a constant dripping. House and wealth are an
inheritance from fathers, But a prudent wife is from the LORD.&quot;  (Proverbs
19:13-14, NASB)</p>
