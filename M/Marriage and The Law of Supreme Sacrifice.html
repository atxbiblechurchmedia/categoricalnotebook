<h2><a name="_D-Marriage_and_The"></a>Marriage and The Law of Supreme Sacrifice</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The greatest decision in life is receiving Jesus Christ
as your Savior. Another great decision is whether or not to marry. Marriage is
a good and wonderful thing as long as you have the right person, the one the
Lord has for you. However, the Lord has certain responsibilities for some men
and women whereby, if they enter into marriage (even though it may be good in
principle) it can be wrong for them because it cuts into their time of service
in the plan of God. An example is the Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 9:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do we not have a right to take along a believing wife, even as
the rest of the apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas?” (1
Corinthians 9:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There was a tremendous need for concentrated service for
the Lord. The real issue is utilization of time and quite obviously the single
believer has more time to serve the Lord. The principle in 1 Corinthians 7:38
is that it is better for the utilization of time when one is serving the Lord
to be single rather than married.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So then both he who gives his own virgin daughter in marriage
does well, and he who does not give her in marriage will do better.” (1
Corinthians 7:38, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In married status, time is consumed in making the married
successful. Your spouse must not be neglected! Marriage time is consumed in
training children. Children must not be neglected! Marriage time is consumed in
providing physical needs of the family. Business must not be neglected.
Marriage time is consumed in doing certain things in the Lord’s service. The
Lord must not be neglected!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Bible commands responsibility in these areas. All
believers are in full time Christian service. Both single and married status
are right. Each case must be discerned on its own personal merits. Each person
must decide for themselves which is better for them. There are some people who
will not use time properly unless they are married.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Celibacy is not holier than marriage. Under certain
conditions, it can be a satanic doctrine. Spirituality is the filling of the
Holy Spirit in either single or married status. 1 Tim. 4:1-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will
fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and doctrines
of demons, by means of the hypocrisy of liars seared in their own conscience as
with a branding iron, men who forbid marriage and advocate abstaining from
foods which God has created to be gratefully shared in by those who believe and
know the truth.” (1 Timothy 4:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are times when we have to choose between using our
time for a legitimate activity or using our time for the Lord’s service. 1 Cor.
7:30.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and those who weep, as though they did not weep; and those who
rejoice, as though they did not rejoice; and those who buy, as though they did
not possess;” (1 Corinthians 7:30, NASB)</p>
