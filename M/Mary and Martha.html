<h2>Mary and Martha</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mary and Martha were the sisters of Lazarus and all lived
in Bethany. In Luke 10:38, “as they were traveling” is the present active
infinitive of <span lang=EL>πορευ</span>́<span lang=EL>ομαι</span> (poreuomai)
and means to go from one place to another - the reality of it. “Welcomed” is
the aorist middle indicative of <span lang=EL>υ</span>̔<span lang=EL>ποδε</span>́<span
lang=EL>χομαι</span> (hupodechomai) and means to welcome with open arms because
of authority or to entertain a guest who carries authority. Martha was the
older sister. Martha in receiving the Lord gladly indicated that she was in
fellowship with the Lord.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now as they were traveling along, He entered a village; and a
woman named Martha welcomed Him into her home.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Luke 10:38, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 10:40, “Mary, who was seated” is the aorist
passive participle of <span lang=EL>παρακαθε</span>́<span lang=EL>ζομαι</span>
(parakathezomai) and means to sit down beside. It has nothing to do with the
feet. Martha was out in the kitchen fixing something. Mary sat down beside our
Lord and was listening to Him teach. “Listening” is the imperfect active
indicative of <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>κου</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(akouō) and means she kept on listening to Him. She accepted His authority and
was concentrating on what He was saying.</p>

<p class=Verses>“She had a sister called Mary, who was seated at the Lord’s
feet, listening to His word.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Luke 10:39, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 10:40, “distracted” is the imperfect passive
indicative of <span lang=EL>περισπα</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (perispaō)
and means to have your face drawn through pressure, to be distracted,
overburdened, to be weighed down and to show it.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But Martha was distracted with all her preparations; and she
came up to Him and said, “Lord, do You not care that my sister has left me to
do all the serving alone? Then tell her to help me.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Luke 10:40,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mary was sitting down and constantly listening to our
Lord teaching whereas Martha was getting overwhelmed with all the work she had
to get done by herself. It kept hitting her that she was the only one working
to get all of the food ready for so many guests. Both Martha and Mary were
doing what they wanted to do. Martha was a hustler and Mary was a listener. But
one was upset and the other was not. People can be very different. Here, Martha
was a hard worker while Mary was content to sit around and study doctrine. Both
were believers, but there is a principle here of live and let live.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer who listens to Bible doctrine will always be
picked at, downgraded, or bad-mouthed by someone who feels they should be busy
doing something productive like cleaning the house or preparing food for
guests. For people who hustle and are hard workers, this can be an occupational
hazard. They always get overburdened and then get critical. Then there are the
ones who want to get Bible doctrine and are inclined to not do anything else.
Both sisters are entirely different. Martha had an inclination toward legalism.
Mary had an inclination toward grace.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Martha burst in on our Lord while He was teaching and
interrupted Him. She just finally blew up. The hustling types always want those
who are not doing anything to get busy working on something. There is a place
for hustlers, but their occupational hazard is that they just can’t stand
people who aren’t doing any physical activity. They are critical of them. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the light of eternity, what was more important here?
There is not a single line in this verse about what food was served. But we
have several lines on what was being taught and who was benefiting.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It takes a lot of spiritual maturity to hustle around a
kitchen alone when everybody else is sitting in the living room listening to
Bible doctrine being taught. It takes a lot of spiritual maturity to stay in
fellowship and not get overwhelmed. Remember that if you who are inclined to
listen to doctrine all your life, someone is going to be inclined to make an
issue of it. You just have to stick with it and listen. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 10:40, “do You not care” is <span lang=EL>με</span>́<span
lang=EL>λω</span> (melō) and is an impersonal word and means, “Lord, what
about me, don’t you care? I’m not getting any help out there.”  “That my sister
has left me” is the imperfect active indicative of <span lang=EL>καταλει</span>́<span
lang=EL>πω</span> (kataleipō) meaning that Mary had left her work in the
kitchen just to get Bible doctrine from our Lord!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A woman or man out or fellowship can be rude. Martha was
being rude and couldn’t imagine anything more important that preparing food for
guests. People who are hard workers can often feel alone and inclined to feel
sorry for themselves when they are getting no help. They must do their work in
fellowship and as unto the lord! Everybody should have a job at some time or
another. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 10:40, “tell her” is the aorist active imperative
of <span lang=EL>λε</span>́<span lang=EL>γω</span> (legō) and means to tell her
right now. “Help me” is  the aorist middle subjunctive of <span lang=EL>συναντιλαμβα</span>́<span
lang=EL>νομαι</span> (sunantilambanomai) and means to seize, to take hold
(strong) and help. She is just about to shake her sister and drag her into the
kitchen.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 10:41, “you are worried” is the present active
indicative of <span lang=EL>μεριμνα</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (merimnaō)
and means to be divided in mind and therefore worried. “Bothered” is <span
lang=EL>θορυβα</span>́<span lang=EL>ζω</span> (thorubazō) and means to be
disturbed because of pressure you have built up within yourself.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the Lord answered and said to her, “Martha, Martha, you
are worried and bothered about so many things;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Luke 10:41, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The details of life for a hard worker will be a rough
test to pass without many failures. You must stay in fellowship. People are
just not wired the same. Whether a hustler or passive type of woman, you are to
live your life as unto the Lord. Here, Jesus chastises Martha for her mental
attitude sins.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 10:42, “necessary” is the present active
indicative of <span lang=EL>χρει</span>́<span lang=EL>α</span> (chreia) and
means the one thing keeps on being absolutely necessary. What is that? Bible
doctrine being taught! It is more important that eating as in Job 23:12. It
will always be important. There never will be a time when it is not important.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but only one thing is necessary, for Mary has chosen the good
part, which shall not be taken away from her.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Luke 10:42, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Mary has chosen” is the aorist middle indicative of <span
lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>κλε</span>́<span lang=EL>γομαι</span>
(eklegomai) and means she chosen and benefitted from her choice. “The good part”
is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>γαθο</span>́<span lang=EL>ς</span><span
lang=EL> </span><span lang=EL>μερι</span>́<span lang=EL>ς</span> (agathos
meris) and means that Mary has selected the best dish being served. What is
that? Bible doctrine, of course. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Which shall not be taken away from her” is the future
passive indicative of <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>φαιρε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (aphaireō) and means will never be cut off from her. The
grace lady in fellowship and positive to Bible doctrine has selected the best
possible dish of food. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This verse really shows how our Lord handled problems
with a subtle sense of humor. Instead of being upset with a friend who had just
rudely interrupted His Bible doctrine lesson and was demanding that He force
Mary to return to the kitchen to do her work, He calmed Martha down and
patiently pointed out to her that Mary had selected the best food which was the
teaching of Bible doctrine. He taught her that this spiritual food was far more
important than the physical food being served. This food stays with you
forever.</p>
