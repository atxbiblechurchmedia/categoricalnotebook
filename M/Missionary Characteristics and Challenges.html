<h2>Missionary Characteristics and Challenges</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every missionary must be a believer and should also
understand how he was saved. Gal. 3:26; Eph. 2:8-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.” 
(Galatians 3:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not
of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one
may boast.”  (Ephesians 2:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He must know Bible doctrine by study. Doctrine is the
basis for true motivation in missions. He must understand that all believers
are in full time Christian service and that God has led him in that way. He
must have enough doctrine (a developed edification complex) to apply Bible
doctrine from his frame of reference in unusual circumstances. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He must be oriented to the plan of God from salvation, orientation
to the grace apparatus for perception, and how spiritual maturity is achieved.
He must be guided by the Word and God’s will for all unbelievers to become
believers. He must understand the principle of divine guidance where God guides
the missionary to geographical areas where there is positive volition. 2 Peter
3:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some count
slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing for any to perish but for all
to come to repentance.” (2 Peter 3:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They must be separated from the details of life to study
the Word. There is also a need for separation from emotional believers and
cult-apostacy movements. A missionary who claims to be evangelistic
(evangelical) and is in the tongues movement is in apostacy and blasphemy. 2
Cor. 6:11-12; Rom. 16:17-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Our mouth has spoken freely to you, O Corinthians, our heart
is opened wide. You are not restrained by us, but you are restrained in your
own affections.”  (2 Corinthians 6:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now I urge you, brethren, keep your eye on those who cause
dissensions and hindrances contrary to the teaching which you learned, and turn
away from them. For such men are slaves, not of our Lord Christ but of their
own appetites; and by their smooth and flattering speech they deceive the
hearts of the unsuspecting.”  (Romans 16:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He must be acclimated to his field. He must be adjusted
to all circumstances such as weather, customs, language, etc. Must train his
converts to go out and witness to their own people on the indigenous witnessing
principle.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Holy Spirit is responsible for appointing spiritual
gifts. The Holy Spirit is responsible for the placement of personnel in the
mission field. No matter how sensational, personable, how much human ability
man may have, if a person is not appointed by the Holy Spirit for the mission
field, and he goes into this field, he is in the wrong slot. Missionaries are
chosen by the Holy Spirit, not the local church. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Missionaries must be taken from the leadership spiritual
gifts of evangelism and pastor-teacher and they must qualify on the basis of
maximum amount of Bible doctrine known. There must be a stable local church for
effective missionary work. He must have the prayer support as well as the
financial support of the local church to function properly in the mission
field.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Missionary Must Be Spiritually Mature </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Missionaries must be born-again and understand the plan
of God. The missionary must exercise his spiritual gift of evangelism and any
other gift he has been given by the Holy Spirit. The spiritual gift of
Evangelism is a divine ability given at the moment of salvation and developed
through preparation. He must be spiritually mature. That is, he must be
familiar with the whole counsel of God’s Word. He gets mature by study! 2 Tim.
2:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman
who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth.” (2
Timothy 2:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Timothy 2:15, “Be diligent” is aorist active
imperative of <span lang=EL>σπουδα</span>́<span lang=EL>ζω</span> (spoudazō) and
means to be industrious, eager, to be diligent, to make every effort, to exert
oneself to the point of sweating. This is a command. It actually is a way of
life which includes the proper mental attitude and motivation to learn Bible
doctrine daily. It is positive volition to Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“To present yourself” means to make every effort to
represent yourself and concentrate on being objective to Bible doctrine. They
must give complete priority to the Word of God. The whole reason for a
missionary going to the mission field is to live Bible doctrine and bring the Gospel
of Jesus Christ to people! By doing so, they live the life of Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Approved” is <span lang=EL>δο</span>́<span lang=EL>κιμος</span>
(dokimos) and means to pass an exam with emphasis on succeeding, not failing.
You must study to be a successful missionary. You must apply what you study.
This is the real test for all believers, not just missionaries. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Your study should include testing the accuracy of what you
teach every day. As you study, you are tested, did you study today? As you
apply Bible doctrine are you using a grace viewpoint or legalism? Are you
depending upon man or God? Can you iron a shirt or prepare a meal to His glory?</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Workman” is <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>ργα</span>́<span
lang=EL>της</span> (ergatēs) and means an agricultural worker, a laborer, a
routine worker. This work speaks of the one who is involved in the mundane,
routine, humdrum, distasteful, ordinary, and dull things of life. In the
ancient world, it meant to feed the cattle, milk the cows, clean out the barn,
hoe weeds, prepare ground, etc. The emphasis here is on doing small, routine
things as unto the Lord.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Everyone today wants to do great things for God and then
get written up in some Christian magazine. You may think that leading the chief
of a tribe to Christ is more spiritual than giving a cup of cold water in the
Lord’s name. No! The Christian life is fantastic where any task however small
or mundane can be done as unto the Lord. You must be in fellowship, taking in
the Word daily and staying out of emotional revolt.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Timothy 2:15, “who does not need to be ashamed” is a
triple adjective and means a workman that is not ashamed. You don’t have to be
ashamed of your station in life if it’s an honest vocation. Whether you are a
pea picker, tulip farmer, or a purple thumbed carpenter you are in full time
Christian service. A missionary must not despise the small things of daily
living. He must keep on being grace oriented.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Accurately handling” means to cut straight, to cut a
straight path. No deviation into the cults, no deviation into the tongues
movement, keep with accurate interpretation and application of the Word of God.
Literally, to stay with the Word of truth. This is the enabling of a life with
no detours, hang-ups, or blind alleys to divide it with the Word of God, Bible
doctrine. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The corrected translation is, “Making every effort to
represent yourself approved to God, an irreproachable worker cutting a straight
path with the Word of truth.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Negative Volition Test</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The missionary must be able to stand the test of negative
volition on the part of those to whom he ministers. Acts 13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“While they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy
Spirit said, &quot;Set apart for Me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I
have called them.&quot;” (Acts 13:2, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to
Seleucia and from there they sailed to Cyprus.” (Acts 13:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Nothing tests the missionary more than nonresponse on the
part of those to whom he ministers. Paul began his first missionary journey
roughly 10 years after he was saved. At this time, he was spiritually mature.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Negative Volition of a False Teacher (Unbeliever)</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Like the witchdoctor in a tribe, the false teacher seeks
to keep others from believing. Correct the situation by using the direct
approach. Acts 13:6-13; Acts 13:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos,
they found a magician, a Jewish false prophet whose name was Bar-Jesus,” (Acts
13:6, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“But Elymas the magician (for so his name is translated) was
opposing them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith.” (Acts 13:8,
NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“and said, &quot;You who are full of all deceit and fraud, you
son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to make
crooked the straight ways of the Lord?” (Acts 13:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Negative Volition of Religion</u> </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Religion is different than Christianity. Religion opposes
grace and opposes the correct teaching of the Word of God. Religion’s negative
volition includes being filled with envy as they were jealous of Paul because
of the positive response of the people. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Religion’s negative volition also includes mental
attitude sins that fabricate lies and run down doctrinal believers who attend
churches that adhere to the Word of God from the original languages. These are
the most vicious. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 13:45, “began contradicting the things spoken by
Paul” means they spoke against Bible doctrine and didn’t like it being taught
verse by verse. They didn’t like Christ being called the Messiah. They didn’t
like Paul’s authoritative teaching. They were the religious bosses and
controlled everything religiously in a given town. In contrast, there were many
who were following Paul’s teaching. Acts 13:43</p>

<p class=Verses>“But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with
jealousy and began contradicting the things spoken by Paul, and were
blaspheming.” (Acts 13:45, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now when the meeting of the synagogue had broken up, many of
the Jews and of the God-fearing proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who,
speaking to them, were urging them to continue in the grace of God.” (Acts
13:43, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 13:46, Paul and Barnabas “spoke out boldly” means
to speak dogmatically with authority and confidence. It was necessary that the
Word of God should first have been spoken to the Jews. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly and said, &quot;It was
necessary that the word of God be spoken to you first; since you repudiate it
and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we are turning to the
Gentiles.” (Acts 13:46, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Since you repudiate it” refers to the negative violation
of the Jewish religious unbeliever who judged themselves “unworthy of eternal
life.” Paul and Barnabas left them and went elsewhere to places of positive
volition and had great results. Acts 13:48-49.</p>

<p class=Verses>“When the Gentiles heard this, they began rejoicing and
glorifying the word of the Lord; and as many as had been appointed to eternal
life believed. And the word of the Lord was being spread through the whole
region.” (Acts 13:48-49, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Negative Volition of Believers </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The negative believers were not negative to the salvation
message, but they were negative to categorical Bible doctrine. They believed
that circumcision as a religious work was needed for salvation. Acts 15:1-2;
Acts 15:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Some men came down from Judea and began teaching the brethren,
&quot;Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot
be saved.&quot; And when Paul and Barnabas had great dissension and debate with
them, the brethren determined that Paul and Barnabas and some others of them
should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders concerning this issue.”
(Acts 15:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But some of the sect of the Pharisees who had believed stood
up, saying, &quot;It is necessary to circumcise them and to direct them to
observe the Law of Moses.&quot;” (Acts 15:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Negative volition in the believer is caused by dragging human
works into God’s plan of grace by doing something for God. Well, aren’t you
supposed to do good works? We are to stay in fellowship and let the Holy Spirit
work through us to produce divine good instead of human good.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The solution is a strong stand for the grace of God.
Never give in to the legalists. Missionaries must understand the doctrine of
volition, both from its positive and negative standpoints! Acts 15:7-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“After there had been much debate, Peter stood up and said to
them, &quot;Brethren, you know that in the early days God made a choice among
you, that by my mouth the Gentiles would hear the word of the gospel and
believe. &quot;And God, who knows the heart, testified to them giving them the
Holy Spirit, just as He also did to us; and He made no distinction between us
and them, cleansing their hearts by faith. &quot;Now therefore why do you put
God to the test by placing upon the neck of the disciples a yoke which neither our
fathers nor we have been able to bear? &quot;But we believe that we are saved
through the grace of the Lord Jesus, in the same way as they also are.&quot;”
(Acts 15:7-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Spiritual Endurance</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul is an illustration of spiritual endurance in 2
Timothy 4:7-8 and in Hebrews 11:32-40.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I
have kept the faith; in the future there is laid up for me the crown of
righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that
day; and not only to me, but also to all who have loved His appearing.”  (2
Timothy 4:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And what more shall I say? For time will fail me if I tell of
Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets, who by
faith conquered kingdoms, performed acts of righteousness, obtained promises,
shut the mouths of lions, quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the
sword, from weakness were made strong, became mighty in war, put foreign armies
to flight.” (Hebrews 11:32-34, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“And all these, having gained approval through their faith, did
not receive what was promised, because God had provided something better for
us, so that apart from us they would not be made perfect.” (Hebrews 11:39-40,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Enemy of Spiritual Endurance </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The enemy of spiritual endurance is brittleness of the
soul. Hardship is a vocabulary term for spiritual endurance or having iron in
the soul. The enemy of spiritual endurance is brittleness of the soul. 2 Tim.
2:3; Prov. 27:17; Jer. 13:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Suffer hardship with me, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.” 
(2 Timothy 2:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Iron sharpens iron, So one man sharpens another.”  (Proverbs
27:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““I will dash them against each other, both the fathers and the
sons together,” declares the LORD. “I will not show pity nor be sorry nor have
compassion so as not to destroy them.”‘““  (Jeremiah 13:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the ancient world, they understood the concept of the
shattering of a dried out wineskin. In Jeremiah 13:14, “I will dash” is the
piel imperfect of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>נָפַץ</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (naphats) and is very strong. God
indicates destruction of soul at the end of the verse “to destroy them.” This
is talking about the disintegration of the soul, the shattering of the soul,
the destruction of the soul of an individual as in Proverbs 6:32.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I will dash them against each other, both the fathers
and the sons together,&quot; declares the LORD. &quot;I will not show pity nor
be sorry nor have compassion so as not to destroy them.&quot;'&quot;” (Jeremiah
13:14, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“The one who commits adultery with a woman is lacking sense; He
who would destroy himself does it.”  (Proverbs 6:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the context of Jeremiah 13, the soul becomes brittle when
the believer fails to respond to doctrine and either goes into idolatry where
religion is substituted for Christianity or into sexual sins. There is a
fundamental type of religion, a conservative religion, and a liberal religion.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When the believer goes liberal toward Bible doctrine, they
are often prospered by the devil, although they attribute it to the blessing of
God. As such, they conduct a frantic search for happiness. For example,
Solomon, even though out of fellowship was prospered materially, yet in his
frantic search he found nothing to satisfy him. The Book of Ecclesiastes covers
this.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In this context, when you drink the from jug of this
life, not only does the jug shatter in your face, but so does your soul. This
is called the sin unto death. 1 John 5:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If anyone sees his brother committing a sin not leading to
death, he shall ask and God will for him give life to those who commit sin not
leading to death. There is a sin leading to death; I do not say that he should
make request for this.”  (1 John 5:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Brittleness of soul can become a way of life for the
believer. When enough believers in a nation are in this shape, the country goes
into terrible divine judgment as did Judah in Jeremiah 13:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The cities of the Negev have been locked up, And there is no
one to open them; All Judah has been carried into exile, Wholly carried into
exile.”  (Jeremiah 13:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is the pursuit of happiness apart from divine
provision and divine design! Brittleness of soul is the antithesis of the
edification complex of the soul. A brittle soul is an unfulfilled soul. It must
be fulfilled by the Lord and His Word. Instead of grace orientation, the
brittle soul of a believer has legalism, human viewpoint, self-righteousness,
self-justification, pride, is critical of everyone, is an irritable character, has
a super sensitivity, and accepts no authority but themselves. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Instead of the mastery of the details of life, the
details master them. This leads to cheap substitutes! Instead of a relaxed
mental attitude, a brittle soul has mental attitude sins of bitterness,
jealousy, hatred, and cruelty. Instead of capacity to love, a brittle soul has
pseudo love, a sticky-sweet love, boredom and instability. Instead of perfect
happiness, the brittle soul has depression, frustration, and instant
stimulation followed by constant misery.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Mechanics of Spiritual Endurance </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At salvation, the soul is saved, but has no stability
yet. The daily intake of doctrine stabilizes the soul and gives endurance of
soul and takes the brittleness out of the system. This is the edification
complex of the soul. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Men who have the communication gifts of evangelist and
pastor-teacher have three purposes in teaching the Word. In Ephesians 4:11-12,
“equipping of the saints” is <span lang=EL>καταρτισμο</span>́<span lang=EL>ς</span>
(katartismos) in the Greek and means face to face teaching for the purpose of
perfecting or training and equipping for combat in the Angelic Conflict. “Work”
is <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓́<span lang=EL>ργον</span> (ergon) and means inner
unseen production of divine good from the right lobe of the soul. The Word of
God dominates the soul. This is in contrast to <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span
lang=EL>γαθο</span>́<span lang=EL>ς</span> (agathos) which is overt or visible
divine good. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some
as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the
saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ;” 
(Ephesians 4:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Service” is <span lang=EL>διακονι</span>́<span lang=EL>α</span>
(diakonia) means spiritual service and refers to the universal ministry of the
believer. The accumulation of <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the right lobe
of the soul plus the consistent filling of the Holy Spirit is the basis for the
production of divine good. “Building” is <span lang=EL>οι</span>̓<span lang=EL>κοδομη</span>́
(oikodomē) and means edifying or to build a structure, the edification complex
of the soul, to spiritual maturity. This is for all Church Age believers - the
entire Body of Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The corrected translation of Ephesians 4:12 becomes, “Face
to face (teaching) for the equipping and training of the saints for combat, for
the production of the ministry (inner and overt) for the edification of the Body
of Christ.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Three Objectives of the Ministry </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The three objectives of the ministry of the
pastor-teacher are unity of the faith, full knowledge of God (completion of the
edification complex of the soul), and spiritual maturity. These objectives are summarized
in Ephesians 4:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the
knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature
which belongs to the fullness of Christ.”  (Ephesians 4:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Until” means the objective is now summarized. Until all
believers attain. All believers must be under the authority of some local
church to grow spiritually. When you find organizations floating loose who are
not under local churches and where the pastor communicates doctrine, you are
looking at the flotsam and jetsam of the spiritual life. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Attain” is <span lang=EL>καταντα</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(katantaō) and means to reach a goal, to arrive at a destination, to arrive at
an objective. “To the unity of the faith” is not brotherhood unity. It refers
to the fact that everyone arrives in the same way. The pastor communicates
doctrine and the congregation takes in the Word under the grace apparatus for
perception and erects their edification complexes. That is unity. It refers to
the objective of the faith or Bible doctrine as a system of categorical <i>epignosis</i>
in the heart or right lobe of the soul. <i>Epignosis</i> is believed Bible
doctrine or full knowledge of the Word of God. This includes the application of
that Bible doctrine in personal rapport <i>phileo</i> love toward God and
unconditional mental attitude <i>agapao</i> love toward mankind.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ephesians 4:13, “to a mature man” is <span lang=EL>τε</span>́<span
lang=EL>λειος</span> (teleios) and means spiritual maturity, completion of the
edification complex. A Christian in spiritual maturity is a part of Christian
nobility. “Measure” is <span lang=EL>με</span>́<span lang=EL>τρον</span>
(metron) and means to the standard. “Stature” is <span lang=EL>η</span>̔<span
lang=EL>λικι</span>́<span lang=EL>α</span> (hēlikia) and means full age or
prime of life of the fullness of Christ and refers to His completed edification
complex, Christ’s spiritual maturity. “Fullness” is <span lang=EL>πλη</span>́<span
lang=EL>ρωμα</span> (plērōma) and is Jesus Christ having an edification
complex of the soul as the result of the function of the grace apparatus for
perception. Luke 2:40; Luke 2:52; John 1:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The Child continued to grow and become strong, increasing in
wisdom; and the grace of God was upon Him.”  (Luke 2:40, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And Jesus kept increasing in wisdom and stature, and in favor
with God and men.”  (Luke 2:52, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw His
glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.” 
(John 1:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The corrected translation of Ephesians 4:13 is, “Until we
all arrive at the objective (through the faithful teaching of the
pastor-teacher) with reference to the unity of the faith (system of doctrine)
and the <i>epignosis</i> (full knowledge) of the Son of God unto the mature
nobleman, unto the standard of the prime of life of the full development of
Christ.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The last characteristic a missionary must have is iron in
his soul, a soul of endurance, a soul free from any brittleness, a mature soul.</p>
