<h2><a name="_D-Mystery"></a>Mystery</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Three passages deal with the principle of the Greek word <span
lang=EL>μυστη</span>́<span lang=EL>ριον</span> (mustērion) or mystery and
actually define the word. Eph. 3:1-11; Col. 1:25-27; Rom. 16:25-26.</p>

<p class=Verses>“that by revelation there was made known to me the mystery, as
I wrote before in brief. By referring to this, when you read you can understand
my insight into the mystery of Christ, which in other generations was not made
known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and
prophets in the Spirit; to be specific, that the Gentiles are fellow heirs and
fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus
through the gospel, of which I was made a minister, according to the gift of
God's grace which was given to me according to the working of His power.”
(Ephesians 3:3-7, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“Of this church I was made a minister according to the
stewardship from God bestowed on me for your benefit, so that I might fully
carry out the preaching of the word of God, that is, the mystery which has been
hidden from the past ages and generations, but has now been manifested to His
saints, to whom God willed to make known what is the riches of the glory of
this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Colossians
1:25-27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now to Him who is able to establish you according to my gospel
and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery
which has been kept secret for long ages past, but now is manifested, and by
the Scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal
God, has been made known to all the nations, leading to obedience of faith;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
16:25-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The etymology indicates in the 5th century BC, a group of
fraternities existed which had a sacred doctrine. Those on the outside did not
know the doctrine. However, once inside and initiated into the organizations,
the mysteries became known. Thus, the word mystery.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Eight Mysteries in the New Testament </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Eight mysteries or doctrines are referred to in the New
Testament and are known only believers through the filling of the Holy Spirit
and the grace apparatus for perception. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Body of Christ. Eph. 3:1-11. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the
sake of you Gentiles— if indeed you have heard of the stewardship of God's
grace which was given to me for you; that by revelation there was made known to
me the mystery, as I wrote before in brief. By referring to this, when you read
you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ, which in other
generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed
to His holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit;” (Ephesians 3:1-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Bride of Christ. Eph. 5:28-32. </p>

<p class=Verses>“So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own
bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself; for no one ever hated his own
flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also does the church,
because we are members of His body. FOR THIS REASON A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS
FATHER AND MOTHER AND SHALL BE JOINED TO HIS WIFE, AND THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE
FLESH. This mystery is great; but I am speaking with reference to Christ and
the church.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 5:28-32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Church. Rev. 1:20 </p>

<p class=Verses>““As for the mystery of the seven stars which you saw in My
right hand, and the seven golden lampstands: the seven stars are the angels of
the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation
1:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The indwelling of Jesus Christ in every Church Age
believer. Col. 1:26-27. </p>

<p class=Verses>“that is, the mystery which has been hidden from the past ages
and generations, but has now been manifested to His saints, to whom God willed
to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the
Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Colossians
1:26-27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spirituality/Godliness. 1 Tim. 3:16. </p>

<p class=Verses>“By common confession, great is the mystery of godliness: He
who was revealed in the flesh, Was vindicated in the Spirit, Seen by angels,
Proclaimed among the nations, Believed on in the world, Taken up in glory.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Timothy 3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing> The Rapture (translation) of the Church. 1 Cor. 15:51-57.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Behold, I tell you a mystery; we will not all sleep, but we
will all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last
trumpet; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable,
and we will be changed. For this perishable must put on the imperishable, and
this mortal must put on immortality. But when this perishable will have put on
the imperishable, and this mortal will have put on immortality, then will come
about the saying that is written, “DEATH IS SWALLOWED UP in victory. “O DEATH,
WHERE IS YOUR VICTORY? O DEATH, WHERE IS YOUR STING?” The sting of death is
sin, and the power of sin is the law; but thanks be to God, who gives us the
victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 15:51-57,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The blindness of Israel. Rom. 11:25. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For I do not want you, brethren, to be uninformed of this
mystery—so that you will not be wise in your own estimation—that a partial
hardening has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come
in;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 11:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Kingdom of Heaven. Matt. 13. Jesus is talking to Jews
in the Age of Israel.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the disciples came and said to Him, &quot;Why do You speak
to them in parables?&quot; Jesus answered them, &quot;To you it has been
granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not
been granted.” (Matthew 13:10-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the
field, which a man found and hid again; and from joy over it he goes and sells
all that he has and buys that field.” (Matthew 13:44, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every time one finds the word “mystery’ in the New
Testament, it pertains to some fact of the Church Age. The doctrine of the
mystery is the doctrine of the dispensation of the Church. The reason the
doctrine is called “mystery” is because these truths were not revealed in the
Old Testament. Nowhere in the Old Testament is there Church Age truth. The Old
Testament was a time of detailed information with regard to many things - the
death of Jesus Christ, His burial, resurrection, ascension, and session at the
right hand of the Father. Rom. 16:25-26; Eph. 3:1-6; Col. 1:25-26. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Now to Him who is able to establish you according to my gospel
and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery
which has been kept secret for long ages past, but now is manifested, and by
the Scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal
God, has been made known to all the nations, leading to obedience of faith;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
16:25-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the
sake of you Gentiles— if indeed you have heard of the stewardship of God's
grace which was given to me for you; that by revelation there was made known to
me the mystery, as I wrote before in brief. By referring to this, when you read
you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ, which in other
generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed
to His holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit; to be specific, that the
Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers
of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel,” (Ephesians 3:1-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Of this church I was made a minister according to the
stewardship from God bestowed on me for your benefit, so that I might fully
carry out the preaching of the word of God, that is, the mystery which has been
hidden from the past ages and generations, but has now been manifested to His
saints,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Colossians 1:25-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Then, when chronologically, you would start the Church
Age, you skip right over that area into the Tribulation to the Second Advent,
and the Millennial reign of Jesus Christ in the earth. Therefore, any
information pertinent to the Church Age was not revealed.</p>
