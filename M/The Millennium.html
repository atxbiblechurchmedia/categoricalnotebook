<h2><a name="_The_Millennium"></a><a name="_D-The_Millennium"></a>The
Millennium</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Millennium is the future dispensation where Jesus
Christ will reign on earth for 1,000 literal years. The age begins following
the Second Advent of our Lord Jesus Christ who will rescue the remaining
believers on the earth and will remove Satan and all of his fallen angles from
the earth and imprison them in the Abyss. Our Lord will also remove all
unbelievers from the earth. The diagram below shows the Millennium as the last
dispensation of human history.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><img width=600 height=340 id="Picture 1"
src="The%20Millennium.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Panorama of the Millennium </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Christ reigning forever was promised in the Davidic
Covenant. 2 Sam. 7:8-17; Psalms 89:20-37.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Your house and your kingdom shall endure before Me forever;
your throne shall be established forever.”‘““  (2 Samuel 7:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““So I will establish his descendants forever And his throne as
the days of heaven. “If his sons forsake My law And do not walk in My
judgments, If they violate My statutes And do not keep My commandments, Then I
will punish their transgression with the rod And their iniquity with stripes.
“But I will not break off My lovingkindness from him, Nor deal falsely in My
faithfulness. “My covenant I will not violate, Nor will I alter the utterance
of My lips. “Once I have sworn by My holiness; I will not lie to David. “His
descendants shall endure forever And his throne as the sun before Me.”  (Psalms
89:29-36, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Millennium was prophesied. Isaiah 2:1-5; Isaiah 11; Isaiah
35; Isaiah 62; Isaiah 65; Isaiah 66. </p>

<p class=Verses>“The word which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and
Jerusalem. Now it will come about that In the last days The mountain of the
house of the LORD Will be established as the chief of the mountains, And will
be raised above the hills; And all the nations will stream to it. And many
peoples will come and say, “Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, To
the house of the God of Jacob; That He may teach us concerning His ways And
that we may walk in His paths.” For the law will go forth from Zion And the
word of the LORD from Jerusalem. And He will judge between the nations, And
will render decisions for many peoples; And they will hammer their swords into
plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not lift up sword
against nation, And never again will they learn war. Come, house of Jacob, and
let us walk in the light of the LORD.”  (Isaiah 2:1-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Millennium was presented by our Lord Jesus Christ in His
Sermon on the Mount in Matthew, Mark, and Luke.  During the First Advent, Jesus
Christ, the King was on the earth and was presented as the King.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Millennium was postponed by the rejection of Jesus
Christ as the Messiah. The Church Age was inserted to prepare the royal family
of God, the Body of Christ composed of all Church Age believers. The Church Age
is the postponement of the reign of Christ on the earth. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Millennium will be proclaimed by angelic heralds and
by human heralds - Moses and Elijah. Rev. 10; Rev. 11:1-4. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then there was given me a measuring rod like a staff; and
someone said, “Get up and measure the temple of God and the altar, and those
who worship in it. “Leave out the court which is outside the temple and do not
measure it, for it has been given to the nations; and they will tread under
foot the holy city for forty-two months. “And I will grant authority to my two
witnesses, and they will prophesy for twelve hundred and sixty days, clothed in
sackcloth.” These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand
before the Lord of the earth.”  (Revelation 11:1-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Millennium will be plagiarized by Satan in his man
the Jewish dictator of the land of Palestine and will try to get a jump on the
true Kingdom of Christ. He (the 2nd Antichrist) of Rev. 13:11-18 will try to pass
himself off as the false Messiah. Don’t confuse the Anti-Christ of the revived
Roman Empire and this man (the false prophet).</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth; and he
had two horns like a lamb and he spoke as a dragon. He exercises all the
authority of the first beast in his presence. And he makes the earth and those
who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose fatal wound was healed. He
performs great signs, so that he even makes fire come down out of heaven to the
earth in the presence of men. And he deceives those who dwell on the earth
because of the signs which it was given him to perform in the presence of the
beast, telling those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast who
had the wound of the sword and has come to life. And it was given to him to
give breath to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast would
even speak and cause as many as do not worship the image of the beast to be
killed. And he causes all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor,
and the free men and the slaves, to be given a mark on their right hand or on
their forehead, and he provides that no one will be able to buy or to sell,
except the one who has the mark, either the name of the beast or the number of
his name. Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of
the beast, for the number is that of a man; and his number is six hundred and
sixty-six.”  (Revelation 13:11-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Millennium will be provided by the Second Advent of
Jesus Christ and perfected during His reign. Rev. 11:15-19; Rev. 19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the seventh angel sounded; and there were loud voices in
heaven, saying, “The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord
and of His Christ; and He will reign forever and ever.” And the twenty-four
elders, who sit on their thrones before God, fell on their faces and worshiped
God, saying, “We give You thanks, O Lord God, the Almighty, who are and who
were, because You have taken Your great power and have begun to reign. “And the
nations were enraged, and Your wrath came, and the time came for the dead to be
judged, and the time to reward Your bond-servants the prophets and the saints
and those who fear Your name, the small and the great, and to destroy those who
destroy the earth.” And the temple of God which is in heaven was opened; and the
ark of His covenant appeared in His temple, and there were flashes of lightning
and sounds and peals of thunder and an earthquake and a great hailstorm.” 
(Revelation 11:15-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Characteristics of the Millennium</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Millennium will be a unique dispensation and is best
described by its unique characteristics.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Jesus Christ, the God-man, will rule in the Millennium
</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>No angels will rule in the Millennium. They may serve,
but no rulership. In Hebrews 2:5, “the world to come” refers to the inhabited
world during the Millennium. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For He did not subject to angels the world to come, concerning
which we are speaking.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 2:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ will rule the earth for 1,000 literal years
in the Millennium with delegated rule to Church Age believers in resurrection
bodies. Rev. 20:2-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And he laid hold of the dragon, the serpent of old, who
is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years; and he threw him
into the abyss, and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he would not
deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were completed; after
these things he must be released for a short time. Then I saw thrones, and they
sat on them, and judgment was given to them. And I saw the souls of those who
had been beheaded because of their testimony of Jesus and because of the word
of God, and those who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not
received the mark on their forehead and on their hand; and they came to life
and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.&quot;  (Revelation 20:2-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Population Explosion </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There will be a population explosion because of perfect
environment and no death. The earth will be able to support a large population
during the Millennium. However, during the Church Age, the earth cannot handle
a vast population of people. Human history has proven that there are three ways
that population explosions are reduced - famine (wide-spread starvation),
pestilence (disease, plagues, pandemics), and war (millions die this way). </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>No Violence </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There will be no violence in the Millennium because<b> </b>Satan
and all fallen angels will be removed from the earth and will be incarcerated
in the Abyss for 1000 years. Col. 2:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When He had disarmed the rulers and authorities, He made
a public display of them, having triumphed over them through Him.&quot; 
(Colossians 2:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>No Religion </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This dispensation is characterized by the absence of
religion on earth. Only Christianity will exist. Religion will be abolished
because Satan will be bound in the Abyss as will all fallen angels. As a
result, there will be great spirituality for believers in physical bodies who
enter the Millennium. 1 Cor. 10:20-21; Rev. 20:1-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;No, but I say that the things which the Gentiles
sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God; and I do not want you to
become sharers in demons. You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of
demons; you cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of
demons.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 10:20-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding the
key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold of the dragon,
the serpent of old, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand
years; and he threw him into the abyss, and shut it and sealed it over him, so
that he would not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were
completed; after these things he must be released for a short time.&quot; 
(Revelation 20:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Spirituality Changes to Include Ecstatics </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spirituality will still be due to the filling of the Holy
Spirit, but will include ecstatics and emotion, since Christ will be personally
present on the earth. This will be the greatest period of spirituality ever
known on the earth. Joel 2:28-29; Isaiah 65:24; Zech. 14:16-17. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;It will come about after this That I will pour out
My Spirit on all mankind; And your sons and daughters will prophesy, Your old
men will dream dreams, Your young men will see visions. &quot;Even on the male
and female servants I will pour out My Spirit in those days.&quot;  (Joel
2:28-29, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““It will also come to pass that before they call, I will
answer; and while they are still speaking, I will hear.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah
65:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then it will come about that any who are left of all the
nations that went against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the
King, the LORD of hosts, and to celebrate the Feast of Booths. And it will be
that whichever of the families of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem to
worship the King, the LORD of hosts, there will be no rain on them.” (Zechariah
14:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>False Doctrine Will be Removed</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>False doctrine will be removed because the fallen angels
will have been removed. 1 Tim. 4:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some
will fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and
doctrines of demons,&quot;  (1 Timothy 4:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>All Worship Will Be Centered in Jerusalem in the
Millennial Temple </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>People will route through Jerusalem from the ends of the
world. Gentiles will visit Jerusalem. Jews will show them around and will
explain the meaning of the sacrifices. It will be a means of evangelism as well,
even as it was in the past. Ezek. 40-48.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Israel Will Be Restored as a Nation of Believers </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Israel will be restored as a nation of God. They were
dispersed until the Second Advent. Present day Zionism is of Satan. Zech.
8:20-23; Isaiah 35:3-10; Isaiah 11:10-16; Isaiah 65:17-25. </p>

<p class=Verses>““Thus says the LORD of hosts, ‘It will yet be that peoples
will come, even the inhabitants of many cities. ‘The inhabitants of one will go
to another, saying, “Let us go at once to entreat the favor of the LORD, and to
seek the LORD of hosts; I will also go.” ‘So many peoples and mighty nations
will come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem and to entreat the favor of
the LORD.’ “Thus says the LORD of hosts, ‘In those days ten men from all the
nations will grasp the garment of a Jew, saying, “Let us go with you, for we
have heard that God is with you.”‘““&nbsp;&nbsp;(Zechariah 8:20-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i><span style='color:blue'>““I will also rejoice in
Jerusalem and be glad in My people; And there will no longer be heard in her
The voice of weeping and the sound of crying.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah 65:19, NASB)</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Universal Peace - No War and No Military</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There will be 1,000 years of no war with no military on
earth. Jesus Christ as the ruler will abolish war. Psalms 46:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He makes wars to cease to the end of the earth; He breaks the
bow and cuts the spear in two; He burns the chariots with fire.” (Psalms 46:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Isaiah 2:2-4, “in the last days” refers to the
Millennium, “mountains” refers to government and “above the hills” refers to
Jerusalem, that will be the headquarters of the world. In the Millennium, Jesus
Christ will judge between nations and render decisions for people. Universalism
will be on a bona fide scale for the first time. When Christ reigns,
internationalism will be legitimate as Christ will be the sole ruler. There
will be true world-wide peace. Hosea 2:18; Micah 4:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now it will come about that In the last days The mountain of
the house of the LORD Will be established as the chief of the mountains, And
will be raised above the hills; And all the nations will stream to it. And many
peoples will come and say, “Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, To
the house of the God of Jacob; That He may teach us concerning His ways And
that we may walk in His paths.” For the law will go forth from Zion And the
word of the LORD from Jerusalem. And He will judge between the nations, And
will render decisions for many peoples; And they will hammer their swords into
plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not lift up sword
against nation, And never again will they learn war.”  (Isaiah 2:2-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““In that day I will also make a covenant for them With the
beasts of the field, The birds of the sky And the creeping things of the
ground. And I will abolish the bow, the sword and war from the land, And will
make them lie down in safety.”  (Hosea 2:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He will judge between many peoples And render decisions
for mighty, distant nations. Then they will hammer their swords into plowshares
And their spears into pruning hooks; Nation will not lift up sword against
nation, And never again will they train for war.”  (Micah 4:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Universal Prosperity </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Business will go on as usual, except there will be a
perfect balance of supply and demand. There will be abundant food with no
starvation or poverty. In Psalms 72:1-7, “the king’s son” and “he” both refer
to the Lord Jesus Christ. This passage uses an agricultural economy as the
illustration of universal prosperity. Psalms 72:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“A Psalm of Solomon. Give the king Your judgments, O God, And
Your righteousness to the king’s son. May he judge Your people with
righteousness And Your afflicted with justice. Let the mountains bring peace to
the people, And the hills, in righteousness. May he vindicate the afflicted of
the people, Save the children of the needy And crush the oppressor. Let them
fear You while the sun endures, And as long as the moon, throughout all
generations. May he come down like rain upon the mown grass, Like showers that
water the earth. In his days may the righteous flourish, And abundance of peace
till the moon is no more.”  (Psalms 72:1-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“May there be abundance of grain in the earth on top of the
mountains; Its fruit will wave like the cedars of Lebanon; And may those from
the city flourish like vegetation of the earth.”  (Psalms 72:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Universal Knowledge of God </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Isaiah 11:1, “a shoot” refers to the Second Advent of
Jesus Christ and the “stem of Jesse” refers to Israel today. Isaiah 11:2 refers
to the First Advent of Jesus Christ. Isaiah 11:3 states that Jesus Christ will
judge based on His omniscience. In Isaiah 11:4, “rod of His mouth” refers to
the Second Advent of Jesus Christ and His Millennial rule. In Isaiah 11:8,
“viper’s den” refers to a spitting cobra. Isaiah 11:9 states that there will be
maximum knowledge of Bible doctrine. As always, salvation will be the same
faith alone in Jesus Christ alone. Isaiah 11:1-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then a shoot will spring from the stem of Jesse, And a branch
from his roots will bear fruit. The Spirit of the LORD will rest on Him, The
spirit of wisdom and understanding, The spirit of counsel and strength, The
spirit of knowledge and the fear of the LORD. And He will delight in the fear
of the LORD, And He will not judge by what His eyes see, Nor make a decision by
what His ears hear; But with righteousness He will judge the poor, And decide
with fairness for the afflicted of the earth; And He will strike the earth with
the rod of His mouth, And with the breath of His lips He will slay the wicked.
Also righteousness will be the belt about His loins, And faithfulness the belt
about His waist. And the wolf will dwell with the lamb, And the leopard will
lie down with the young goat, And the calf and the young lion and the fatling
together; And a little boy will lead them. Also the cow and the bear will
graze, Their young will lie down together, And the lion will eat straw like the
ox. The nursing child will play by the hole of the cobra, And the weaned child
will put his hand on the viper’s den. They will not hurt or destroy in all My
holy mountain, For the earth will be full of the knowledge of the LORD As the
waters cover the sea. Then in that day The nations will resort to the root of
Jesse, Who will stand as a signal for the peoples; And His resting place will
be glorious.”  (Isaiah 11:1-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Radical Change in Nature – Perfect Environment</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the Second Advent of Jesus Christ, Satan and the
fallen angels will be removed from the earth and imprisoned in Tartarus – the
Abyss. This plus the rulership of Christ during the Millennium results in perfect
environment. There will be perfect environment on earth just as it was prior to
the fall of Man in the Garden. Religion will not exist. As long as angels rule
the world (Satan et al.), you will never have world peace. You will have
poverty in the world and you will never see perfect environment. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 15:24-25, “He has abolished all rule and
all authority and power” refers to Jesus Christ’s removal of Satan and all
fallen angels from heaven and from the earth and their imprisonment in the
Abyss. Satan and demons will have no presence on the earth for those 1,000
years. The fallen angels will remain imprisoned until the end of the Millennium.
Only Satan will be allowed access to the earth for a short time at the end of
the Millennium to lead the Gog and Magog Revolution composed of unbelievers
living at that time. Rev. 20:2-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;then comes the end, when He hands over the kingdom to the
God and Father, when He has abolished all rule and all authority and power. For
He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet.&quot;  (1
Corinthians 15:24-25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And he laid hold of the dragon, the serpent of old, who
is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years; and he threw him
into the abyss, and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he would not
deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were completed; after
these things he must be released for a short time.&quot;  (Revelation 20:2-3,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Creation will be loosened from the bondage of sin. Nature
will be redeemed. Rom. 8:18-22. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are
not worthy to be compared with the glory that is to be revealed to us. For the
anxious longing of the creation waits eagerly for the revealing of the sons of
God. For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of
Him who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself also will be set free
from its slavery to corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of
God. For we know that the whole creation groans and suffers the pains of
childbirth together until now.”  (Romans 8:18-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Animals Will Lose Their Ferocity </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All animals on earth will lose their ferocity. Isaiah
11:6-9; Isaiah 65:25. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And the wolf will dwell with the lamb, And the leopard will
lie down with the young goat, And the calf and the young lion and the fatling
together; And a little boy will lead them. Also the cow and the bear will
graze, Their young will lie down together, And the lion will eat straw like the
ox. The nursing child will play by the hole of the cobra, And the weaned child
will put his hand on the viper’s den. They will not hurt or destroy in all My
holy mountain, For the earth will be full of the knowledge of the LORD As the
waters cover the sea.”  (Isaiah 11:6-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““The wolf and the lamb will graze together, and the lion will
eat straw like the ox; and dust will be the serpent’s food. They will do no
evil or harm in all My holy mountain,” says the LORD.”  (Isaiah 65:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Plant Life Will Abound in Perfect Weather </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Plant life on earth will abound in perfect weather
globally. There will be no deserts on earth during the Millennium. Isaiah
35:1-2; Isaiah 35:7; Rom. 8:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The wilderness and the desert will be glad, And the Arabah
will rejoice and blossom; Like the crocus It will blossom profusely And rejoice
with rejoicing and shout of joy. The glory of Lebanon will be given to it, The
majesty of Carmel and Sharon. They will see the glory of the LORD, The majesty
of our God.”  (Isaiah 35:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The scorched land will become a pool And the thirsty ground
springs of water; In the haunt of jackals, its resting place, Grass becomes
reeds and rushes.”  (Isaiah 35:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Perfect Justice </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There will be perfect justice by a perfect omniscient
judge – Jesus Christ. Perfect justice will be available to all. Murder will be
rare because of the restraint in the Millennium. It will be the unbeliever who
is murdered. The Lord Jesus Christ will be present. He is omniscient and will
be visible. Church Age believers will have resurrection bodies and angels will
be observing. Isaiah 11:3-5; Psalms 72:12-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He will delight in the fear of the LORD, And He will not
judge by what His eyes see, Nor make a decision by what His ears hear; But with
righteousness He will judge the poor, And decide with fairness for the
afflicted of the earth; And He will strike the earth with the rod of His mouth,
And with the breath of His lips He will slay the wicked. Also righteousness
will be the belt about His loins, And faithfulness the belt about His waist.” 
(Isaiah 11:3-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For he will deliver the needy when he cries for help, The
afflicted also, and him who has no helper. He will have compassion on the poor
and needy, And the lives of the needy he will save. He will rescue their life
from oppression and violence, And their blood will be precious in his sight;” 
(Psalms 72:12-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Perfect World Government </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Millennium will have perfect world government under
Jesus Christ when all functions of government will be headed up through Jesus
Christ. He will delegate leadership and authority functions to Church Age
believers in resurrection bodies who advanced in their spiritual lives while on
earth.<span style='color:red'> </span> Zech. 14:9; Isaiah 11:1-2; Psalms 72; 2

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Extended Human Lifespan  </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There will be little death except for capital punishment
for criminals. Largely, everyone will live through the entire Millennium.
Everyone will have perfect health. There will be no such thing as starvation. There
will still be a little crime because the old sin nature will still exist in
those born during the Millennium. There will be no jails since the enforcement
of capital punishment will discourage most crime. Isaiah 65:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>““No longer will there be in it an infant who lives but a few
days, Or an old man who does not live out his days; For the youth will die at
the age of one hundred And the one who does not reach the age of one hundred
Will be thought accursed.”  (Isaiah 65:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Millennium Compared With The Eternal State</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Millennium </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The sun will shine. Food and survival will be dependent

unbelievers. Zech. 14:11; Zech. 12:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“People will live in it, and there will no longer be a curse,
for Jerusalem will dwell in security.”  (Zechariah 14:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““In that day I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot

the right hand and on the left all the surrounding peoples, while the
inhabitants of Jerusalem again dwell on their own sites in Jerusalem.” 
(Zechariah 12:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There will be numerous trees for food and healing. Ezek.
47:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>““By the river on its bank, on one side and on the other, will
grow all kinds of trees for food. Their leaves will not wither and their fruit

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There will be no sun or moon as the glory of Jesus Christ

<p class=Verses>&quot;And the city has no need of the sun or of the moon to
shine on it, for the glory of God has illumined it, and its lamp is the

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Millennial Jerusalem Compared With the Eternal
Jerusalem</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Millennial Jerusalem</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There will be no walls. Jesus Christ will be a wall of
fire. Zech. 2:4-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and said to him, “Run, speak to that young man, saying,
‘Jerusalem will be inhabited without walls because of the multitude of men and
cattle within it. ‘For I,’ declares the LORD, ‘will be a wall of fire around
her, and I will be the glory in her midst.’”“  (Zechariah 2:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There will be a Millennial temple in Jerusalem. Ezek.
40-48. There will be blood sacrifices in the Millennium. Ezek. 40-48. This is
comparable to the Eucharist, looking back instead of forward, as Israel did
before the Cross (Shadow Christology). Living water will come out of the temple
in Jerusalem. Ezek. 47:1-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then he brought me back to the door of the house; and behold,
water was flowing from under the threshold of the house toward the east, for
the house faced east. And the water was flowing down from under, from the right
side of the house, from south of the altar.”  (Ezekiel 47:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Eternal Jerusalem</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Eternal Jerusalem will have walls. Rev. 21:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“It had a great and high wall, with twelve gates, and at the
gates twelve angels; and names were written on them, which are the names of the
twelve tribes of the sons of Israel.”  (Revelation 21:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There will be no temple. Rev. 21:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God the Almighty and the
Lamb are its temple.”  (Revelation 21:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There will no longer be sacrifices as in the Old
Testament and the Millennium. The water of life will come out of the throne of
God. Rev. 22:1. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then he showed me a river of the water of life, clear as
crystal, coming from the throne of God and of the Lamb,”  (Revelation 22:1,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are further descriptions of the eternal state in
Revelation 21:9 through Revelation 22:5.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Revolt at the End of the Millennium</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The cause of the greatest revolt in history will be
Satan, who is very persuasive and will be loosed from the bottomless pit (the
Abyss) at the end of the Millennium. Satan will be released to deceive the unbelievers
living on the earth after 1,000 years of perfect environment and after every
unbeliever has had a chance to be saved. Some will have turned it down. Rev.
20:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“When the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released
from his prison,”  (Revelation 20:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first coming of Satan was in the Garden in Genesis 3.
He found perfect man in perfect environment and spoiled it. The second coming
of Satan will be at the end of the Millennium. He will find man again in
perfect environment and will spoil it. While Satan always promises perfect
environment as the solution to man’s problems, he always manages to destroy it
with his system based on lies. Satan always promises more than he can perform.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The devil promotes the idea that man, by his own efforts,
can introduce a golden age. Satan’s deceptive methods include convincing man
that their efforts to improve the environment will solve all of their problems.
Satan promotes eliminating the weak and unfit. He promotes education,
reformation, and better social understanding as the means to solve man’s
problems. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Both the termination of the 1,000 years and the release
of Satan will be under the control of God. The purpose of God in letting Satan
loose is to demonstrate that the only answer to man’s problems is salvation or
regeneration. Satan cannot accomplish this.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is no such thing as a collective solution to man’s
problems apart from the personal solution to man’s problems - regeneration. Perfect
environment without regeneration is not the answer to man’s problems because
there will still be unsaved people at the end of the Millennium. Rev. 20:8-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four
corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for the war; the
number of them is like the sand of the seashore. And they came up on the broad
plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city,
and fire came down from heaven and devoured them.”  (Revelation 20:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan will have a short time to persuade unbelievers to
follow him in opposition to the perfect environment created by Christ. In the
garden of Eden, there was a rejection of perfect environment. At the end of the
Millennium, we will have a revolt against perfect environment. Perfect
environment is not the solution to the man’s problems. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There will be a fantastic number of unbelievers at the
end of the Millennium who follow Satan into revolt against perfect environment.
“Gog and Magog” is the title for this mass revolt lead by Satan. Ezekiel 38-39
speaks of Gog of Magog (Hebrew Word) and is a reference to a geographical
location prior to the Millennium. The king of the North is said to be Gog of
Magog in Ezekiel and he is said to be in a certain geographical location. Gog
of Magog was killed by the sword of one person. Revelation 20 speaks of Gog and
Magog and is a reference to many people, after the Millennium. Gog and Magog
(mass of people) will be killed by fire.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There will be no weapons during the 1000 literal years of
the Millennium. However, it seems that weapons will be used at this time
because of the word “war.” In Revelation 20:8, the phrase “gather them for the
war” indicates that upon Satan’s loosing after the 1000 years of the Millennium
are over, weapons will be quickly constructed. Rev. 20:7. </p>

<p class=Verses>“When the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released
from his prison,”  (Revelation 20:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This revolt will be concentrated in Jerusalem referred to
as the “beloved city.” This indicates that at that time there will be strong
anti-Semitism. This revolt will be Satan’s final effort. If God fails to keep
His promise to Israel, then Satan could still win.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Fire causes the physical death of these unbelievers that
Satan will gather together. This will finish physical death. This is the last
enemy to be put under the feet of Jesus Christ. Satan has already been judged. Inoperative
demons were given the victorious proclamation. Fallen angels have already been
removed from the earth. The physical death of all remaining unbelievers will be
the last physical deaths. 1 Cor. 15:24-28.</p>

<p class=Verses>“then comes the end, when He hands over the kingdom to the God
and Father, when He has abolished all rule and all authority and power. For He
must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet. The last enemy that
will be abolished is death. For HE HAS PUT ALL THINGS IN SUBJECTION UNDER HIS
FEET. But when He says, “All things are put in subjection,” it is evident that
He is excepted who put all things in subjection to Him. When all things are
subjected to Him, then the Son Himself also will be subjected to the One who
subjected all things to Him, so that God may be all in all.”  (1 Corinthians
15:24-28, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Judgments at the End of the Millennium</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is at the end of the Millennium where Jesus Christ
completes the subjugation of and final triumph over all of His enemies. Psalms
110:1; Heb. 10:12-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;A Psalm of David. The LORD says to my Lord: &quot;Sit at
My right hand Until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.&quot;&quot; 
(Psalms 110:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;but He, having offered one sacrifice for sins for all
time, SAT DOWN AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD, waiting from that time onward UNTIL
HIS ENEMIES BE MADE A FOOTSTOOL FOR HIS FEET. For by one offering He has
perfected for all time those who are sanctified.&quot;  (Hebrews 10:12-14,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first to be judged will be Satan. Satan pleaded “not
guilty” for himself and fallen angels at the first fall of Satan. God had
already sentenced Satan and fallen angels prior to the creation of mankind.
This sentence will be carried out at the end of the Millennium. Matt. 25:41.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Then He will also say to those on His left, ‘Depart from Me,
accursed ones, into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and
his angels;”  (Matthew 25:41, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan will be the third occupant of the Lake of Fire. All
of the remaining fallen angels will also be cast into the Lake of Fire. The
first to be sent to the Lake of Fire will be the First Beast or the Dictator of
the Revived Roman Empire at the Second Advent of Jesus Christ. The second to be
sent to the Lake of Fire will be the Second Beast (a.k.a. False Prophet, the
Dictator of the Holy Land) at the Second Advent of Jesus Christ. Rev. 13; Rev.
20:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of
fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also; and they
will be tormented day and night forever and ever.”  (Revelation 20:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Fallen angels will be judged and thrown into the Lake of
Fire. Matt. 25:41.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Then He will also say to those on His left, ‘Depart from Me,
accursed ones, into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and
his angels;”  (Matthew 25:41, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the Great White Throne Judgment, Jesus Christ will judge
all unbelievers according to their good deeds and works. Rev 20:11-15. This
fulfills God's judgment found in John 3:18 and John 3:36.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat upon it,
from whose presence earth and heaven fled away, and no place was found for
them. And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne,
and books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life;
and the dead were judged from the things which were written in the books,
according to their deeds. And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and
death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged,
every one of them according to their deeds. Then death and Hades were thrown
into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire. And if
anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the
lake of fire.&quot;  (Revelation 20:11-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;He who believes in Him is not judged; he who does
not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of
the only begotten Son of God.&quot;  (John 3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he
who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on
him.&quot;&quot;  (John 3:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believers in physical bodies on earth at the end of
the Millennium will come through these judgments unscathed. This is the
faithfulness of God. Judgment of Millennial believers will be similar to that
for Church Age believers at the Judgment Seat of Christ prior to the Second
Advent. However, Millennial believers will be judged or evaluated at the end of
the Millennium and then will receive their resurrection bodies before eternity
is ushered in. Rev. 11:18; 1 Cor. 3:12-15.</p>

<p class=Verses>““And the nations were enraged, and Your wrath came, and the
time came for the dead to be judged, and the time to reward Your bond-servants
the prophets and the saints and those who fear Your name, the small and the
great, and to destroy those who destroy the earth.”“  (Revelation 11:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold, silver,
precious stones, wood, hay, straw, each man’s work will become evident; for the
day will show it because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire itself
will test the quality of each man’s work. If any man’s work which he has built
on it remains, he will receive a reward. If any man’s work is burned up, he
will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.”  (1
Corinthians 3:12-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Judgment of the universe will be complete destruction.
Rev. 20:11; 2 Peter 3:10-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat upon it, from
whose presence earth and heaven fled away, and no place was found for them.” 
(Revelation 20:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, in which the
heavens will pass away with a roar and the elements will be destroyed with
intense heat, and the earth and its works will be burned up. Since all these
things are to be destroyed in this way, what sort of people ought you to be in
holy conduct and godliness, looking for and hastening the coming of the day of
God, because of which the heavens will be destroyed by burning, and the
elements will melt with intense heat!”  (2 Peter 3:10-12, NASB)</p>
