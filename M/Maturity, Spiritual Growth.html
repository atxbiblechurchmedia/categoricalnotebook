<h2>Maturity, Spiritual Growth</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The people mentioned in Hebrews 5:11-14 were dull of
hearing, ignorant of Bible doctrine, lacked skill in the Word of God, and
needed to grow up spiritually. Some selected basic Bible doctrines.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Concerning him we have much to say, and it is hard to explain,
since you have become dull of hearing. For though by this time you ought to be
teachers, you have need again for someone to teach you the elementary
principles of the oracles of God, and you have come to need milk and not solid
food. For everyone who partakes only of milk is not accustomed to the word of
righteousness, for he is an infant. But solid food is for the mature, who
because of practice have their senses trained to discern good and evil.” 
(Hebrews 5:11-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 6:1-3, “leaving” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span
lang=EL>φι</span>́<span lang=EL>ημι</span> (aphiēmi) and means to keep on
moving. “Press on” is the present passive subjunctive of <span lang=EL>φε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ρω</span> (pherō̄) and means to keep on moving to maturity. The
subject receives the action from the main verb. You receive maturity as you get
more doctrine. It is volitional, potential only as you stay positive. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore leaving the elementary teaching about the Christ,
let us press on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from
dead works and of faith toward God, of instruction about washings and laying on
of hands, and the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment. And this we
will do, if God permits.”  (Hebrews 6:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Maturity” is <span lang=EL>τελειο</span>́<span lang=EL>της</span>
(teleiotēs) and means fully grown, mature, adult, completed. “Not laying again
a foundation” is <span lang=EL>θεμε</span>́<span lang=EL>λιος</span>
(themelios) and means elementary teaching. The doctrines mentioned had to do
with the problems that Jewish Christians faced just before the Fifth Cycle of
Discipline to Israel that occurred in 70 AD.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Repentance” is <span lang=EL>μετα</span>́<span lang=EL>νοια</span>
(metanoia) and means change of thinking. They could not distinguish the shadow
from the substance, between Old Testament Christology and the historical New
Testament Christology. At salvation, the believer changes their attitude toward
the person and work of Christ. The ministry of the Holy Spirit causes a change
or renovation of thinking. 1 Cor. 2:14-15; John 16:8-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of
God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because
they are spiritually appraised. But he who is spiritual appraises all things,
yet he himself is appraised by no one.”  (1 Corinthians 2:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“ “And He, when He comes, will convict the world concerning sin
and righteousness and judgment; concerning sin, because they do not believe in
Me; and concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father and you no longer
see Me; and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been
judged. “  (John 16:8-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Finally the believer’s repentance from dead work in this
context. Dead works refers to human good. This is human good produced from the
area of strength from the old sin nature. The old sin nature produces only dead
works! Human good is anything you do as a believer out of fellowship. This can
include activities that are normally associated with spiritualty such as
giving, teaching a Sunday school class, worship, witnessing, etc. Anything done
while out of fellowship is human good.</p>
