<h2>Marriage by Charles H. Spurgeon</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>From the Autobiography of Charles H. Spurgeon, Volume
2, page 185.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is probably the finest, concise, summarization of a
marriage founded on Biblical truth. Here the marriage partners would be
doctrinally grounded and also to apply doctrine to experience through the
techniques.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Sometimes we have seen a model marriage, founded on pure
love, and cemented in mutual esteem. Therein the husband acts as a tender head;
and the wife, as a true spouse, realized the model marriage-relation, and sets
forth what our oneness with the Lord ought to be. She delights in her husband,
in his person, his character, his affection. To her, he is not only the chief
and foremost of mankind, but in her eyes he is all-in-all. Her heart’s love
belongs to him and to him only. She finds sweetest content and solace in his
company, his fellowship, his fondness. He is her little world, her Paradise,
her choice treasure. At any time, she would gladly lay aside her own pleasure
to find it doubled in gratifying him.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>She is glad to sink her individuality in his. She seeks
no renown for herself. His honor is reflected upon her and she rejoices in it.
She would defend his name with her dying breath. Safe enough is he when she can
speak for him. The domestic circle is her kingdom; that she may there create
happiness and comfort, is her life-work; and his smiling gratitude is all the
reward she seeks. Even in her dress she thinks of him; without constraint she
consults his taste, and considers nothing beautiful which is distasteful to
him. A tear from his eye, because of any unkindness on her part, would
grievously torment her. She asks not how her behavior may please a stranger or
how another’s judgment may approve her conduct; let her beloved be content and
she is glad.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He has many objectives in life, some of which she does
not quite understand; but she believes in them all and anything she can do to
promote them, she delights to perform. He lavishes love on her and in turn she
lavishes love on him. Their object in life is common. There are points where
their affections so intimately unite that none could tell which is first and
which is second. To watch their children growing up in health and strength, to
see them holding posts of usefulness and honor, is their mutual concern. In
this and other matters, they are fully one. Their wishes blend, their hearts
are indivisible. By degrees, they come to think very much the same thoughts.
Intimate association creates conformity. I have known this to become so
complete that, at the same moment, the same utterance has leaped to their lips.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Happy woman and happy man! If heaven be found on earth,
they have it! At last, the two are so blended, so engrafted on one stem, that
their old age presents a lovely attachment, a common sympathy, by which its
infirmities are greatly alleviated, and its burdens are transformed into fresh
bonds of love. So happy a union of will, sentiment, thought, and heart exists
between them, that the two streams of their life have washed away the dividing
bank, and run on as one broad current of united existence till their common joy
falls into the ocean of eternal felicity.” </p>
