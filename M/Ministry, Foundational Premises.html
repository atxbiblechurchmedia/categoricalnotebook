<h2>Ministry, Foundational Premises</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 11:12, the Judaizers were trying to
build a bona fide ministry on antagonism to the Apostle Paul. You can’t build a
ministry on anti-anything. But since they didn’t have doctrine, they seized
anything that came along to build upon.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But what I am doing I will continue to do, so that I may cut
off opportunity from those who desire an opportunity to be regarded just as we
are in the matter about which they are boasting.” (2 Corinthians 11:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are many ministries today that are built on false
premises like sand for a foundation. There are ministries today built simply on
running down the World Council of Churches. The World Council of Churches and
the National Council of Churches are both totally apostate organizations, but
you can’t build a ministry on running them down. This is the old fundamental
whipping post. It is wrong in every way, but by running down the World Council
of Churches, you don’t have to study the Bible, something else is the issue and
the real issue of Bible doctrine is disregarded.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are ministries today and even politicians who build
their issues on conspiracies. Everything is a conspiracy. They are experts on
what they feel are the major conspiracies. One thing about building your
ministry on conspiracies, you don’t have to study Bible doctrine. They think
they don’t have to teach Bible doctrine because it’s just too boring, so they
just have to crank up something on the conspiracies.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are ministries today built on running down certain
people. This is leading crusades against individuals or groups. Again, you don’t
have to build on Bible doctrine to do that. That is what’s so easy about using these
ministry tricks.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are ministries that are built on being anti-local
church. While the local church may have its own problems to correct, these
anti-local church ministries form to do the work of a local church, but are
always limited to evangelism. Instead of building on Bible doctrine with
emphasis on spiritual gifts, they get away from grace and build on gimmicks.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Many church splits are caused by opposition to certain people,
to certain personalities, or the way the local church is organized. They have
the wrong foundation. Only Bible doctrine will cut it. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are ministries built today on programs. There are
ministries built on involvement with the social problems of the day in order to
find social or human solutions. They are drumming the platform for better
living conditions or ecology. A bona fide ministry is only built on teaching
the whole counsel of the Word of God – Bible doctrine.</p>
