<h2>Levitical Offerings</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Book of Leviticus did not come from Mt. Sinai. Lev.
1:1-2. This was God speaking out of the Tabernacle. This is Codex #2 and speaks
of the Person and Work of Christ. The Hebrew word for “offering” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>קָרְבָּן</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(qorban) and the Hebrew word for “to
bring” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>קרב</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(qârab) means to go
up or ascend, to draw near. This is the basis for the concept of propitiation.
The offering is always going to represent Christ. The Father is only satisfied
with the word of Christ, His Son. The slaying of the offering pictured the future
substitutionary spiritual death of Christ on the Cross.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then the LORD called to Moses and spoke to him from the
tent of meeting, saying, &quot;Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them,
'When any man of you brings an offering to the LORD, you shall bring your
offering of animals from the herd or the flock.&quot;  (Leviticus 1:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Sweet Savor</b> <b>Offerings</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>These offerings portrayed the work and person of the Lord
Jesus Christ on the Cross for salvation. These offerings are considered sweet
by God because they are acceptable to Him (propitiation).</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Burnt Offering or Blood</u>: Lev. 1 (Blood). This
teaches propitiation with emphasis on the salvation work of Jesus Christ on the
Cross. God the Father was propitiated or satisfied with Jesus Christ’s
substitutionary spiritual death on the Cross. The Burnt offering was made from
their free will. Faith in Christ originates from free will. Identification was
made with one who was going to die for him. All offerings were slain. Three
offerings (bullock, flock, and fowl) were made, covering all classes of people,
from rich to poor.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Meat (food, gift) Offering</u>: Lev. 2 (Bread).
Emphasis on the impeccability of the humanity of Jesus Christ. God the Father
gave His Son. Jesus Christ gave Himself. The person made the offering from free
will. Jesus Christ’s work was acceptable because His humanity was acceptable to
God the Father because He had God’s very own perfect righteousness (+R).</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The offering had “fine flour” representing the perfect
humanity of Jesus Christ, “oil” representing the sustaining ministry of the
Holy Spirit, “frankincense” representing production from the perfect character
of Jesus Christ, and “no leaven” representing the impeccability of the humanity
of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Peace Offering</u> - Lev. 3. Emphasis on
reconciliation. Peace between man and God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Non-sweet Savor Offerings</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>These offerings are considered by God to be non-sweet
because they are not satisfactory to Him.  This is the believer’s carnality.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Sin Offering</u>: Lev. 4. Taught confession of sin
with emphasis on unknown sins. Even though we sin through ignorance, we are
still guilty.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Trespass Offering</u>: Lev. 5-6. Also taught confession
of sin with emphasis on known sins. Confession of sin in the Church Age is via
claiming the promise of 1 John 1:9. For the Old Testament believers, they used Psalms
103:12 and Isaiah 43:25.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”  (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“As far as the east is from the west, So far has He removed our
transgressions from us.”  (Psalms 103:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““I, even I, am the one who wipes out your transgressions for
My own sake, And I will not remember your sins.”  (Isaiah 43:25, NASB)</p>
