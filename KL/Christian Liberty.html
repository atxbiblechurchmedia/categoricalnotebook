<h2><a name="_Christian_Liberty"></a><a name="_D-Christian_Liberty"></a>Christian
Liberty</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Christian liberty includes four major laws governing the
conduct of the believer relating to their participation in questionable or
doubtful things. These laws are; the Law of Liberty, the Law of Expediency, the
Law of Love, and the Law of Supreme Sacrifice.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The question of which of the believer’s actions are right
and which are wrong has to do with whether or not the action is specifically
forbidden by the Word. For those actions not specifically forbidden in the
Word, these four basic biblical principles can be used easily discern the
correct application of Bible doctrine to the situation. In each law is the
principle that a believer should never become a stumbling block to another
believer. The believer is never to cater to legalism. Rom. 14:14-15; Rom. 14:20-21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing is
unclean in itself; but to him who thinks anything to be unclean, to him it is
unclean. For if because of food your brother is hurt, you are no longer walking
according to love. Do not destroy with your food him for whom Christ died.” 
(Romans 14:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do not tear down the work of God for the sake of food. All
things indeed are clean, but they are evil for the man who eats and gives
offense. It is good not to eat meat or to drink wine, or to do anything by
which your brother stumbles.”  (Romans 14:20-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Christian liberty for the believer is set forth in many
passages of Scripture. It is done in some passages in contrast to legalism in
one of its many expressions. There are over 66 passages in the Bible that
relate directly with the concept of liberty or freedom for a believer.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Liberty is a concept which basically embraces you as an
individual. It is directed toward self. It results from your personal
relationship and position with Christ, your own personal knowledge of Bible
doctrine, your own personal full persuasion in the mind.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Liberty is based on knowledge of Bible doctrine. Not all
believers have knowledge of Bible doctrine, therefore, not all believers
understand their Christian liberty and their responsibility to others weaker
believers. 1 Cor. 8:4, 1 Cor. 8:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols,
we know that there is no such thing as an idol in the world, and that there is
no God but one.” (1 Corinthians 8:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“However not all men have this knowledge; but some, being
accustomed to the idol until now, eat food as if it were sacrificed to an idol;
and their conscience being weak is defiled.” (1 Corinthians 8:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer who has knowledge of Bible doctrine should understand
their own personal liberty and not allow it to be a stumbling block to another
believer. 1 Cor. 8:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But take care that this liberty of yours does not somehow
become a stumbling block to the weak.” (1 Corinthians 8:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Liberty should not be dogmatically insisted upon if it is
going to cause a weaker believer to fall. 1 Cor. 8:10-13, Gal. 5:13-15. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For if someone sees you, who have knowledge, dining in an
idol's temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be strengthened to eat
things sacrificed to idols? For through your knowledge he who is weak is
ruined, the brother for whose sake Christ died. And so, by sinning against the
brethren and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ.
Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will never eat meat again,
so that I will not cause my brother to stumble.” (1 Corinthians 8:10-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For you were called to freedom, brethren; only do not turn
your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one
another. For the whole Law is fulfilled in one word, in the statement,
&quot;YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.&quot; But if you bite and
devour one another, take care that you are not consumed by one another.”
(Galatians 5:13-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Christian liberty is the object of scrutiny of religious
legalists. Gal. 2:1-14. Those religious legalists who scrutinize the use of
liberty by other believers are called “false brethren” in Galatians 2:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But it was because of the false brethren secretly brought in,
who had sneaked in to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, in
order to bring us into bondage.” (Galatians 2:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The methods of the religious legalists are always done in
what they think is privacy. They seem convinced that no one will understand
their clever subtilties. In Galatians 2:4, “to spy out” is the aorist active
infinitive of purpose of <span lang=EL>κατασκοπε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(kataskopeō) and means to inspect, to spy, to check out carefully. “Bring us
into bondage” is <span lang=EL>καταδουλο</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(katadouloō) and means to enslave utterly, to bring into bondage.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Four Laws of Christian Liberty</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Law of Liberty</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Law of Liberty is directed toward one’s self.  The
Law of Liberty is the believer’s liberty to walk in the Spirit free from the
bondage of sin. The believer has the right to walk in fellowship and to serve
the Lord. The believer has the liberty to operate outside the demands of the
old sin nature. This also includes the liberty to curtail your liberty or to
enjoy it, depending on the situation. However, this is not the liberty to sin.
1 Cor. 6:12, Gal. 5:1, Gal. 5:13. Rom 6:1, Rom 6:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“All things are lawful for me, but not all things are
profitable. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be mastered by
anything.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 6:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“It was for freedom that Christ set us free; therefore keep
standing firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Galatians
5:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For you were called to freedom, brethren; only do not turn
your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one
another.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Galatians 5:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin so that
grace may increase?”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 6:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under
grace? May it never be!”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 6:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Corinth, the debate centered around the meat offering
to idols. The Corinthians believers had liberty to eat this meat for they knew
the idol meant nothing. However, this knowledge can lead to egocentricity. 1
Cor. 8:1-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now concerning things sacrificed to idols, we know that we all
have knowledge. Knowledge makes arrogant, but love edifies. If anyone supposes
that he knows anything, he has not yet known as he ought to know; but if anyone
loves God, he is known by Him. Therefore concerning the eating of things
sacrificed to idols, we know that there is no such thing as an idol in the
world, and that there is no God but one. For even if there are so-called gods
whether in heaven or on earth, as indeed there are many gods and many lords,
yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom are all things and we
exist for Him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we exist
through Him.”  (1 Corinthians 8:1-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Law of Expediency</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Law of Expediency is expressed toward unbelievers. The
Law of Expediency tells us that all believers are witnesses for Jesus Christ
and are to refrain from doing some things, not because they are sin, but
because doing them prevents the unbeliever from seeing the true issue of their
need for salvation. Because of my witness for Jesus Christ to the unbeliever,
there are some things I will choose not do in order to have a testimony with
certain unbelievers. 1 Cor. 6:12, 1 Cor. 9:22, 1 Cor. 10:23-24.</p>

<p class=Verses>“All things are lawful for me, but not all things are
profitable. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be mastered by
anything.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 6:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“To the weak I became weak, that I might win the weak; I have
become all things to all men, so that I may by all means save some.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Corinthians 9:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“All things are lawful, but not all things are profitable. All
things are lawful, but not all things edify. Let no one seek his own good, but
that of his neighbor.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 10:23-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If a Corinthian believer was invited to an unbeliever’s
home, they was not to make an issue out of meat, but to make Jesus Christ the
issue. If the unbeliever made an issue out of the meat, they were to refuse it.
1 Cor. 10:23-33.</p>

<p class=Verses>“All things are lawful, but not all things are profitable. All
things are lawful, but not all things edify. Let no one seek his own good, but
that of his neighbor. Eat anything that is sold in the meat market without
asking questions for conscience’ sake; FOR THE EARTH IS THE LORD’S, AND ALL IT
CONTAINS. If one of the unbelievers invites you and you want to go, eat
anything that is set before you without asking questions for conscience’ sake.
But if anyone says to you, “This is meat sacrificed to idols,” do not eat it,
for the sake of the one who informed you, and for conscience’ sake; I mean not
your own conscience, but the other man’s; for why is my freedom judged by
another’s conscience? If I partake with thankfulness, why am I slandered
concerning that for which I give thanks? Whether, then, you eat or drink or
whatever you do, do all to the glory of God. Give no offense either to Jews or
to Greeks or to the church of God; just as I also please all men in all things,
not seeking my own profit but the profit of the many, so that they may be
saved.”  (1 Corinthians 10:23-33, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Law of Love</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Law of Love is directed toward other believers. The
Law of Love means that because of my personal love for my Savior and
unconditional love for fellow believers, there are certain things which I will
refrain from doing. The Law of Love rules out doing some activities in the
presence of a weaker or immature believer because doing so will cause them to
sin and thus, you become a stumbling block to another believer. By doing what
the Law of Liberty allows in their presence, you become a hindrance to their spiritual
growth. Even though the weaker believer is in error by believing what you are
doing is a sin, you chose to apply the Law of Love and unconditional love for
them and refrain from that activity when they are present. Gal. 5:13, 1 Cor
8:13, 1 Cor. 8:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For you were called to freedom, brethren; only do not turn
your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one
another.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Galatians 5:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will never
eat meat again, so that I will not cause my brother to stumble.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Corinthians 8:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But take care that this liberty of yours does not somehow
become a stumbling block to the weak.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 8:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The maturing believer has the right to do certain things,
but they will refrain from doing them not because they are wrong, but because
of unconditional love (agapao) for the weaker and often legalistic believer.
The maturing believer will refrain from doing certain things to keep the weak
believer from being upset, disturbed or critical, and because they wants to
help other believers rather than hinder them. This is a sign of spiritual
maturity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Corinth, the weaker believer often saw the other
believer in the restaurant where the meat was served. Through the use of the
Law of liberty, the weak brother may get out of temporal fellowship. Actually
you sin against Christ when you cause a fellow believer to get out of
fellowship. The Law of Love is a higher law than the Law of Liberty. 1 Cor.
8:7-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“However not all men have this knowledge; but some, being
accustomed to the idol until now, eat food as if it were sacrificed to an idol;
and their conscience being weak is defiled. But food will not commend us to
God; we are neither the worse if we do not eat, nor the better if we do eat.
But take care that this liberty of yours does not somehow become a stumbling
block to the weak. For if someone sees you, who have knowledge, dining in an
idol’s temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be strengthened to eat
things sacrificed to idols? For through your knowledge he who is weak is
ruined, the brother for whose sake Christ died. And so, by sinning against the
brethren and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ.
Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will never eat meat again,
so that I will not cause my brother to stumble.”  (1 Corinthians 8:7-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Law of Supreme Sacrifice </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Law of Supreme Sacrifice is directed toward God and
is the highest law of Christian behavior. It generally applies to mature
believers to refrain from normal living and legitimate functions in life to
serve the Lord in some special way. There are normal pleasant things in life
that neither the weak believer nor the unbeliever would object too, which will
be set aside to serve the Lord to the maximum.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul functioned under this law in 1 Corinthians 9:1-19.
Under the Law of Supreme Sacrifice, a few normal things in life are voluntarily
set aside when they interfere with concentration on a special ministry or
leadership function in life. This is not to be confused with legalism. See
category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/T/Time%20Utilization.html">Utilization of Time</a>. </p>

<p class=Verses>“My defense to those who examine me is this: Do we not have a
right to eat and drink? Do we not have a right to take along a believing wife,
even as the rest of the apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas? Or do
only Barnabas and I not have a right to refrain from working?” (1 Corinthians
9:3-6, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“If others share the right over you, do we not more?
Nevertheless, we did not use this right, but we endure all things so that we
will cause no hindrance to the gospel of Christ.” (1 Corinthians 9:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“What then is my reward? That, when I preach the gospel, I may
offer the gospel without charge, so as not to make full use of my right in the
gospel. For though I am free from all men, I have made myself a slave to all,
so that I may win more.” (1 Corinthians 9:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Christian Liberty From the Greek and Hebrew Texts</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Liberty related to relaxation.</u> </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Greek term <span lang=EL>α</span>̓́<span lang=EL>νεσις</span>
(anesis) means to loosen, relaxing, relief, rest from persecution, held in less
rigorous confinement, relief from the troubles of poverty. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Anesis</i> means relaxation from persecution in 2
Thessalonians 1:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and to give relief to you who are afflicted and to us as
well when the Lord Jesus will be revealed from heaven with His mighty angels in
flaming fire,&quot;  (2 Thessalonians 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Anesis</i> means relaxation of the mind. 2 Corinthians
2:13 and 2 Corinthians 7:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I had no rest for my spirit, not finding Titus my
brother; but taking my leave of them, I went on to Macedonia.&quot;  (2
Corinthians 2:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For even when we came into Macedonia our flesh had no
rest, but we were afflicted on every side: conflicts without, fears
within.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 7:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Anesis</i> means relaxation of those things confining
you in Acts 24:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then he gave orders to the centurion for him to be kept
in custody and yet have some freedom, and not to prevent any of his friends
from ministering to him.&quot;  (Acts 24:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Anesis</i> means relaxation from the personal poverty
pain in 2 Corinthians 8:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For this is not for the ease of others and for your
affliction, but by way of equality&quot;  (2 Corinthians 8:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Liberty as a Release From Bondage</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 4:18, “release” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓́<span
lang=EL>φεσις</span> (aphesis) and means to release from the oppression of sin.
“Oppressed” is the perfect passive participle of <span lang=EL>θραυ</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (thrauō) and means to be broken by calamity, break in pieces,
shattered, smitten through. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS UPON ME, BECAUSE HE
ANOINTED ME TO PREACH THE GOSPEL TO THE POOR. HE HAS SENT ME TO PROCLAIM
RELEASE TO THE CAPTIVES, AND RECOVERY OF SIGHT TO THE BLIND, TO SET FREE THOSE
WHO ARE OPPRESSED, &quot;  (Luke 4:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Aphesis</i> is used as liberty as a release from
“penalty” of sin in Matthew 26:28, Mark 1:4, Ephesians 1:7, Hebrews 9:22, Hebrews
10:18, and Colossians 1:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; for this is My blood of the covenant, which is poured
out for many for forgiveness of sins. &quot;  (Matthew 26:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness preaching a
baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.&quot;  (Mark 1:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;In Him we have redemption through His blood, the
forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace&quot; 
(Ephesians 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And according to the Law, one may almost say, all things
are cleansed with blood, and without shedding of blood there is no
forgiveness.&quot;  (Hebrews 9:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now where there is forgiveness of these things, there is
no longer any offering for sin.&quot;  (Hebrews 10:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of
sins.&quot;  (Colossians 1:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Positional and Volitional Liberty</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 10:29, “freedom” is  <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span
lang=EL>λευθερι</span>́<span lang=EL>α</span> (eleutheria) and means the
freedom of volition to do or not to do.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I mean not your own conscience, but the other man's; for
why is my freedom judged by another's conscience?&quot;  (1 Corinthians 10:29,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Eleutheria</i> is used as liberty from the law of
Moses in Galatians 2:4, Galatians 5:1, Galatians 13, and 1 Peter 2:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But it was because of the false brethren secretly brought
in, who had sneaked in to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, in
order to bring us into bondage.&quot;  (Galatians 2:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;It was for freedom that Christ set us free; therefore
keep standing firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery.&quot; 
(Galatians 5:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; Act as free men, and do not use your freedom as a
covering for evil, but use it as bondslaves of God.&quot;  (1 Peter 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Eleutheria</i> is used as liberty from Jewish errors
in 2 Corinthians 3:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the
Lord is, there is liberty.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 3:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Eleutheria</i> is used as liberty from the old sin
nature control in James 1:25 and James 2:12.</p>

Nevertheless, we did not use this right, but we endure all things so that we
will cause no hindrance to the gospel of Christ.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 9:12,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;What then is my reward? That, when I preach the gospel, I
may offer the gospel without charge, so as not to make full use of my right in
the gospel.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 9:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;While it remained unsold, did it not remain your
own? And after it was sold, was it not under your control? Why is it that you
have conceived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to men but to
God.&quot;&quot;  (Acts 5:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But take care that this liberty of yours does not somehow
become a stumbling block to the weak.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 8:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Exousia</i> is used as the liberty to give leave or
permission in Revelation 22:14.</p>

have the right to the tree of life, and may enter by the gates into the
city.&quot;  (Revelation 22:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Exousia</i> is used as the ability or strength which
one possesses in Matthew 9:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But when the crowds saw this, they were awestruck, and
glorified God, who had given such authority to men.&quot;  (Matthew 9:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Exousia</i> is used as the authority or right to do
something in Matthew 21:23, Mark 9:28, and Luke 20:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When He entered the temple, the chief priests and the

authority are You doing these things, and who gave You this
authority?&quot;&quot;  (Matthew 21:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When He came into the house, His disciples began
questioning Him privately, &quot;Why could we not drive it out?&quot;&quot; 
(Mark 9:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and they spoke, saying to Him, &quot;Tell us by what

authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. &quot;  (Matthew 28:18,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Exousia</i> is used as delegated authority in Acts
9:14 and Acts 26:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind
all who call on Your name.&quot;&quot;  (Acts 9:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;And this is just what I did in Jerusalem; not only
did I lock up many of the saints in prisons, having received authority from the
chief priests, but also when they were being put to death I cast my vote
against them.&quot;  (Acts 26:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Exousia</i> is used as the authority to manage
domestic affairs in Mark 13:34.</p>

NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Liberty of Termination </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Liberty means more than liberty of position, volition and
authority. It also means the liberty of termination. The Greek word <span
lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>λευ</span>́<span lang=EL>θερος</span>
(eleutheros) has the following expressions of liberty. It is used as having
liberty by birth in John 8:33, Ephesians 5:8, and Colossians 3:11.</p>

Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave and freeman, but
Christ is all, and in all.” (Colossians 3:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Eleutheros</i> is used as one who ceases to be a slave
in 1 Corinthians 7:21. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Were you called while a slave? Do not worry about it; but if
you are able also to become free, rather do that.” (1 Corinthians 7:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Eleutheros</i> is used as one who is not bound by an
obligation in 1 Corinthians 9:1 and Romans 7:3. One is no longer under
obligation so that one may now do what was formerly forbidden by the person or
thing to which one was bound.</p>

our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord?&quot;  (1 Corinthians 9:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So then, if while her husband is living she is joined to
another man, she shall be called an adulteress; but if her husband dies, she is
free from the law, so that she is not an adulteress though she is joined to
another man.&quot;  (Romans 7:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Eleutheros</i> is used as liberty to remarry in 1 Corinthians
7:39. </p>

<p class=Verses>“A wife is bound as long as her husband lives; but if her
husband is dead, she is free to be married to whom she wishes, only in the
Lord.” (1 Corinthians 7:39, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Eleutheros</i> is used as liberty from paying taxes in

the kings of the earth collect customs or poll-tax, from their sons or from
strangers?&quot; When Peter said, &quot;From strangers,&quot; Jesus said to
him, &quot;Then the sons are exempt.” (Matthew 17:25-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Apoluō</i> is used as liberty to divorce, dismiss
from the house in Matthew 19:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and if she herself divorces her husband and marries another
man, she is committing adultery.&quot;” (Mark 10:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew adjective for freedom <span lang=HE dir=RTL>חפשׁי</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(chophshı̂y) has the

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Hebrew word for liberty </u><u><span lang=HE
dir=RTL>דּרור</span></u><span dir=LTR></span><u><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>(derôr) has the following uses.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i><u>Derôr</u></i> is used of liberty of the year of
Jubilee in Isaiah 61:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me, Because the LORD has
anointed me To bring good news to the afflicted; He has sent me to bind up the
brokenhearted, To proclaim liberty to captives And freedom to prisoners;”
(Isaiah 61:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i><u>Derôr</u></i> is used of liberty of release in the
Sabbatical year in Jeremiah 34:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD after King
Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people who were in Jerusalem to
proclaim release to them:” (Jeremiah 34:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i><u>Derôr</u></i> is used of liberty to be destroyed
by sword, pestilence, and famine in Ezekiel 46:17. Liberty has a volitional
connotation here. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But if he gives a gift from his inheritance to one of
his servants, it shall be his until the year of liberty; then it shall return
to the prince. His inheritance shall be only his sons'; it shall belong to
them.” (Ezekiel 46:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Balancing the Four Laws of Christian Liberty  </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Law of Liberty must be balanced with the Law of Love.
Liberty is not to be used as an opportunity to satisfy your fleshly desires.
Gal. 5:13-15. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For you were called to freedom, brethren; only do not turn
your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one
another. For the whole Law is fulfilled in one word, in the statement,
&quot;YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.&quot; But if you bite and
devour one another, take care that you are not consumed by one another.”
(Galatians 5:13-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Galatians 5:13, “opportunity” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span
lang=EL>φορμη</span>́ (aphormē) and refers to a base of operation, a place
from which a movement or attack is made, that by which you are excited to do a
thing, that which gives occasion or incentive, the resources we have in
attempting to do a thing. Therefore, the idea of this word is a base of
operations, an exciting motivator, incentive or resources to do a thing.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Liberty is not to be used as a base of operation, the
motivator, the incentive, or the resource to do the thing you desire. “Love” is
ἀγαπάω (agapaō) and refers to the unconditional mental attitude love from
the filling of the Holy Spirit coupled with the <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine
in the soul that produces a capacity to love others regardless of how they
behave. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Law of Liberty must be balanced with Law of
Expediency. 1 Cor. 10:23-33. Liberty is not to be used when it is not expedient
to do so. In 1 Corinthians 10:23, “profitable” is <span lang=EL>συμφε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ρω</span> (sumpherō) and also means expedient. All things are lawful,
but not all things contribute in order to help.  All things are lawful, but not
all things build.</p>

<p class=Verses>“All things are lawful, but not all things are profitable. All
things are lawful, but not all things edify. Let no one seek his own good, but
that of his neighbor.” (1 Corinthians 10:23-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But if anyone says to you, &quot;This is meat sacrificed to
idols,&quot; do not eat it, for the sake of the one who informed you, and for
conscience' sake; I mean not your own conscience, but the other man's; for why
is my freedom judged by another's conscience?” (1 Corinthians 10:28-29, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to
the glory of God. Give no offense either to Jews or to Greeks or to the church
of God;” (1 Corinthians 10:31-32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Liberty is built on knowledge which by itself can puff up
and cause arrogance. Love is built on knowledge, which itself builds up and is
profitable. Love edifies. The knowledge of <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine is the
product of the filling of the Spirit and that which is a part of the spiritual
growth process. 1 Cor. 8:1, Gal. 5:15, Eph. 4:25-32.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now concerning things sacrificed to idols, we know that we all
have knowledge. Knowledge makes arrogant, but love edifies.” (1 Corinthians
8:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But if you bite and devour one another, take care that you are
not consumed by one another.” (Galatians 5:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, laying aside falsehood, SPEAK TRUTH EACH ONE of you
WITH HIS NEIGHBOR, for we are members of one another. BE ANGRY, AND yet DO NOT
SIN; do not let the sun go down on your anger,” (Ephesians 4:25-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth, but only such
a word as is good for edification according to the need of the moment, so that
it will give grace to those who hear.” (Ephesians 4:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Law of Liberty must be balanced with the Law of
Supreme Sacrifice. 1 Cor. 9:1-18, 1 Cor. 9:19-27.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do we not have a right to eat and drink? Do we not have a
right to take along a believing wife, even as the rest of the apostles and the
brothers of the Lord and Cephas?” (1 Corinthians 9:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we sowed spiritual things in you, is it too much if we reap
material things from you? If others share the right over you, do we not more?
Nevertheless, we did not use this right, but we endure all things so that we
will cause no hindrance to the gospel of Christ.” (1 Corinthians 9:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For if I do this voluntarily, I have a reward; but if against
my will, I have a stewardship entrusted to me. What then is my reward? That,
when I preach the gospel, I may offer the gospel without charge, so as not to
make full use of my right in the gospel.” (1 Corinthians 9:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For though I am free from all men, I have made myself a slave
to all, so that I may win more. To the Jews I became as a Jew, so that I might
win Jews; to those who are under the Law, as under the Law though not being
myself under the Law, so that I might win those who are under the Law;” (1
Corinthians 9:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“To the weak I became weak, that I might win the weak; I have
become all things to all men, so that I may by all means save some. I do all
things for the sake of the gospel, so that I may become a fellow partaker of
it.” (1 Corinthians 9:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Christian Liberty’s Self-imposed Restrictions </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The strong or spiritually mature believer is one who by
reason of knowledge of Bible doctrine and resultant spiritual growth understands
their own liberty and recognizes the legalism possible or at least lack of
liberty of a weaker believer. Strength and liberty are directly related to
truth. James 1:25.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But one who looks intently at the perfect law, the law of
liberty, and abides by it, not having become a forgetful hearer but an
effectual doer, this man will be blessed in what he does.&quot;  (James 1:25,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The mature believer will normally have some responses to
the weaker believer. They may want to establish a friendship with them to help them.
They may want to establish a friendship with them to straighten them out. They
may simply observe them as one who is stupid and deficient in doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They may develop a wrong mental attitude toward the
believer with norms and standards that seem to point accusing fingers at their
liberty. They may seek to impress the weaker believer by showing off in front
of them in the area where the weaker believer is sensitive. They may consider
the weaker believer to be out of fellowship and not make a distinction between
the concepts of carnality and the restrictions due to a lack of spiritual growth.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The strong believer is not to use their liberty, their spiritual
growth, or their knowledge of Bible doctrine to intimidate, belittle, annoy,
upset, criticize, torment or harass another believer regardless of how far off from
Bible doctrine they may be. The strong believer is responsible to help the
weaker believer in establishing a better understanding of the Word in areas of
question.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The weak believer will also normally have some responses
to the strong believer. Often the weak believer will consider the other
believer to be out of fellowship and not really the spiritually stronger at
all. This is a typical attitude of the spiritual babe or adolescent. The weaker
believer will make their own norms and standards the criteria for determining
the error of the stronger believer, rather than learning Bible doctrine in the
local church from the pastor-teacher. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The weaker believer very cleverly concludes that if this
person is a strong believer, then they should not do that thing that offends them.
The weaker believer fails to realize that the stronger believer lives their
life to God and not to them. They fail to respect the more developed norms and
standards of the other person.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In both cases the issue is for the stronger believer to
get his eyes off the weaker believer and onto the Lord and if necessary
restrict himself regarding the weaker believer. On the other hand, the weaker
believer needs to get his eyes off the strong believer and onto the Lord, with
the application result of respecting the norms and standards of the stronger
believer.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In each case, they must live their lives as unto the Lord
and not to men. Both the strong and weak believer must realize that they are no
better or worse in the sight of God for doing or not doing a certain thing.
Each gives their own account to the Lord. Col. 3:23-25.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Whatever you do, do your work heartily, as for the Lord
rather than for men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of
the inheritance. It is the Lord Christ whom you serve. For he who does wrong
will receive the consequences of the wrong which he has done, and that without
partiality.&quot;  (Colossians 3:23-25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The usual reason why you want someone to adhere to your
standards or practices or respect your liberties, is that you feel that God
does. The weak believer arrogantly feels that God is impressed with their great
self-discipline and sacrifice, so therefore why shouldn’t you be? The strong
believer thinks God is impressed with the marvelous spiritual growth they have
and therefore, why should not the other be impressed? Why should they be
curtailed in using the liberty that God has provided for them? </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Those believers who most often practice the judging of
others have themselves been duped into some false system of worship or
spirituality. Col. 2:16-23.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore no one is to act as your judge in regard to
food or drink or in respect to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath day—
things which are a mere shadow of what is to come; but the substance belongs to
Christ. Let no one keep defrauding you of your prize by delighting in
self-abasement and the worship of the angels, taking his stand on visions he
has seen, inflated without cause by his fleshly mind, and not holding fast to
the head, from whom the entire body, being supplied and held together by the joints
and ligaments, grows with a growth which is from God. If you have died with
Christ to the elementary principles of the world, why, as if you were living in
the world, do you submit yourself to decrees, such as, &quot;Do not handle, do
not taste, do not touch!&quot; (which all refer to things destined to perish
with use)—in accordance with the commandments and teachings of men? These are
matters which have, to be sure, the appearance of wisdom in self-made religion
and self-abasement and severe treatment of the body, but are of no value
against fleshly indulgence.&quot;  (Colossians 2:16-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Paul’s Application of the Law of Supreme Sacrifice</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In times of great pressure, for the benefit of the
ministry, it may be necessary for a person to choose to labor under the Law of
Supreme Sacrifice as did Paul in 1 Corinthians 9:1-18. Paul was free because of
his relationship with Christ. He was free in the exercise of his authority
because the Word of God was his work. He was free in the exercise of his
authority because of his spiritual gift of Apostleship. 1 Cor. 9:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our
Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord? If to others I am not an apostle, at
least I am to you; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.” (1
Corinthians 9:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul was free to eat meat and drink and to marry as did the
other apostles including Peter. 1 Cor. 9:4-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do we not have a right to eat and drink? Do we not have a
right to take along a believing wife, even as the rest of the apostles and the
brothers of the Lord and Cephas?” (1 Corinthians 9:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul was free to carry on the ministry without working. 1
Cor. 9:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Or do only Barnabas and I not have a right to refrain from
working?” (1 Corinthians 9:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul was free to benefit from the fruits of my labors. 1
Cor. 9:7-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Who at any time serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who
plants a vineyard and does not eat the fruit of it? Or who tends a flock and
does not use the milk of the flock?” (1 Corinthians 9:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we sowed spiritual things in you, is it too much if we reap
material things from you?” (1 Corinthians 9:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So also the Lord directed those who proclaim the gospel to get
their living from the gospel.” (1 Corinthians 9:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul was free to lay aside his freedom and operate under
personal sacrifice if it enhanced the ministry. 1 Cor. 9:16-18. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to boast of, for I
am under compulsion; for woe is me if I do not preach the gospel. For if I do
this voluntarily, I have a reward; but if against my will, I have a stewardship
entrusted to me. What then is my reward? That, when I preach the gospel, I may
offer the gospel without charge, so as not to make full use of my right in the
gospel.” (1 Corinthians 9:16-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul made himself a servant to all that he might win more
to the Lord Jesus Christ. 1 Cor. 9:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For though I am free from all men, I have made myself a slave
to all, so that I may win more.” (1 Corinthians 9:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In his ministry, he did not make the norm or standard of
the conscience of others an issue in ministering to them. He abstained from
violating their norms and standards in order to help them. The reason for this
was “for the Gospel’s sake.” 1 Cor. 9:20-22, 1 Cor. 9:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“To the Jews I became as a Jew, so that I might win Jews; to
those who are under the Law, as under the Law though not being myself under the
Law, so that I might win those who are under the Law; to those who are without
law, as without law, though not being without the law of God but under the law
of Christ, so that I might win those who are without law. To the weak I became
weak, that I might win the weak; I have become all things to all men, so that I
may by all means save some.” (1 Corinthians 9:20-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“I do all things for the sake of the gospel, so that I may
become a fellow partaker of it.” (1 Corinthians 9:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The desire for more fruit by the Apostle Paul has a
completion in the rewards which will come to him for his service. The
curtailment of his own liberties was therefore done in view of greater
blessings and rewards in the future. 1 Cor. 9:24-27.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but
only one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may win. Everyone who
competes in the games exercises self-control in all things. They then do it to
receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable. Therefore I run in such a
way, as not without aim; I box in such a way, as not beating the air; but I
discipline my body and make it my slave, so that, after I have preached to
others, I myself will not be disqualified.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 9:24-27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul likens the curtailment of his liberties in the
ministry to the discipline of the athlete in competition. The idea in context
is that of curtailing those liberties which would hinder the race. In long
races, you have more liberty than in short races. Two wrong strides in a short
race will cost you the race. In the mile run, you might be ahead or behind or
in the middle a half dozen times. It is long enough to make up for some of your
mistakes. Paul likens the ministry to a short race where one error can cost you
the race.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 Corinthians 9:25, “competes” is the present middle
participle of <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>γωνι</span>́<span lang=EL>ζομαι</span>
(agōnizomai) and means to strive to enter the contest, then compete in the
contest. First, he must qualify to enter, then he must be in good enough physical
condition to win. Here are two concepts. There is a curtailment of liberties in
order to prepare and enter the ministry race. Then there is the curtailment of
liberties in order to win the race, once begun.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This curtailment of liberty is called “exercising
self-control” or <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>γκρατευ</span>́<span
lang=EL>ομαι</span> (egkrateuomai). Certain liberties of the Greeks were set
aside to enter a race. They put themselves under strict supreme sacrifice. Some
of these curtailments were abstaining from unwholesome food, abstaining from
wine, and from sexual indulgence. Now, for a Greek, this was really supreme
sacrifice, considering this was most of their normal life</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul’s curtailment of his liberties was deliberate and
planned. They were not just passive omissions. In 1 Corinthians 9:26, “not
without aim” is <span lang=EL>ουκ</span><span lang=EL> </span><span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span
lang=EL>δη</span>́<span lang=EL>λως</span> (ouk adēlōs) and with the negative
indicates a clear objective. He wasn’t fumbling around with whether he should
or should not restrict himself. He knew full well that he had to do.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“I box” is <span lang=EL>πυκτε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(pukteō) and means to be a boxer, not as one that is just throwing punches out
in the air. He had a real purpose behind each one and that is the contact with
an opponent in some vital spot. This is given to underline the fact that he had
a definite purpose behind each action.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 9:27, “but I discipline my body and make
it my slave” means to discipline the body by hardships, handle it roughly with
rigid discipline so that it could take the strain of the contest. The purpose
for the practice of the law of supreme sacrifice is that Paul might not be “disqualified”
<span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>δο</span>́<span lang=EL>κιμος</span>
(adokimos) and refers to the Bema Seat or the Judgment Seat of Christ. </p>
