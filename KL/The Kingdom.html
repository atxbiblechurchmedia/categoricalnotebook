<h2>The Kingdom  </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The use of the word “Kingdom” in the Bible is primarily
dispensational, referring to the Millennium, the future 1,000 year reign of
Jesus Christ on earth. Rev. 20:1-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding the key
of the abyss and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold of the dragon, the
serpent of old, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years;
and he threw him into the abyss, and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he
would not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were
completed; after these things he must be released for a short time. Then I saw
thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them. And I saw the
souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony of Jesus and
because of the word of God, and those who had not worshiped the beast or his
image, and had not received the mark on their forehead and on their hand; and
they came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.”  (Revelation
20:1-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is the Kingdom referred to in the “Lord’s Prayer” in
Matthew 6:10 and is the Millennial kingdom.</p>

<p class=Verses>“‘Your kingdom come. Your will be done, On earth as it is in
heaven.”  (Matthew 6:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Davidic Covenant in 2 Samuel 7:8-16 promises the King
(the Messiah) a kingdom. This will be on earth with the King, the Lord Jesus
Christ personally present.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Now therefore, thus you shall say to My servant David, ‘Thus
says the LORD of hosts, “I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep,
to be ruler over My people Israel. “I have been with you wherever you have gone
and have cut off all your enemies from before you; and I will make you a great
name, like the names of the great men who are on the earth. “I will also
appoint a place for My people Israel and will plant them, that they may live in
their own place and not be disturbed again, nor will the wicked afflict them
any more as formerly, even from the day that I commanded judges to be over My
people Israel; and I will give you rest from all your enemies. The LORD also
declares to you that the LORD will make a house for you. “When your days are
complete and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your descendant
after you, who will come forth from you, and I will establish his kingdom. “He
shall build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom
forever. “I will be a father to him and he will be a son to Me; when he commits
iniquity, I will correct him with the rod of men and the strokes of the sons of
men, but My lovingkindness shall not depart from him, as I took it away from
Saul, whom I removed from before you. “Your house and your kingdom shall endure
before Me forever; your throne shall be established forever.”‘““  (2 Samuel
7:8-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Kingdom of God can refer to believers in God’s plan
who have been born again and therefore are in His Kingdom. There are many
passages in the Gospels. The Kingdom of God includes believers of all ages
(Gentile, Jew, Church, and Kingdom). However, the kingdom of heaven can
specifically refer to the kingdom of God on earth, the Millennium, as set forth
in the Book of Matthew – for example the Sermon on the Mount.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Kingdom cannot be brought in by prayer or by making
this world a better place in which to live. The Kingdom on earth (Millennium)
begins at the Second Advent of Jesus Christ. Since Jesus Christ is the King and
we are in Christ, we will reign with Him forever. 2 Tim. 2:10-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason I endure all things for the sake of those who
are chosen, so that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus
and with it eternal glory. It is a trustworthy statement: For if we died with
Him, we will also live with Him; If we endure, we will also reign with Him; If
we deny Him, He also will deny us; If we are faithless, He remains faithful,
for He cannot deny Himself.”  (2 Timothy 2:10-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 17:21, Jesus Christ is presenting Himself as the
King, but the unbelieving Pharisees would not buy it. The term “in your midst” is
<span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>ντο</span>́<span lang=EL>ς</span> (entos) in
the Greek and means the Kingdom of God is “within you.” <i>Entos</i> can also
refer to the indwelling deity of Jesus Christ as the Shekinah Glory in every Church
Age believer.</p>

<p class=Verses>“nor will they say, ‘Look, here it is!’ or, ‘There it is!’ For
behold, the kingdom of God is in your midst.”“  (Luke 17:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The King can never be separated from His Kingdom. During
the Millennium, He will be the Divine Dictator ruling with love and a rod of
iron to keep order, even to the point of capital punishment. As King, He is
Supreme, King of kings and Lord of lords. Rom. 8:31. </p>

<p class=Verses>“What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who
is against us?”  (Romans 8:31, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Kingdom Issues </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The character of God is absolute, perfect, and unchanging.
God keeps His word. He is coming back before the Millennium to reign and to
keep His Word. This demonstrates His absolute righteousness (+R) and His immutability.
God promised David that he would have a son who would reign forever. Jesus
Christ is that Son and He will reign forever. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s unconditional covenants to Israel will all be
fulfilled at the Second Advent of Christ. All four covenants have eternal life
clauses.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The continued dispersion of Israel under the Fifth Cycle
of Discipline that exists to this day does not abrogate the unconditional covenants
made by God. Egyptian bondage didn’t abrogate the covenants - the Exodus took
place. Babylon captivity didn’t abrogate the covenants. The 70 AD Fifth Cycle
of Discipline dispersion didn’t knock out the covenants. Israel is dispersed
today, but not lost. God knows where they are. There are no lost tribes of
Israel. Post-Millennialism and Amillennialism say that Israel will never be
Israel again, but the Church. This is a false interpretation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Does the nation Israel have a future? Yes, but only the
regenerate of Israel. In Romans 9:6, the phrases  “For they” and “descended
from Israel” both refer to racial Jews. The phrase “are not all Israel” refers
to regenerate Jews. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But it is not as though the word of God has failed. For they
are not all Israel who are descended from Israel;”  (Romans 9:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Regarding the Second Advent issue, Jesus Christ (Son of
David) will actually come back to earth physically as the glorified God-man. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Millennial Kingdom is declared to be eternal. At the
Second Advent, Jesus Christ returns to earth and establishes His Kingdom. He
takes the first 1,000 years to demonstrate to man that perfect environment does
not solve man’s problems. His Kingdom will go on forever. See category on <a
