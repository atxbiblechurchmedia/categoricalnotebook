<h2><a name="_Living_in_the"></a><a name="_D-Living_in_the"></a>Living in the
Word</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Living in the Word is the dependence upon and use of all
the Bible doctrine in the soul’s frame of reference in all circumstances of
normal human living. Living in the Word involves profitable and effective Bible
study. For the babe believer, this would center on the initial intake of the
facts of the Word, claiming God's promises using faith-rest and then applying
them to real situations in life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Living in the Word for the growing believer would center
on the consistent intake of categorical Bible doctrine, application of that accumulated
<i>epignosis</i> truth, and filling in the details on the structure of the soul’s
frame of reference. Living in the Word for the growing believer would also
involve expressing their spiritual gift whether they have identified it or not.
In the spiritual life, your spiritual gift will function. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Therefore, living in the Word for the mature believer
would relate to the use of the Word of God daily in their life in the context
of divine good production. They express the Word through their spiritual gift to
the maximum in their spiritual life. Tools for living in the Word are daily
Bible class and face to face teaching, applying the <i>epignosis</i> Bible
doctrine in the soul’s frame of reference to occasions of life, and personal
study of the Word.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is much emphasis on “all the counsel of God” in the
Word of God. In Psalms 119:11, “word” here refers to the whole panorama of God’s
Word, the whole counsel of it. It suggests approaching the Word of God in a
systematic, survey method.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Your word I have treasured in my heart, That I may not sin
against You.”  (Psalms 119:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Many believers know a truth here and a truth there, but
there is no concept of the entire structuring of the Word of God from cover to
cover. Acts 20:27 also furthers this thought.</p>

<p class=Verses>““For I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole purpose
of God.”  (Acts 20:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>First of all you need effective tools. A loose leaf
notebook or a laptop are good for orderly taking of notes. Also a good study
Bible is a must. Bible dictionaries and handbooks will be extremely helpful.
Electronic equipment to access or play Bible doctrine lessons from many sources
such as CDs, DVDs, USB drives, Internet streaming, eBooks, etc. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are probably hundreds of ways to survey “the whole
purpose of God.” The following are suggested methods of Bible study that should
be shared, but remember this is the fruit of verse by verse study from the
original languages of the Bible.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Survey Approach</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Survey Approach is a basic approach to Bible study
that is indicated by Acts 20:27, Psalms 119:11 and other passages. There must
be a thousand ways to survey-study the Bible. One way is to “think through” the
content of the Bible by chapter titles. This involves attaching a title to the
entire chapter of each book that captures the essence of the content therein. The
Book of Exodus and the Book of Revelation are listed below as examples.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For chapter titles for all of the 1189 chapters in the
Bible, see category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/B/The%20Bible%2C%20Suggested%20Chapter%20Titles.html">The Bible, Suggested
Chapter Titles For Learning Bible Content</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You can also survey the Word of God by the different
ages, by developing God's promises made to Abraham, by topics and so on.
Preaching and teaching in series is very important in building people up in the
faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Another survey method is tracing the term “promise” as
developed in the Abrahamic, Palestinian, Davidic, and New Covenants. Also one
can set a panorama by developing the different dispensations (Gentiles, Jews,
Church, and Kingdom). Being able to think through the Old and New Testament
historically is fascinating. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Most effective pastors teach the Word of God through an
entire book using the ICE Method (Isagogics, Categorical, and Exegesis) of
learning and teaching. Consequently, the Categorical Approach is the way to go.
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Categorical Approach</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Categorical Approach is taking the subject matter of
the Word (as found in the survey approach, or expositional study) and
exhausting them for their details. One category is Prayer, another Witnessing,
another Suffering, still another the Angelic Conflict. This approach comes
alive when the facts gleaned through study are applied to experience. This
entire Categorical Notebook is an illustration of the categorical method.
Isaiah 28:10; Isaiah 28:13. </p>

<p class=Verses>““For He says, ‘Order on order, order on order, Line on line,
line on line, A little here, a little there.’”“  (Isaiah 28:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So the word of the LORD to them will be, “Order on order,
order on order, Line on line, line on line, A little here, a little there,”
That they may go and stumble backward, be broken, snared and taken captive.” 
(Isaiah 28:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As the Word of God is taught verse by verse and word by
word from the standpoint of the original languages, the Word is categorized.
These categories of the Word are in turn transferred to the right lobe of the
soul by faith. Here, the Word can be systematically used to construct the
Edification Complex of the soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Meditation Approach</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Meditation Approach is the third main method of
intake of Bible doctrine. This enables you to carry the Word with you with your
mind being saturated with the Word of God. Not only is the whole counsel of the
Word brought to mind, but the fruits of those two methods are to be thought
about constantly. This is taking the fruits of survey and categorical study and
“thinking them through.” This is a lost art today. This technique is developed
next, thinking divine viewpoint. A verse that sums up this approach is Isaiah
26:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>““The steadfast of mind You will keep in perfect peace, Because
he trusts in You.”  (Isaiah 26:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We need to be students of the Word and stockpile Bible
doctrine, applying the fruit of our studies to our day by day routine. Other
suggestions for effective Bible study involve reading and rereading one Bible
book, reading the Old Testament through chronologically, memorizing verses,
passages, and books and using the principle of repetition until you overlearn
it. Let the Bible saturate your entire being.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Much time is lost by not thinking divine viewpoint of the
Word of God. Constantly saturate your mind with chapter title content,
categories, or Scriptural passages. Instead of memorizing, think through the
Word in different ways. Study, study, study - repeat, repeat, repeat. Get to
the point of maximum residual <i>epignosis</i> doctrine in your soul so that
the Word of God is at your fingertips. Do you ever have to review 1 John 1:9 or
John 3:16? Probably not. Well, get the entire content of the Word that well in hand.
The Word of God is alive and powerful. Heb. 4:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”  (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten
Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.” 
(John 3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any
two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of
both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the
heart.”  (Hebrews 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The answer to an effective outreach and inner stability
is not programs, activities, human hustle, and parties ad nauseum. It is sowing
the Word around the area of maximum penetration and positive volition.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Application of Bible Doctrine</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the soul with its
frame of reference sustains in every situation in the spiritual life. This is “living
in the Word.” Bible doctrine when properly taken in through the grace apparatus
for perception gives you an appreciation for the details of life. The right
lobe of the soul has areas for categories for Bible doctrine. Eph. 3:16-19. See
category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/S/The%20Right%20Lobe%20of%20the%20Soul.html">The Right Lobe of the Soul</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory,
to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inner man, so that
Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; and that you, being rooted and
grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the
breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ which
surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God.” 
(Ephesians 3:16-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In studying a passage of Scripture that you may not
understand, you identify what you do know and then work from the known to the
unknown. After some study (more than likely daily attendance at Bible class),
you begin to understand the unknown because you have information stored in the
soul and you are also developing a frame of reference.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The more Bible doctrine you learn and believe, the more
you apply this doctrine (<i>epignosis</i> in the right lobe of the soul with a
frame of reference and applied) the greater becomes your orientation to every
situation in life the greater becomes your inner happiness.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When many different categories of doctrine are known and
sent into the self-consciousness, the result is that you avoid self-pity and
pride. You have no illusions about yourself and have a relaxed mental attitude
without mental attitude sins. When situations or activities become
discouraging, you maintain your status quo of spirituality through knowledge of
Bible doctrine and the use of confession of sin per 1 John 1:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When you have Bible doctrine in the soul with the filling
of the Holy Spirit, your relationship with people is excellent because you have
a relaxed mental attitude. Bible doctrine plus the filling of the Holy Spirit
gives you the ability to make decisions based on discernment. All good
decisions require thinking.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You learn to appreciate things on the basis of Bible
doctrine. You can now enjoy your emotions, not depend upon them. You have
learned to appreciate things on the basis of the Word and your life as unto the
Lord is occupied with Christ. Your norms and standards become His. Your old sin
nature is frustrated and stimulation which comes from the lust pattern is
recognized and dealt with. Hence, the Christian way of life is on the inside.
Prov. 23:7</p>

<p class=Verses>“For as he thinks within himself, so he is. He says to you, “Eat
and drink!” But his heart is not with you.”  (Proverbs 23:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In summary, the babe believer’s main growth is seen in
the continuity of fellowship. The growing believer’s main spiritual growth is
seen in the development of capacities. The mature believer’s main growth is
seen in stability of divine good production. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All believers, whether babe, growing or mature, must
continue in the technique of living in the Word though it may have different
emphasis and expressions. 1 Tim. 4:15-16; 2 Tim. 2:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Take pains with these things; be absorbed in them, so
that your progress will be evident to all. Pay close attention to yourself and
to your teaching; persevere in these things, for as you do this you will ensure
salvation both for yourself and for those who hear you.&quot;  (1 Timothy
4:15-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a
workman who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of
truth.&quot;  (2 Timothy 2:15, NASB)</p>
