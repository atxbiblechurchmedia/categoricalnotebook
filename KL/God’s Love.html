<h2>God’s Love</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is infinite. Therefore, all members of the Trinity
are without limitation in their perfect absolute attributes. Each member of the
Trinity is coequal, coeternal, co-infinite in their attributes that includes
divine love.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God loved every member of the human race unconditionally
in eternity past before He ever created us. There never was a time when He did
not know everything about us and He still loved us with an infinite and perfect
love.  He knew all of the sins we would commit and loved us unconditionally
anyway. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To deal with sin, God in His infinite love gave the
greatest gift possible – His Son, Jesus Christ who would come to this earth,
take on the form of a man and go to the Cross and pay the judgment price for
all our sins. John 3:16; Rom. 5:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For God so loved the world, that He gave His only
begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal
life.” (John 3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we
were yet sinners, Christ died for us.” (Romans 5:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Therefore, salvation was provided as an option for every
member of the human race. Every member of the human race has equal opportunity
to believe in Christ. All things do work together for good for only those who
love God. Rom 8:28; Titus 3:4-7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And we know that God causes all things to work together for
good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.”
(Romans 8:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But when the kindness of God our Savior and His love for
mankind appeared, He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done in
righteousness, but according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration and
renewing by the Holy Spirit, whom He poured out upon us richly through Jesus
Christ our Savior, so that being justified by His grace we would be made heirs
according to the hope of eternal life.” (Titus 3:4-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To love God means you are fulfilling His plan for your
life. To fulfill His plan, you must learn what God's plan is through consistent
intake and application of Bible doctrine – the Word of God. When you grow
spiritually, you learn what God has done, what He does daily, and what He will
do in eternity. You develop a personal love for God and His grace provision. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God’s Love Related to His Other Attributes</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God's love is part of His essence or attributes.
Therefore, the love of God must be compatible with all the other divine
attributes. All three members of the Trinity have coequal and coeternal
attributes. They are; Sovereignty, Righteousness, Justice, Eternal Life, Love,
Omniscience, Omnipotence, Omnipresence, Immutability, and Veracity.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The love of God has always existed.  There never was a
time when it did not exist. 2 Thess. 3:5; Jude 1:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“May the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into
the steadfastness of Christ.” (2 Thessalonians 3:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting anxiously for the
mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to eternal life.” (Jude 1:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is very difficult for finite mankind to really begin
to understand God's infinite unchanging love for us. No matter how much human
beings change their behavior, God remains consistent with His own perfect and
immutable character. When we reject God’s eternal love, His love for us does
not change. Because God is perfect and absolute, His divine love cannot be
prejudiced, unfair, or in any way discriminatory.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is perfect absolute sovereignty. Therefore, His love
is perfect self-motivation. God’s love motivates His sovereignty. God's love is
compatible with all of His decisions. God never makes a decision apart from
love.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is perfect righteousness. Therefore, God's love
cannot be compromised by sins, human good, or evil. God's love cannot be
corrupted by any failures of His creatures. His love is totally devoid of sin.
It is totally devoid of any human good, altruism, or any source of evil
reaction. God's perfect righteousness means God’s love is totally moral and is
always absolutely fair.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is perfect justice. Since God is eternal, He is
eternally perfect in His justice. Therefore, since God cannot be anything less
than perfectly fair in all that He does, the function of His love is always
fair. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is eternal life. Therefore, God’s love has always
existed from eternity past. God does have to sustain His love. God's love does
not increase or decrease. God has always been perfect absolute love.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is omniscient. He has known all the knowable since
eternity past. God knew billions of years ago about every one of our sins and
failures, but His love always existed for us. God’s perfect absolute love never
changes, regardless of what we do or have done. God's love is not based on
emotions nor does He function in an emotional manner – ever. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is omnipotent. Therefore, God has infinite energy and
power with which to love.  God’s love exists eternally and unsustained by
Himself or by any other source.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is perfect absolute truth and veracity. In God's
veracity, it is impossible for Him to lie. God can only reveal Himself in terms
of absolute truth. Bible doctrine is absolute truth. God's love is rooted in
every doctrine and in every form of knowledge which resides in God’s absolute
being.  Divine love is never involved in any form of hatred. Divine love never
reacts. There is no reference to divine love apart from what is taught in the
Word of God. Therefore, God's love is revealed in every category of Bible
doctrine, the very thinking of Christ. 1 Cor 2:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT
HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.” (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The love of God cannot tempt, cannot solicit to sin,
cannot sponsor evil or human good or any form of self-righteousness. God’s love
cannot be complicated with ignorance or absurdities, such as relating emotion
to the spiritual life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is immutable. His love cannot ever change. God's love
is unchangeable, stable, compatible with His perfect character, and cannot be
corrupted by anything. God’s love cannot increase or decrease. God’s love
cannot expand or diminish. God’s love cannot begin or end. God’s love cannot be
change because of any human failure, moral or immoral.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s perfect righteousness and immutability indicates
that divine love is eternally consistent and revealed in the content of the
Scriptures. Doctrinal principles of the Canon of Scripture are beneficial to
the believer without compromising the essence of God. The greatest example of
this is the salvation work of Jesus Christ on the Cross.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s love has always been perfect and eternal in its
capacity. The capacity of God’s love is infinite and eternal. In human love,
man’s capacity for love is constantly changing. God's love never changes,
regardless of the circumstances.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Even when the justice of God is administering divine
discipline toward any believer, it is always accomplished in love. When mankind
punishes, it is often not done in love and certainly never done in perfect
divine love. Mankind’s punishment of others is often destructive. People are
almost never fair to other people, even when they think they are being fair.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s perfect love for His creatures existed even before
He created them. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s infinite and eternal love does not conform to human
standards. God's love is unchangeable. God’s love exists with or without us. 
God has always has from eternity past, a perfect unconditional love for sinful
mankind. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s love is not sustained by attraction, rapport, or
any category of human merit, works, or worthiness. Neither human good,
morality, self-righteousness, nor any system of human merit is the basis for
God extending His love to mankind. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s love has none of the unstable characteristics found
in human love. God’s love does not get hurt and is not hypersensitive like
human love can be. Because mankind is often subjective, human love is instable
and often hypersensitive. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You cannot begin to understand God’s love by
understanding people. The believer must never attempt to superimpose on the
character of God their own personal views and values. This is commonly done by
the human race without Bible doctrine in their souls. They need to be born
again in Jesus Christ as their Savior before they can receive the spiritual
resources to enable them to understand spiritual things – the things of God, Bible
doctrine. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God's Love For His Own Absolute Righteousness</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first category of God's love is called divine
self-esteem and is directed toward His own righteousness. God the Father loves
His own righteousness, God the Son loves His own righteousness, and God the
Holy Spirit loves His own righteousness. Both God's personal love and His
divine self‑esteem are always directed toward perfect righteousness.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has love for the other members of the Trinity. This
is God’s love for God. Each person of the Trinity has love directed toward His
own perfect righteousness and each person of the Trinity has perfect love
directed toward the perfect righteousness of the other two members of the
Trinity. From God’s divine self-esteem comes His unconditional love for His
creatures.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God’s Unconditional Love</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The second category of God's love is called unconditional
love toward God’s creatures.  Unconditional love is defined as love based on
the integrity of the one expressing the love toward another. In this case,
God’s absolute and perfect justice and righteousness are the basis for His love
toward His creatures. God’s creatures do not have perfect justice and righteousness,
yet God expresses unfailing unconditional love toward each and every one of His
creatures. God's unconditional love is expressed in John 3:16 and Romans 5:8.
These verses express God’s absolute unconditional love toward all of mankind
who are born with a sin nature and spiritually dead. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For God so loved the world, that He gave His only
begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal
life.” (John 3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we
were yet sinners, Christ died for us.” (Romans 5:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has unconditional love toward unsaved, spiritually
dead mankind. Being spiritually dead, man’s righteousness is relative and not
compatible with God’s perfect righteousness. For the believer in Christ, God
the Father has imputed His perfect righteousness to that person at salvation.
Therefore, God can personally love all believers who are imperfect without
compromising His perfect essence. This is because all believers possess God's
very own absolute righteousness. That perfect righteousness is the object of
God's love for the believer. God’s unconditional love always depends on who and
what God is, never on who and what mankind is. God’s love eternally existed and
is unchangeable. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divine unconditional love places all merit on the subject,
the one expressing that love. God is the One expressing the unconditional love,
so He can love spiritually dead mankind solely on the basis of His own perfect
character. The object of unconditional love can be attractive or unattractive,
worthy or unworthy.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Expression of God's Unconditional Love</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God's unconditional love is expressed in His plan for
salvation through the work of Jesus Christ on the Cross. Eph. 3:11; Eph. 2:8-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“This was in accordance with the eternal purpose which He
carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord,” (Ephesians 3:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not
of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one
may boast.” (Ephesians 2:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God's unconditional love is expressed in sending His Son
into the world to the Cross. 1 John 4:9-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“By this the love of God was manifested in us, that God has
sent His only begotten Son into the world so that we might live through Him. In
this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to
be the propitiation for our sins.” (1 John 4:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God's unconditional love is expressed by giving His Son and
by not sparing Him while judging Him on the Cross. The only thing that can
satisfy God’s justice regarding our sins is the fact that each one was judged
in Jesus Christ on the Cross. Therefore, no human works can ever be substituted
for the work of Jesus Christ on the Cross. John 3:16; Rom. 8:32.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For God so loved the world, that He gave His only
begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal
life.” (John 3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him over for
us all, how will He not also with Him freely give us all things?” (Romans 8:32,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God's unconditional love is expressed when mankind was
dead in sin. Eph. 2:4-5; Rom. 5:8-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with
which He loved us, even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive
together with Christ (by grace you have been saved),” (Ephesians 2:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we
were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, having now been justified
by His blood, we shall be saved from the wrath of God through Him. For if while
we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much
more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life. And not only this,
but we also exult in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have
now received the reconciliation.” (Romans 5:8-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Jesus Christ’s Unconditional Love for Mankind</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord Jesus Christ’s unconditional love for mankind
was expressed by His motivation to go to the Cross. Our Lord’s motivation was
based on His perfect personal love for God the Father.  He obeyed the Father’s
will by going to the Cross and receiving the judgment for our sins. He did not
feel threatened in His humanity because He had impersonal love toward all who
mistreated, maligned, hated, and despised Him, and toward all of us for whom He
was judged. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>God the Father’s Reaction to the Son’s Love for
Mankind</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Father’s reaction to the Son’s love for mankind
can be found in Matthew 17:5, Mark 9:7, Luke 9:35, and 2 Peter 1:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“While he was still speaking, a bright cloud overshadowed them,
and behold, a voice out of the cloud said, &quot;This is My beloved Son, with
whom I am well-pleased; listen to Him!&quot;” (Matthew 17:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then a cloud formed, overshadowing them, and a voice came out
of the cloud, &quot;This is My beloved Son, listen to Him!&quot;” (Mark 9:7,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then a voice came out of the cloud, saying, &quot;This is My
Son, My Chosen One; listen to Him!&quot;” (Luke 9:35, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For when He received honor and glory from God the Father, such
an utterance as this was made to Him by the Majestic Glory, &quot;This is My
beloved Son with whom I am well-pleased&quot;—” (2 Peter 1:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Since we are born spiritually dead and totally helpless
to have a relationship with God, there is no way God could love us because we
are attractive to Him. Furthermore, there is nothing we can ever do that would
make us attractive. Therefore, God's unconditional love is always directed
toward the world of unbelievers.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Believer’s Expression of Unconditional Love</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s unconditional love depends on who and what God is,
never on who and what mankind is.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divine unconditional love is the pattern for the
unconditional love of the believer that can be used to deal with all
interaction problems among people.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has mandated that all believers love other believers
and to love mankind in general. This is impossible to accomplish with personal
love, so this must be unconditional love based on the filling of the Holy
Spirit and application of Bible doctrine in our soul. It is God's power that
enables this unconditional love toward people that may be obnoxious, treating
you unfairly, repulsive in behavior or appearance, or those that are
persecuting you.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every believer has the capability of loving others
unconditionally because God first loved us and provided everything for us. 1
John 4:19; 1 John 4:11; 1 John 4:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“We love, because He first loved us.” (1 John 4:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one
another.” (1 John 4:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“We have come to know and have believed the love which God has
for us. God is love, and the one who abides in love abides in God, and God
abides in him.” (1 John 4:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When you mature spiritually, you gain in your
unconditional love toward others. They can be obnoxious, they can be evil, they
can be fantastic believers, or they can be intimate friends. How they behave
toward you matters not. The <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in your soul
expressed toward them is what matters. In this manner, you begin to emulate the
Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God’s Personal Love</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The third category of God’s love is His personal love.
Personal love is defined as love based on the attractive attributes possesses
by the object. Because God is perfect, God's personal love can only find
attractive equally perfect righteousness. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>God's Personal Love for Other Members of the Trinity</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s personal love is directed toward the perfect
righteousness of the other members of the Trinity. All three members of the
Trinity are co-equal and co-eternal and have exactly the same attributes and
are equally perfect in every way. Each person of the Trinity possesses perfect
personal love. Each person of the Trinity directs His personal love toward the
other persons in the Godhead who possess co-equal and co-eternal righteousness.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Remember that the three members of the Trinity each have
identical essence, including the same divine righteousness, justice, and love.
God is perfect, and therefore, His personal love can only be directed toward
the perfect righteousness in the other members of the Trinity. The object of
God's infinite, eternal, unchangeable personal love must always be absolute
divine righteousness.  God's personal love cannot be directed toward anything
less than perfect eternal righteousness.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Father loves the divine righteousness of God the
Son and the divine righteousness of God the Holy Spirit. Personal love from a
member of the Trinity demands that the object of that love be perfect. John
3:35; John 5:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;The Father loves the Son and has given all things into
His hand.” (John 3:35, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For the Father loves the Son, and shows Him all things
that He Himself is doing; and the Father will show Him greater works than
these, so that you will marvel.” (John 5:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>God's Personal Love for the Believer</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When we believe in Christ, God the Father imputes to us
His very own perfect absolute righteousness. This means that all three members
of the Trinity can personally love all who believe in Christ because they have
received the imputation of God's absolute righteousness.  God found a way in
grace to love us personally by giving us His own divine righteousness. Eph.
1:5; Eph. 2:4; Eph. 2:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to
Himself, according to the kind intention of His will,” (Ephesians 1:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with
which He loved us,” (Ephesians 2:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“so that in the ages to come He might show the surpassing
riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.” (Ephesians 2:7,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s personal love never contradicts His justice and
righteousness and is inseparably united with and compatible with His
righteousness and justice. The believer’s permanent possession of God's very
own absolute righteousness means they are justified at the moment of salvation
by faith in Christ, they are the object of God’s personal love, and they are
the recipient of God's grace resources necessary to live the spiritual life. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God's personal love is always the source of God’s grace
provision and blessings toward believers. This means that human works,
worthiness, merit, or good is not the basis of God’s love for us. No matter
what happens to the believer in time, there is no greater security than the
personal love of God for each and every believer, whether the believer is
spiritual or carnal. The personal love of God guarantees an eternal
relationship with God forever, even to the most sinful and carnal believers.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God's Discipline of the Believer</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God's righteousness demands that His justice punish the
carnal believer through personal love and grace. God's discipline of the
believer is a family matter. All Church Age believers are “sons of God” through
faith in Christ Jesus. We are in the family of God. Gal. 3:26-27.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. For
all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.”
(Galatians 3:26-27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Church Age, believers are either in a state of
spirituality and filled with the Holy Spirit or they are carnal and their soul
is controlled by the old sin nature. Both spirituality and carnality are
absolute. You are either 100% spiritual or 100% carnal. There is no such thing
as partial spirituality. Heb. 12:5-8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and you have forgotten the exhortation which is addressed to
you as sons, &quot;MY SON, DO NOT REGARD LIGHTLY THE DISCIPLINE OF THE LORD,
NOR FAINT WHEN YOU ARE REPROVED BY HIM; FOR THOSE WHOM THE LORD LOVES HE
DISCIPLINES, AND HE SCOURGES EVERY SON WHOM HE RECEIVES.&quot; It is for
discipline that you endure; God deals with you as with sons; for what son is
there whom his father does not discipline? But if you are without discipline,
of which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate children and not
sons.” (Hebrews 12:5-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divine discipline comes to all carnal believers from
God's love because God wants you to confess your sins and thereby return to
fellowship with Him just as a human father would discipline his son or daughter
in love so they will correct their behavior. Heb. 12:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to
them, but He disciplines us for our good, so that we may share His holiness.”
(Hebrews 12:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 12:10, “holiness” refers to the believer
responding to God's correction in personal love so that we may continue in our
spiritual growth. In doing so, God can bless the believer resulting in sharing
God's happiness.  </p>
