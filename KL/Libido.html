<h2><a name="_D-Libido"></a><a name="_Libido"></a>Libido</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Libido is the sexual urge and it is not a constant
factor. It comes in waves. The first wave of libido usually hits someone in
their middle teens (age 15-16). This is when some people get married, however
judgment is at an all-time low in a wave of libido.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Too often, selection of a lifetime partner is made on the
basis of pure animal instinct or exterior appearance. Generally speaking, a
person in their teens is not prepared for marriage. A boy in his teens does not
have the maturity to take the initiative in making the marriage work. He is 51%
responsible for the marriage. A girl in her teens is also not mature enough to
marry. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When the first wave of libido occurs, it is one of the
most difficult and serious times for young people. God has provided for
believers through the control of the Holy Spirit, the means by which one can
ride out this wave of libido, for it does subside. 1 Cor. 7:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But if they do not have self-control, let them marry; for it
is better to marry than to burn with passion.” (1 Corinthians 7:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The second wave of libido usually comes toward the end of
the teens (age 18-19). This is still a very dangerous period for marriage and
it is still a period of immaturity. Rom. 13:13-14; 1 Thess. 4:3-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Let us behave properly as in the day, not in carousing and
drunkenness, not in sexual promiscuity and sensuality, not in strife and
jealousy. But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh
in regard to its lusts.” (Romans 13:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this is the will of God, your sanctification; that is,
that you abstain from sexual immorality; that each of you know how to possess
his own vessel in sanctification and honor, not in lustful passion, like the
Gentiles who do not know God;” (1 Thessalonians 4:3-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If the man is mature and the woman immature, it can
sometimes work. But with two immature people, the marriage is doomed. If the
two have had daily exposure to Bible doctrine, have edification complexes well
on their way to completion, then there is hope.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Generally, if your spiritual life is right, your judgment
will become better after the third wave hits - age 19-20 in a woman and 21-22
in a man. Even then this is very young. Perhaps an ideal time for a person to
marry is 25 for the man after the man has had his hitch in military service and
a year or two younger for the woman.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Then there is the older man (sugar daddy) who has
outlived his first wife and then selects some sweet young thing who is not as
interested in his charms as in the thickness of his wallet. This type of
marriage usually has little or no divine viewpoint involved.</p>
