<h2>Loneliness</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Loneliness is a mental attitude induced by isolation from
persons, places, or things whether real, promised, or imagined. Loneliness can
be present in the believer in fellowship or out of fellowship and in the
unbeliever. A certain allotment of time to every individual involves being
alone. Jesus Christ was on the Mount of Olives and left His disciples a short
distance to pray alone. This was just before He was betrayed by Judas and
arrested. Luke 22:39-46. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And He withdrew from them about a stone's throw, and He knelt
down and began to pray, saying, &quot;Father, if You are willing, remove this
cup from Me; yet not My will, but Yours be done.&quot;” (Luke 22:41-42, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When the believer is out of fellowship, loneliness breeds
self-pity, depression, and paranoid mental aberrations. Job 2:10; Job 3:1; Job
3:11; Job 3:25-26. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But he said to her, &quot;You speak as one of the foolish
women speaks. Shall we indeed accept good from God and not accept
adversity?&quot; In all this Job did not sin with his lips.” (Job 2:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Afterward Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his
birth.” (Job 3:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Why did I not die at birth, Come forth from the womb and
expire?” (Job 3:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For what I fear comes upon me, And what I dread befalls
me. &quot;I am not at ease, nor am I quiet, And I am not at rest, but turmoil
comes.&quot;” (Job 3:25-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When the believer is in fellowship, loneliness draws on good
memories (fragrance of memories) and hope as a great sustainer. Song of Solomon
3:1. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;On my bed night after night I sought him Whom my soul
loves; I sought him but did not find him.” (Song of Solomon 3:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord’s disciples deserted Him when He was arrested. Mark
14:50. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And they all left Him and fled.” (Mark 14:50, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ atoned for the sins of mankind alone on the Cross.
Mark 15:34.</p>

<p class=Verses>“At the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice,
&quot;ELOI, ELOI, LAMA SABACHTHANI?&quot; which is translated, &quot;MY GOD, MY
GOD, WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME?&quot;” (Mark 15:34, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul was alone in the second imprisonment because Demas
and all others had forsaken him. 2 Tim. 4:10; 2 Tim. 4:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“for Demas, having loved this present world, has deserted me
and gone to Thessalonica; Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.” (2
Timothy 4:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“At my first defense no one supported me, but all deserted me;
may it not be counted against them.” (2 Timothy 4:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When you are lonely, your thoughts always turn to that
which is dearest to you, the dream world that eludes you or the world that
might have been, and to yourself. Loneliness can be a time of no details, no
noise, no people, no distraction and therefore a good time to think divine
viewpoint, but not to overthink!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The vocabulary word “loneliness” is not used in
Scripture, rather the term “forsake” which comes close with the resultant
mental attitude. In 1 Kings 8:57, “forsake” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>נטשׁ</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(nâṭash) and means to leave, to forsake, to abandon, to
cast away.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;May the LORD our God be with us, as He was with our
fathers; may He not leave us or forsake us,” (1 Kings 8:57, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 13:5, “forsake” is <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span
lang=EL>γκαταλει</span>́<span lang=EL>πω</span> (egkataleipō) and means to
abandon, to desert, to leave in straits, leave helpless, utterly forsaken.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Make sure that your character is free from the love of money,
being content with what you have; for He Himself has said, &quot;I WILL NEVER
DESERT YOU, NOR WILL I EVER FORSAKE YOU,&quot;” (Hebrews 13:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A single person’s loneliness will not be solved by
marriage, parties, travel, or people. Neither will crowds dispel loneliness. A
single individual and a married individual will both have the same amount of
loneliness.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In an apostate society, a woman may be lonely and
vulnerable to the reversionist. The greatest loneliness a wife will ever know
is when her husband rejects her. Isaiah 54:6-7. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For the LORD has called you, Like a wife forsaken and
grieved in spirit, Even like a wife of one's youth when she is rejected,&quot;
Says your God. &quot;For a brief moment I forsook you, But with great
compassion I will gather you.” (Isaiah 54:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A single woman can look forward to marrying the right kind
of man. A married woman who is a believer whose husband has rejected her has
nothing but Bible doctrine to look forward to. This is quite a test. Prov. 4:6.
</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Do not forsake her, and she will guard you; Love her,
and she will watch over you.” (Proverbs 4:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The only true solution to loneliness is the consistent
intake and application of Bible doctrine. Through spiritual growth, the
believer’s thinking becomes renewed by the Holy Spirit and they become able to
handle the loneliness because Jesus Christ is always with you and will never
forsake you. Heb. 13:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Make sure that your character is free from the love of money,
being content with what you have; for He Himself has said, &quot;I WILL NEVER
DESERT YOU, NOR WILL I EVER FORSAKE YOU,&quot;” (Hebrews 13:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The growing believer will learn to apply <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine to life’s situations and relationships. Loneliness becomes
replaced with meaningful love relationships. First, there is the appreciation
for what God has done in His grace that results in a personal love for God.
This is a friendship or <i>phileo</i> love. John 15:15. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;No longer do I call you slaves, for the slave does not
know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all things
that I have heard from My Father I have made known to you.” (John 15:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In marriage, there is the friendship love between husband
and wife. Song of Solomon; Proverbs 31. Then there is a love relationship with close
friends. For example, David and Jonathan in 1 Samuel 18:1-3 and 2 Samuel 1:26.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now it came about when he had finished speaking to Saul, that
the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as
himself. Saul took him that day and did not let him return to his father's
house. Then Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as
himself.” (1 Samuel 18:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan; You have
been very pleasant to me. Your love to me was more wonderful Than the love of
women.” (2 Samuel 1:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The ultimate solution to loneliness is the maturing believer
utilizing their spiritual gift(s) in their spiritual life. Psalm 37:25 refers
to prosperity of the time under the reign of David.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I have been young and now I am old, Yet I have not seen the
righteous forsaken Or his descendants begging bread.” (Psalms 37:25, NASB)</p>
