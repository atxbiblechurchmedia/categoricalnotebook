<h2>Legislation</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All legislation of a nation under the Divine Institution
#4 – Nationalism/Government is pertinent to the protection of the people of
that nation. Such laws should be designed to protect, not enslave. Legislation
which proceeds out of government actually protects the other three Divine
Institutions of volition, marriage, and family. All socialistic legislation is
an attack against freedom.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Legislation cannot make people equal. People are not born
equal and legislation cannot make them equal. Legislation cannot remove
poverty. Legislation cannot stop war. Legislation cannot bring world peace.
Legislation has never solved the evils of the world and was never designed to
solve the evils of the world. Legislation is designed to protect the people in
a national entity. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We have been so bitten by the mad dog of Socialism that
legislation today is trying to make all people equal or give them equal
opportunity. You can’t legislate equal opportunity for minority or majority
races. Salvation and the Christian way of life is the only equalizer and that
equalizer is bona fide.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Legislation is designed by God to protect the rights, the
privacy, the property, and the volition of individuals within a national
entity. Legislation should be designed to allow freedom of choice in matters of
religion, social, or business activity and should never coerce the individuals
in these matters. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The federal government does not have the right to tell
you that you cannot believe in Jesus Christ, nor does it have the right to keep
you from worshipping in the church of your choice. Also, the government does
not have the right to penalize you if you are an atheist. This is not the
business of the federal government.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The federal government does not have the right to dictate
who to hire or fire in business. The federal government does not have the right
to pick your friends and associates. These are matters of personal choice and
personal freedom.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The law of the Medes and Persians forbade Daniel to pray,
but God’s law (the Mosaic Law) commanded Daniel to pray, therefore Daniel did
the right and patriotic thing by prayer. Dan. 6:10-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now when Daniel knew that the document was signed, he entered
his house (now in his roof chamber he had windows open toward Jerusalem); and
he continued kneeling on his knees three times a day, praying and giving thanks
before his God, as he had been doing previously. Then these men came by
agreement and found Daniel making petition and supplication before his God.
Then they approached and spoke before the king about the king’s injunction, “Did
you not sign an injunction that any man who makes a petition to any god or man
besides you, O king, for thirty days, is to be cast into the lions’ den?” The
king replied, “The statement is true, according to the law of the Medes and
Persians, which may not be revoked.” Then they answered and spoke before the
king, “Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, pays no attention to you, O
king, or to the injunction which you signed, but keeps making his petition
three times a day.”“  (Daniel 6:10-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Daniel was actually operating under a higher law and
actually was doing more for the Persian empire by praying. It is God who
sustained the Persian Empire. Hence, by violating this ludicrous legislation,
Daniel was faithful to the Lord and a patriot to the Persian Empire. Patriotism
is the heritage of regeneration. Born-again believers in fellowship are the
salt of the earth. Isaiah 45.</p>
