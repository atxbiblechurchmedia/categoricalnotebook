<h2>The Last Judgment</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The purpose of the Last Judgment or the Great White
Throne Judgment will be to give the unbeliever an opportunity to present their
defense before God before He carries out His sentence based on His perfect
justice and absolute righteousness. This judgment is not separation of
believers from unbelievers as only unbelievers will be judged. The unpardonable
sin of rejection of Jesus Christ atoning work on the Cross will be the only
reason the unbeliever will be at the Last Judgment. John 3:36. In Matthew 12:31
and Mark 3:28-29, the unpardonable sin of rejection of the work of Jesus Christ
is called “blasphemy against the Holy Spirit.”</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who
does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on
him.&quot;” (John 3:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Therefore I say to you, any sin and blasphemy shall be
forgiven people, but blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven.”
(Matthew 12:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Truly I say to you, all sins shall be forgiven the sons
of men, and whatever blasphemies they utter; but whoever blasphemes against the
Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin&quot;—”
(Mark 3:28-29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The unbeliever, by rejection of Jesus Christ, stands on
their own good works as their defense instead of accepting the work of Christ
on the Cross. Jesus Christ was judged for the sins of the whole world. 1 Cor.
3:18-20; 1 John 2:2. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you thinks that
he is wise in this age, he must become foolish, so that he may become wise. For
the wisdom of this world is foolishness before God. For it is written, &quot;He
is THE ONE WHO CATCHES THE WISE IN THEIR CRAFTINESS&quot;; and again, &quot;THE
LORD KNOWS THE REASONINGS of the wise, THAT THEY ARE USELESS.&quot;” (1
Corinthians 3:18-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins; and not for
ours only, but also for those of the whole world.” (1 John 2:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Consequently, no one is ever judged for their sins at the
Great White Throne Judgment. Sins will not be mentioned at the Last Judgment
because Jesus Christ was already judged for all of them on the Cross. This is
the law of double jeopardy where you cannot be judged twice for the same
offense.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Therefore, God in His justice, will evaluate the
unbelievers’ good works. They will never measure up no matter how good they
have been in their life on earth. The best they could ever do are nothing more
than relative righteousness. The unbeliever’s relative righteousness cannot
ever have fellowship with God’s perfect absolute righteousness. Isaiah 64:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For all of us have become like one who is unclean, And all our
righteous deeds are like a filthy garment; And all of us wither like a leaf,
And our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.” (Isaiah 64:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Revelation 20:11, “Him who sat upon it” is none other
than the Lord Jesus Christ. He was judged for the sins of the whole world and
now He will judge all who have rejected that work. God the Father has committed
all judgment to the Son. John 5:22; John 5:27.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat upon it, from
whose presence earth and heaven fled away, and no place was found for them.”
(Revelation 20:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For not even the Father judges anyone, but He has given
all judgment to the Son,” (John 5:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses> “and He gave Him authority to execute judgment, because He is
the Son of Man.” (John 5:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Revelation 20:12, “the dead” refers to the spiritually
dead. Not born again. “Standing before the throne” are all unbelievers
resurrected unto judgment and eternal damnation. “The books” refers to the Book
of Works and to the Book of Life. Unbelievers’ names are blotted out from the
Book of Life at the point of their physical death. The Books of Works contain
all the human good ever produced by unbelievers from all of human history. See
category on the <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/B/Book%20of%20Life%20and%20Book%20of%20Works.html">Book of Life and Book of Works</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before
the throne, and books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the
book of life; and the dead were judged from the things which were written in
the books, according to their deeds.” (Revelation 20:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Revelation 20:13, “according to their deeds” means
they will be judged only on their human good works as the basis of their
eternal indictment. Works never measure up to God's absolute righteousness.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and
Hades gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged, every one of
them according to their deeds.” (Revelation 20:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Rejection of Jesus Christ is why the unbeliever is cast
into the Lake of Fire. What the unbeliever does, good or bad, will not ever be
the issue. Rev. 20:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of
life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.” (Revelation 20:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Everyone’s sins were paid for on the Cross. Jesus Christ
will evaluate all unbelievers for their good works – none of which will measure
up to His perfect absolute righteousness. Therefore, all will be cast into the
Lake of Fire for eternity. There are no degrees of punishment in the Lake of
Fire. All will be there for the same reason - rejection of Jesus Christ’s work
on the Cross.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>There Are No Degrees of God's Punishment</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The false belief that there are different degrees of
punishment in the Lake of Fire denies a literal Lake of Fire. There is no
indication in Scripture that the Lake of Fire has different levels of heat or
punishment. If this were true, and it is not, this would mean that God
recognizes works of the flesh and awards an unbeliever a better place in the
Lake of Fire on the basis of human good. Scripture never backs this up.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Degrees of punishment is contrary to the doctrine of
Unlimited Atonement. Man is not judged on the basis of their sins, but upon the
issue of belief in or rejection of the person and work of Christ. If an
unbeliever rejects God at the point of God-consciousness or at the point of
Gospel hearing, they remain in their sins and human good (works). The Great
White Throne Judgment will deal with human good, which is completely
unacceptable to God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Degrees of punishment is based on the false principle of
Hegel. Degrees of punishment also destroys the issue in salvation by diverting
from acceptance or rejection of Christ to sins. Rejection of Jesus Christ as
Savior is l00% condemnation for eternity. </p>
