<h2>Loyalty</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Loyalty is a virtue that cannot be bought. Loyalty is one
of the greatest characteristics of the Christian way of life. Loyalty indicates
stability and orientation to life. Loyalty is an instinctive function from the <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine in a well-constructed edification complex of the soul. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The opposite to loyalty is being a traitor, for example, Judas
Iscariot. Loyalty is always a part of true love. The capacity to love God is
based on Bible doctrine in the right lobe of your soul. With doctrine you can
tell God you love Him. Therefore, consistently learning and applying Bible
doctrine keeps down scar tissue on the soul and builds an edification complex
of the soul. When a believer is negative toward doctrine, they have no capacity
to love and this state of carnality produces scar tissue.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Loyalty is faithfulness to the Lord and His Word. Loyalty
is a faithfulness to those who labor in the Word. Col. 1:7; Rom. 16. </p>

<p class=Verses>“just as you learned it from Epaphras, our beloved fellow
bond-servant, who is a faithful servant of Christ on our behalf,” (Colossians
1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Loyalty is faithfulness to those in the Body of Christ.
Rom. 15:6-7; Phil. 2:2-5; 1 Cor. 15:23-27; 1 Cor. 3:1-4. </p>

<p class=Verses>“so that with one accord you may with one voice glorify the God
and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, accept one another, just as
Christ also accepted us to the glory of God.” (Romans 15:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“make my joy complete by being of the same mind, maintaining
the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose. Do nothing from
selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as
more important than yourselves; do not merely look out for your own personal
interests, but also for the interests of others. Have this attitude in
yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus,” (Philippians 2:2-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual men,
but as to men of flesh, as to infants in Christ. I gave you milk to drink, not
solid food; for you were not yet able to receive it. Indeed, even now you are
not yet able, for you are still fleshly. For since there is jealousy and strife
among you, are you not fleshly, and are you not walking like mere men? For when
one says, &quot;I am of Paul,&quot; and another, &quot;I am of Apollos,&quot;
are you not mere men?” (1 Corinthians 3:1-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Loyalty in the local church is outreach through radio,
internet via websites, podcasts, home Bible classes, recorded media, streaming
media, and missionary outreach. Matt. 28:18-20. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, &quot;All
authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. &quot;Go therefore and
make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and
the Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I commanded you;
and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.&quot;” (Matthew
28:18-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Loyalty is faithfulness to forget the past and focus on
what lies ahead. Phil. 3:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it
yet; but one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to
what lies ahead,” (Philippians 3:13, NASB)</p>
