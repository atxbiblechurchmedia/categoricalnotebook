<h2>Light</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Light in its literal use reminds man that his existence
depends on light. Gen. 1:3; Eccl. 11:7; Jer. 31:35.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then God said, &quot;Let there be light&quot;; and there
was light.&quot;  (Genesis 1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The light is pleasant, and it is good for the eyes to see
the sun.&quot;  (Ecclesiastes 11:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Thus says the LORD, Who gives the sun for light by day
And the fixed order of the moon and the stars for light by night, Who stirs up
the sea so that its waves roar; The LORD of hosts is His name:&quot;  (Jeremiah
31:35, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The physical universe is designed to illustrate spiritual
realities of God's plan. Light reveals the character of God. 1 John 1:5; Rev.
21:23; 1 Tim. 6:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“This is the message we have heard from Him and announce to
you, that God is Light, and in Him there is no darkness at all.”  (1 John 1:5,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the city has no need of the sun or of the moon to shine on
it, for the glory of God has illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb.” 
(Revelation 21:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;who alone possesses immortality and dwells in
unapproachable light, whom no man has seen or can see. To Him be honor and
eternal dominion! Amen.&quot;  (1 Timothy 6:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Light was used for the divine guidance of Israel by
night. Exodus 14:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So it came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of
Israel; and there was the cloud along with the darkness, yet it gave light at
night. Thus the one did not come near the other all night.&quot;  (Exodus
14:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Gospel of Jesus Christ is the light that reveals
divine essence. The Gospel is called the light of the glory of Jesus Christ. 2
Cor. 4:4; 2 Tim. 1:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“in whose case the god of this world has blinded the minds of
the unbelieving so that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory
of Christ, who is the image of God.”  (2 Corinthians 4:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;but now has been revealed by the appearing of our Savior
Christ Jesus, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light
through the gospel,&quot;  (2 Timothy 1:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Being saved brings the believer out of darkness into
light. Luke 1:79; 1 Peter 2:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;TO SHINE UPON THOSE WHO SIT IN DARKNESS AND THE SHADOW OF
DEATH, To guide our feet into the way of peace.&quot;&quot;  (Luke 1:79, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But you are A CHOSEN RACE, A royal PRIESTHOOD, A HOLY
NATION, A PEOPLE FOR God's OWN POSSESSION, so that you may proclaim the
excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous
light;&quot;  (1 Peter 2:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Light portrays the believer’s privilege of possession of a
luminous body in Satan’s world system of evil. Matt. 5:14; Dan. 12:3; 2 Cor.
4:6; Eph. 5:8; Col. 1:12-13; John 12:36; Phil. 2:15; Acts 13:47.</p>

<p class=Verses>““You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot
be hidden;”  (Matthew 5:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For God, who said, “Light shall shine out of darkness,” is the
One who has shone in our hearts to give the Light of the knowledge of the glory
of God in the face of Christ.”  (2 Corinthians 4:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“for you were formerly darkness, but now you are Light in the
Lord; walk as children of Light”  (Ephesians 5:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““For so the Lord has commanded us, ‘I HAVE PLACED YOU AS A
LIGHT FOR THE GENTILES, THAT YOU MAY BRING SALVATION TO THE END OF THE EARTH.’”“ 
(Acts 13:47, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Light is a synonym of the edification complex of the soul
that is constructed from <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine. The believer with the
edification complex reflects the glory of God. Thus a believer “shines.” Psalms
43:3; Psalms 119:130; Rom. 13:12; Eph. 5:8; 1 John 2:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;O send out Your light and Your truth, let them lead me;
Let them bring me to Your holy hill And to Your dwelling places.&quot;  (Psalms
43:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The unfolding of Your words gives light; It gives
understanding to the simple.&quot;  (Psalms 119:130, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The night is almost gone, and the day is near. Therefore
let us lay aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light.&quot; 
(Romans 13:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;for you were formerly darkness, but now you are Light in
the Lord; walk as children of Light&quot;  (Ephesians 5:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;On the other hand, I am writing a new commandment to you,
which is true in Him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the
true Light is already shining.&quot;  (1 John 2:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ was described in His incarnation as the “Light
of the world.” John 3:19; John 8:12; John 12:46; John 9:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>““This is the judgment, that the Light has come into the world,
and men loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil.” 
(John 3:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Jesus again spoke to them, saying, &quot;I am the Light
of the world; he who follows Me will not walk in the darkness, but will have
the Light of life.&quot;” (John 8:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““I have come as Light into the world, so that everyone who
believes in Me will not remain in darkness.”  (John 12:46, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;While I am in the world, I am the Light of the
world.&quot;” (John 9:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Because of the Word’s vital relationship to divine
guidance, it is described in terms of light. Psalms 19:8; Psalms 119:105; Exodus
13:21-22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The precepts of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart; The
commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.”  (Psalms 19:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Nun. Your word is a lamp to my feet And a light to my path.” 
(Psalms 119:105, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD was going before them in a pillar of cloud by day to
lead them on the way, and in a pillar of fire by night to give them light, that
they might travel by day and by night. He did not take away the pillar of cloud
by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people.”  (Exodus
13:21-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The absence of light characterizes man apart from
regeneration (unbeliever) or apart from spirituality (carnal believer). Light is
also used with reference to the believer’s regeneration at salvation. John 8:12;
John 3:19-20; 1 Peter 2:9; Col. 1:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Jesus again spoke to them, saying, “I am the Light of the
world; he who follows Me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the Light
of life.”“  (John 8:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;This is the judgment, that the Light has come into the
world, and men loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were
evil. &quot;For everyone who does evil hates the Light, and does not come to
the Light for fear that his deeds will be exposed.” (John 3:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But you are A CHOSEN RACE, A royal PRIESTHOOD, A HOLY NATION,
A PEOPLE FOR God’s OWN POSSESSION, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of
Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;”  (1 Peter
2:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For He rescued us from the domain of darkness, and transferred
us to the kingdom of His beloved Son,”  (Colossians 1:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Light is used with reference to the believer’s
spirituality. Eph. 5:8-14; Job 3:1-9; 1 John 2:9-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“for you were formerly darkness, but now you are Light in the
Lord; walk as children of Light (for the fruit of the Light consists in all
goodness and righteousness and truth), trying to learn what is pleasing to the
Lord. Do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but instead even
expose them; for it is disgraceful even to speak of the things which are done
by them in secret. But all things become visible when they are exposed by the
light, for everything that becomes visible is light. For this reason it says, “Awake,
sleeper, And arise from the dead, And Christ will shine on you.”“  (Ephesians
5:8-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The one who says he is in the Light and yet hates his brother
is in the darkness until now. The one who loves his brother abides in the Light
and there is no cause for stumbling in him. But the one who hates his brother
is in the darkness and walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is
going because the darkness has blinded his eyes.”  (1 John 2:9-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spirituality is walking in the Light. 1 John 1:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but if we walk in the Light as He Himself is in the Light, we
have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us
from all sin.”  (1 John 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Light depicts the spiritually mature believer’s spiritual
life. 2 Cor. 4:6; Eph. 5:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For God, who said, &quot;Light shall shine out of
darkness,&quot; is the One who has shone in our hearts to give the Light of the
knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 4:6,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For this reason it says, &quot;Awake, sleeper, And arise
from the dead, And Christ will shine on you.&quot;&quot;  (Ephesians 5:14,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ at the Second Advent will come as the Sun of
Righteousness. Mal. 4:2; Matt. 4:2; Matt. 24:29-31.</p>

<p class=Verses>““But for you who fear My name, the sun of righteousness will
rise with healing in its wings; and you will go forth and skip about like
calves from the stall.”  (Malachi 4:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““But immediately after the tribulation of those days THE SUN
WILL BE DARKENED, AND THE MOON WILL NOT GIVE ITS LIGHT, AND THE STARS WILL FALL
from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. “And then the sign
of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and then all the tribes of the earth
will mourn, and they will see the SON OF MAN COMING ON THE CLOUDS OF THE SKY
with power and great glory. “And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT
TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one
end of the sky to the other.”  (Matthew 24:29-31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Judgment in the Word is expressed in the sense of
darkness with regard to heaven or earth. Exodus 10:21; Job 3:4; Matt. 27:45;
Matt. 24:29; John 12:46; Joel 2:2; Rev. 8:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward the
sky, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even a darkness which
may be felt.”“  (Exodus 10:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;May that day be darkness; Let not God above care for it,
Nor light shine on it.” (Job 3:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now from the sixth hour darkness fell upon all the land until
the ninth hour.”  (Matthew 27:45, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But immediately after the tribulation of those days THE
SUN WILL BE DARKENED, AND THE MOON WILL NOT GIVE ITS LIGHT, AND THE STARS WILL
FALL from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.” (Matthew
24:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““I have come as Light into the world, so that everyone who
believes in Me will not remain in darkness.”  (John 12:46, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The eternal state has no night nor need of sun or moon -
God is Light and He will illuminate the universe forever. Rev. 21:23-26; Rev.
22:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And there will no longer be any night; and they will not have
need of the light of a lamp nor the light of the sun, because the Lord God will
illumine them; and they will reign forever and ever.”  (Revelation 22:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the city has no need of the sun or of the moon to shine on
it, for the glory of God has illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb. The
nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their
glory into it. In the daytime (for there will be no night there) its gates will
never be closed; and they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations
into it;”  (Revelation 21:23-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Light Reveals Evil</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Light is seen in a new way, as a revealer of evil. Mark
4:21; Luke 8:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He was saying to them, &quot;A lamp is not brought to
be put under a basket, is it, or under a bed? Is it not brought to be put on
the lampstand? &quot;  (Mark 4:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;Now no one after lighting a lamp covers it over
with a container, or puts it under a bed; but he puts it on a lampstand, so
that those who come in may see the light. &quot;  (Luke 8:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The production of the believer is designed to expose the
evil, to make it manifest. Titus 1:9-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;holding fast the faithful word which is in accordance
with the teaching, so that he will be able both to exhort in sound doctrine and
to refute those who contradict. For there are many rebellious men, empty
talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision, who must be
silenced because they are upsetting whole families, teaching things they should
not teach for the sake of sordid gain.&quot;  (Titus 1:9-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Purpose of light is to make manifest that which was
hidden. Mark 4:22; Luke 8:16-17; Eph. 5:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;For nothing is hidden, except to be revealed; nor
has anything been secret, but that it would come to light. &quot;  (Mark 4:22,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;Now no one after lighting a lamp covers it over
with a container, or puts it under a bed; but he puts it on a lampstand, so
that those who come in may see the light. &quot;For nothing is hidden that will
not become evident, nor anything secret that will not be known and come to
light. &quot;  (Luke 8:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But all things become visible when they are exposed by
the light, for everything that becomes visible is light.&quot;  (Ephesians
5:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Here we see that not only are the things (secret sins) of
others manifested by the production of the believer, but they are reproved by
it. The light reproves as well as manifests. For a believer to cover, conceal,
or neutralize their spiritual production, the light fails to reprove the secret
sins of the other individual. In Ephesians 5:13, “exposed” is <span lang=EL>ἐλέγχω</span>
(elegchō) and means to show someone their sin and to summon them to
repentance. It implies educative discipline.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Believer’s Reflected Light in the Spiritual Life</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The growing believer is to be a light to the world. Matt.
5:14-16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;You are the light of the world. A city set on a
hill cannot be hidden; nor does anyone light a lamp and put it under a basket,
but on the lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house. &quot;Let
your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works,
and glorify your Father who is in heaven. &quot;  (Matthew 5:14-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Light has several meanings in the Greek. The word <span
lang=EL>φῶς</span> (phōs) and means light as seen by the eyes, an organ
adapted for reception. Man in salvation has received the spiritual organ of
reception. In Luke 16:8, believers are called “sons of light” and means a
light, primarily a light giver, one that produces light.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;And his master praised the unrighteous manager
because he had acted shrewdly; for the sons of this age are more shrewd in
relation to their own kind than the sons of light. &quot;  (Luke 16:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Light is used of believers in Philippians 2:15 and used
of Christ in Revelation 21:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and
innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse
generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world,&quot;  (Philippians
2:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And the city has no need of the sun or of the moon to
shine on it, for the glory of God has illumined it, and its lamp is the
Lamb.&quot;  (Revelation 21:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 4:6, light used as an illumination of
the Gospel. Here, light is <span lang=EL>φωτισμός</span> (phōtismos) and
means <span style='background:white'>the act of enlightening or illumination.</span></p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For God, who said, &quot;Light shall shine out of
darkness,&quot; is the One who has shone in our hearts to give the Light of the
knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 4:6,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 24:29, <span lang=EL>φέγγος</span> (pheggos)
is used of the light of the moon. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;But immediately after the tribulation of those
days THE SUN WILL BE DARKENED, AND THE MOON WILL NOT GIVE ITS LIGHT, AND THE
STARS WILL FALL from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
&quot;  (Matthew 24:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The use of light in Matthew 5:14 is <span lang=EL>φῶς</span>
(phōs) implies that those benefitting will have a capacity of reception,
therefore, ability to benefit from it. Therefore, production here is described
as “light” which other believers will be able to see and respond to.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;You are the light of the world. A city set on a
hill cannot be hidden; &quot;  (Matthew 5:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 5:15, “lamp” is <span lang=EL>λύχνος</span>
(luchnos) and refers to a hand-lamp. The term “to give light” is <span lang=EL>λάμπω</span>
(lampō) and means to illuminate so as to see. The basket was a clay earthen
pot used to store flour and was placed under the lampstand. The lampstand was a
protrusion from the wall upon which the lamp was put that the light might
provide light for all that enter the room. The room is the sphere around a
believer in their spiritual production. This would be a pastor and his
congregation, a teacher and their class, a manager in their business. The
lampstand is the location of your spiritual production.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; nor does anyone light a lamp and put it under a basket,
but on the lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house. &quot; 
(Matthew 5:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 5:16, the purpose for the lamp and the
lampstand is that others may see by producing “light” to all in the house. “That
they may see” is the aorist active subjunctive of <span lang=EL>ὁράω</span>
(horaō) and means to perceive, discern, notice, pay attention to. “Good” is <span
lang=EL>καλός</span> (kalos) and means excellent in that it is so constructed
to answer the purpose for which it was created. “Works” is <span lang=EL>ἔργον</span>
(ergon) and is a noble action in this context. “Glorify” is the aorist active
subjunctive of <span lang=EL>δοξάζω</span> (doxazō) and means to magnify,
praise, honor. The purpose being that they might give honor to God.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;Let your light shine before men in such a way that
they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven. &quot; 
(Matthew 5:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Therefore, to cover your production or veil it in
privacy, you keep others from the benefits of your spiritual production of
giving proper glory and honor to God.</p>
