<h2><a name="_D-Maximum_Adversity,_The"></a>Maximum Adversity, Believer’s Triumph</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Introduction</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is a study of what happens to young people during
and after an invasion, in the destruction of cities, and how Bible doctrine
makes the difference. It is based on the death march from Ramah to Babylon
after the complete destruction of Jerusalem in August of 586 BC by the army of
King Nebuchadnezzar.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The author of Psalm 119 is Ezra’s father who suffered the
horrors of that death march as a young teenager and related those experiences
to Ezra who wrote them down. Ezra’s father saw his family decapitated and was
forced to march from Ramah to Babylon suffering horrible abuse. Psalm 119 could
be retitled as, “The Believer’s Triumph in Maximum Adversity.” It describes the
horrors of the Fifth Cycle of Discipline and the death march from Ramah to
Babylon. It also describes how the Lord sustained him under the most extreme of
circumstances.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ezra’s father survived the death march because he had
Bible doctrine in the right lobe of his soul. Are you made of that kind of
stuff? Never without Bible doctrine. Ezra’s father related his experiences about
Ramah to his son Ezra, his march in chains, the drunken and cruel Babylonian
soldiers who came back for the girls, other soldiers for the boys. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We should all know with certainty that God has a plan for
the worst disaster that could ever come our way. They were still alive and God
had a purpose for their lives. Jer. 15:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Your words were found and I ate them, And Your words became
for me a joy and the delight of my heart; For I have been called by Your name,
O LORD God of hosts.”  (Jeremiah 15:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Even with this, God had the solution for those that
remained with horrific problems. Problems that you and I have will never have
to face. Even though you go through the most horrible things and still survive,
God has a purpose for your life. This may sound brutal, but it is true. If you
think such horrors only happened in the distant past, think again.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Remember the Mongol hordes of Genghis Khan in the 13<sup>th</sup>
and 14<sup>th</sup> centuries whose armies would find a city and leave a pile
of skulls in their wake. History indicates that millions were massacred as they
went from city to city. Remember the Japanese Rape of Nanking in 1937 where Japanese
troops butchered more than 200,000 male civilians and raped at least 20,000
women and girls, many of whom were mutilated or killed in the process. Remember
the Russians at Katyn in1939, during the Russian invasion of Poland, some
14,500 Polish officers were massacred and buried in eight mass graves. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>After the destruction of Jerusalem, all the babies,
children, and young people were marched to Ramah. At Ramah was the first great
shock of the people after the fall of Jerusalem. All babes in arms and children
under 10 years old were killed brutally. Those over 10 years old were abused,
tortured, continually raped and taken as slaves. Jer. 31:15; Matt. 2:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Thus says the LORD, “A voice is heard in Ramah, Lamentation
and bitter weeping. Rachel is weeping for her children; She refuses to be
comforted for her children, Because they are no more.”“  (Jeremiah 31:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““A VOICE WAS HEARD IN RAMAH, WEEPING AND GREAT MOURNING,
RACHEL WEEPING FOR HER CHILDREN; AND SHE REFUSED TO BE COMFORTED, BECAUSE THEY
WERE NO MORE.”“  (Matthew 2:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When the mothers screamed, they were slaughtered or
tortured. History is filled with brutal armies like this. It was the policy of
all ancient armies to leave the children behind. If the children over 10 couldn’t
keep up, they were clubbed or speared.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mothers were told to stop their crying even though they
had faced the worst that any woman can face. In addition to that, the teenagers
were suffering from the shock of their younger brothers and sisters being
killed and/or abused. Most of the children (ages 10-13) lived and suffered at
the hands of the soldiers. Most of the men had been killed. All men over 35
years old were killed. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The structure of Psalm 119 is based on 22 letters in the
Hebrew alphabet and is an acrostic Psalm with eight verses in each file. Ezra’s
father lived through the death march and lived to see the triumph of Bible
doctrine in his life. He taught his son well for Ezra became the great man of
the Lord in his day. Ezra 7:10; Hebrews 8. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For Ezra had set his heart to study the law of the LORD and to
practice it, and to teach His statutes and ordinances in Israel.”  (Ezra 7:10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Aleph File - Prosperity Under Pressure</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Aleph in the Hebrew language means Ox and is not an “a”
but is a guttural. There are no vowels in the Hebrew language – all letters are
consonants. In Psalms 119:1, “blessed” is the plural of <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>אשׁר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (‘esher) and means happinesses. “Those
whose way is blameless” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>תּמים</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span>
(tâmı̂ym) and refers to those with an edification complex of the soul who are equipped
for anything. They are equipped for disaster, for tragedy, for heartache, for
success, and for changing circumstances. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Aleph. How blessed are those whose way is blameless, Who walk
in the law of the LORD.”  (Psalms 119:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:2, “observe” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>נצר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (nâtsar) and means to guard, to protect,
to cultivate soil. This means to convert Bible doctrine from <i>gnosis</i> to <i>epignosis</i>
in the soul. The qal active participle shows continuous action in present
time.  “Testimonies” is Bible doctrine pertaining to the God-head, the essence
of God, the Person of God, and the plan of God. “Seek” is positive volition
towards doctrine.</p>

<p class=Verses>“How blessed are those who observe His testimonies, Who seek
Him with all their heart.”  (Psalms 119:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There never has been in the history of the human race, a
problem, an adversity, a disaster, a frustration, a heartache too difficult for
the plan of God. Ezra’s father went through the fifth cycle of discipline, saw
his family killed, was a slave, walked back to Babylon and came out of these
things in a marvelous way. Sooner or later you are going to find a problem too
big for you to handle and you will have to trust God and the content of His
Word. “All their heart” refers to the essence of the right lobe of the soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Psalms 119:3 says that even though they have old sin
natures, they do not produce human good or sin because they were filled with
the Holy Spirit. Anything you do must be done in the filling of the Spirit. “They
walk in His ways” is using the grace apparatus for perception to learn Bible
doctrine with resultant application of Bible doctrine from the right lobe of
the soul. This is the spiritual life.</p>

<p class=Verses>“They also do no unrighteousness; They walk in His ways.” 
(Psalms 119:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:4, “You have ordained” means to decree, to
appoint. It is the piel perfect of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>צוה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (tsâvâh). The piel stem is very intensive.
The perfect tense means God decreed in eternity past, that all our problems,
heartaches, disasters, were known by Him. We are to keep spiritual precepts
diligently. “Precepts” are Bible doctrine treated categorically.  “Should keep”
means to guard, to protect, to utilize. Isaiah 28:10; Isaiah 28:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“You have ordained Your precepts, That we should keep them
diligently.”  (Psalms 119:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““For He says, ‘Order on order, order on order, Line on line,
line on line, A little here, a little there.’““  (Isaiah 28:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So the word of the LORD to them will be, “Order on order,
order on order, Line on line, line on line, A little here, a little there,”
That they may go and stumble backward, be broken, snared and taken captive.” 
(Isaiah 28:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Psalms 119:5 states the desire of Ezra’s father as he
begins the death march. He is in shackles as a slave and will be tortured,
abused and maltreated in many ways. “My ways” is the operation of the Holy
Spirit in the human spirit to transfer spiritual phenomena to the left lobe of
the soul as <i>gnosis</i> and if believed, to transfer the believed Bible
doctrine to the right lobe of the soul as <i>epignosis</i>. “Be established”
refers to the cycling of Bible doctrine in the soul. “To keep Your statutes”
refers to Bible doctrine categorically stored in the right lobe in the edification
complex ready to apply to life’s situations.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“Oh that my ways may be established To keep Your statutes!” 
(Psalms 119:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:6, “ashamed” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>בּוּשׁ</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (bûsh) and means to not
be confused. The antonym is confidence. They know right from wrong. Their norms
and standards are correct. They know where they stand at all times. They use confession
of sin, if out of line. “When I look upon” means to look on something with
pleasure, with positive volition. You want it immediately. Matt. 4:4; Jer.
15:16; Job 23:12. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then I shall not be ashamed When I look upon all Your
commandments.”  (Psalms 119:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But He answered and said, “It is written, ‘MAN SHALL NOT LIVE
ON BREAD ALONE, BUT ON EVERY WORD THAT PROCEEDS OUT OF THE MOUTH OF GOD.’“ “ 
(Matthew 4:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Your words were found and I ate them, And Your words became
for me a joy and the delight of my heart; For I have been called by Your name,
O LORD God of hosts.”  (Jeremiah 15:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““I have not departed from the command of His lips; I have
treasured the words of His mouth more than my necessary food.”  (Job 23:12,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:7, “uprightness of heart” is the proper
frame of reference in the norms and standards in the right lobe of the soul. “When
I learn” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>למד</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span>
(lâmad) and means to learn the hard way with knots on your head. “Your
righteous judgments” means there is much to learn and some will be learned the
hard way. Prosperity depends upon knowledge of Bible doctrine - <i>gnosis</i>
converted to <i>epignosis</i> by God the Holy Spirit and transferred to the
right lobe of the soul.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I shall give thanks to You with uprightness of heart, When I
learn Your righteous judgments.”  (Psalms 119:7, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:8, “statutes” is Bible doctrine learned
categorically and in the right lobe of the soul.  Ezra’s father wanted the Lord
to keep him alive long enough to get a completed edification complex or
spiritual maturity. He wanted to live long enough to see God’s grace in action
under maximum adversity.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I shall keep Your statutes; Do not forsake me utterly!” 
(Psalms 119:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Beth File – The Plan of God</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew letter Beth means house and refers to the plan
of God in salvation, the Christian way of life, and in eternity. This is the
second day of the march. He was a slave, an animal, a nothing. He would be
abused and tortured by the Chaldean guards. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Psalms 119:9 presents the confession of sin challenge. How
can a teenager keep himself pure? Most teenagers aren’t concerned about this
today. The attitude is “What is the crowd doing and how far can I go and not
get caught?” </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Beth. How can a young man keep his way pure? By keeping
it according to Your word.&quot;  (Psalms 119:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The answer is; “by keeping it according to Your Word.”  It
is the Word of God guarding the soul, guarding the mind, guarding the emotions,
guarding the conscience, and so on. By doing so while under pressure, he doesn’t
crack. He knew how to handle it. He was keeping short accounts with God and staying
in followship a maximum amount of the time. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Psalms 119:10-11 involves inner stability. “With all my
heart” refers to the inner spiritual life, the way the Word of God is taken in.
When does a teenager need to get the Word? Now. “I have sought You” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>דּרשׁ</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(dârash)
in the perfect tense and refers to the time he spent in the Word before this
happened. He had evidently gotten away from the Word for a while.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;With all my heart I have sought You; Do not let me wander
from Your commandments. Your word I have treasured in my heart, That I may not
sin against You.&quot;  (Psalms 119:10-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To “wander” is the hiphil imperfect of <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שׁגה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(shâgâh)
and means to be caused to stray, to get out of fellowship under abnormal
circumstances. “Commandments” refers to Bible doctrine obeyed and applied in
the spiritual life. “Your Word I have treasured” is the qal perfect and refers
to events in the past. He can’t study now. He is dependent upon what he has already
learned.  “Your Word have I treasured in my heart.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As a teenager, he regarded the Word more valuable than
anything in the world. He thought it was more important than dating. He thought
it was more important than going down to the local poolhall with the boys. He
thought it was more important than sitting around all night and listening to
some live band or looking at the latest thing on TV. He thought it was more
important than eating. It was the thing that counted.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is a lot more than giving lip service. What is
important to you? Pleasure, social life, TV, surfing, hunting, fishing? All of his
details of life were taken away. Where is your treasure? Is it Bible doctrine? “That
I may not sin” means to make a false step, to downgrade Bible doctrine. This
would be throwing his treasure away and treading the Word of God underfoot. Matt.
5:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Whoever then annuls one of the least of these
commandments, and teaches others to do the same, shall be called least in the
kingdom of heaven; but whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great
in the kingdom of heaven.&quot;  (Matthew 5:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:12, we have the praise factor. “Blessed are
You” describes the character of God from the standpoint of one who knows
doctrine. “Teach me” is the piel imperfect of <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>למד</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(lâmad) and means to
diligently teach. This is a short, intensive prayer. “I need more Bible
doctrine.” “Statutes” refers to <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the right
lobe of the soul ready to be applied.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Blessed are You, O LORD; Teach me Your statutes.&quot; 
(Psalms 119:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:13, we have the mechanics of confession.
“With my lips” is an idiom for confession. “I have told” means to enumerate
sins that have been judged already. “All the ordinances of Your mouth”
recognizes that Bible doctrine gives God’s judicial verdict concerning sin.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;With my lips I have told of All the ordinances of Your
mouth.&quot;  (Psalms 119:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Psalms 119:14-16 presents the result of being in
fellowship. “I have rejoiced (inner happiness) in the way of Your testimonies
(Bible doctrine pertaining to the Godhead), as much as in all riches (he
treasures God’s Word).” It is easier to be filled with self-pity, mental
attitude sins, and with whining. “Why did God let this happen to me?” “I will
meditate on Your precepts” refers to the origin and preservation of the Word
and thus the preservation of God’s Word for the believer. He is saying that it is
marvelous that he has Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I have rejoiced in the way of Your testimonies, As much
as in all riches. I will meditate on Your precepts And regard Your ways. I
shall delight in Your statutes; I shall not forget Your word.&quot;  (Psalms
119:14-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“And regard Your ways” means to anticipate with extreme
pleasure God’s ways. One of God’s ways is Bible class. He keeps pulling Bible doctrine
out of his soul’s frame of reference. “I shall delight in Your statutes” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שָׁעַע</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(shaa)
and means to take delight in and means he is passionate about the <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine categorized in the right lobe of his soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“I shall not forget Your word” means the battle is in the
soul and his soul is intact. He is occupied with Christ. His treasure is Bible
doctrine. He delights in Bible doctrine. He anticipates Bible doctrine. He
loves to learn and apply Bible doctrine every day. There is the answer. I will
not forget or neglect Your Word.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Gimel File – The Wisdom of God’s Word</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew letter Gimel means camel, beast of burden, well-traveled.
Psalms 119:17 indicates that the believer must have an extensive knowledge and
wisdom of God’s Word in their soul.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Gimel. Deal bountifully with Your servant, That I may
live and keep Your word.&quot;  (Psalms 119:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Deal bountifully” is the qal imperative of <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>גּמל</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(gâmal)
and means to benefit me, to be benefitted by the plan of God. This avoids the trap
where any detail of life gains a higher priority over the intake of Bible
doctrine. These details of life include money, success, pleasure, social life,
loved ones, friends, health, sex, materialistic things, and status symbols.
This also avoids the trap where a person goes negative and will not avail
themselves of Bible doctrine. The third trap avoided is the mental attitude sin
trap of jealousy, pride, bitterness, hostility, revenge, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Your servant” refers to the believer. “That I may live”
means living in the Word, using the grace apparatus for perception for learning
Bible doctrine. “And keep Your Word” is an idiom for using the Word all the
time. We are to keep it in the right lobe of our souls, ready for use at all

commandments.&quot;  (Psalms 119:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:22, “Take away reproach and contempt from
me” means to take away the disgrace that belongs to the fifth cycle of
discipline by casting all cares upon the Lord. “For I observe Your testimonies”
means you know whether or not you are in fellowship and whether or not you are
pleasing the Lord. This is a statement of fact, not of boasting.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Take away reproach and contempt from me, For I observe
Your testimonies.&quot;  (Psalms 119:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:23, “princes sit and talk against me”
refers to the pressure from men in high authority. His father was the high
priest. “Your servant meditates on Your statutes” means he had divine viewpoint

<p class=Verses>&quot;Your testimonies also are my delight; They are my
counselors.&quot;  (Psalms 119:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Daleth File – The Entrance Into the Plan of God</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew letter Daleth represents a door or entrance
and refers to entrance into the plan of God. God can take care of all my
problems. Doctrine is greater than any disaster, any catastrophe, or any
heartache.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:25, “My soul cleaves” is the qal perfect of
<span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>דּבק</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(dâbaq) and  means to be glued to something, to adhere.
What has happened since he has been taken a slave? “To the dust” means my soul
is glued to the dust. This is used three ways in Scripture. With reference to
the human body in Genesis 3:19, with reference to resurrection in Daniel 12:9,
and with reference to pressure or disaster. He is saying, “I am under maximum
suffering conditions.” There is physical suffering. “Revive me according to
Your word” is the piel imperative of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>חָיָה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span><span

<p class=Verses>&quot;Daleth. My soul cleaves to the dust; Revive me according
to Your word.&quot;  (Psalms 119:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;By the sweat of your face You will eat bread, Till you
return to the ground, Because from it you were taken; For you are dust, And to
dust you shall return.&quot;&quot;  (Genesis 3:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He said, &quot;Go your way, Daniel, for these words are
concealed and sealed up until the end time.&quot;  (Daniel 12:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:26, “I have told of my ways” is confession
of wicked ways. “You have answered me” means he confessed his sins to God the
Father and was restored to fellowship. “Teach me Your statutes” means now he
can learn more Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I have told of my ways, and You have answered me; Teach
me Your statutes.&quot;  (Psalms 119:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:27, “Make me understand” is the hiphil

dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(bı̂yn) and means cause me to be able to apply from my
frame of reference. Let me apply the doctrine I have in my soul. “So I will
meditate on Your wonders” refers to his intent to witness to these soldiers.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Make me understand the way of Your precepts, So I will
meditate on Your wonders.&quot;  (Psalms 119:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:28, “My soul weeps because of grief” is the
inner cries from extreme pressure, the whimpering of a person who is suffering
beyond endurance. He could lose his mind at this point. He is depressed and is
in danger of losing his patriotism or becoming bitter. “Strengthen me according
to Your word” is the piel imperative of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>קוּם</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(qûm) and means to
build muscle by lifting weights and refers to exercising spiritually with Bible
doctrine.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;My soul weeps because of grief; Strengthen me according
to Your word.&quot;  (Psalms 119:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:29, “Remove the false way from me” means to
cause one to turn aside from the way of vanity. “Remove” is the hiphil
infinitive of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>סוּר</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(sûr) and means to take away, remove, to turn aside.
The “false way” refers to the details of life. He could play up to the guards
and get extra food and extra favors. “Graciously grant me Your law” refers to
Bible doctrine. Be gracious to me with Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Remove the false way from me, And graciously grant me
Your law.&quot;  (Psalms 119:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:30, “I have chosen the faithful way” means
he has chosen the way of doctrine. “I have placed Your ordinances before me”
means he knows this is the only way to go at any time. He is satisfied with
what God is doing. He is not whining about his fate or bemoaning the fact that he
is on this death march. He is resting in the Lord’s provision.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I have chosen the faithful way; I have placed Your
ordinances before me.&quot;  (Psalms 119:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:31, “I cling” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>דּבק</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(dâbaq) and means to
cling or adhere, figuratively to catch by pursuit. It means his soul is glued
to Bible doctrine. There is not enough misery, trauma, etc. in this world to
destroy the soul that is glued to Bible doctrine. “Do not put me to shame” is
the hiphil imperfect of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>בּוּשׁ</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(bûsh). The action is not completed. He is looking down
the line and saying, “Don’t let me get confused down the line by the prolonging
of pressure.”</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I cling to Your testimonies; O LORD, do not put me to
shame!&quot;  (Psalms 119:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:32, “I shall run the way of Your
commandments” means he can’t run anywhere because he is chained physically, but
his soul can still seek refuge in the Word. “Enlarge my heart” means more
spiritual growth, more capacity to handle the situations. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I shall run the way of Your commandments, For You will
enlarge my heart.&quot;  (Psalms 119:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>He File – The Perspective of the Believer</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew letter He means window or the perspective of
the believer. He is looking out of the window of his life with divine
viewpoint. This is the daytime part of the march when they are on the move. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:33, “Teach me” refers to the doctrine learned
through the grace apparatus for perception. “Statutes” refers to Bible doctrine
in the right lobe of the soul. Hunger for the Word of God is characterized by parents
teaching doctrine daily to their children, the pastor-teacher’s daily teaching of
Bible doctrine, the believer accepting that doctrine by faith and then applying
it to life’s situations and problems. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He. Teach me, O LORD, the way of Your statutes, And I
shall observe it to the end.&quot;  (Psalms 119:33, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“I shall observe it” means to guard it in their soul. “To
the end” means until the end of the death march or the end of his life for
death is imminent. The principle here is to never look back. If you fall down,
get back in fellowship and keep moving. This is the principle of being
faithful. Jude 1:24.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling, and to
make you stand in the presence of His glory blameless with great joy,&quot; 
(Jude 1:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:34, “Give me understanding” means
comprehension, a spiritual frame of reference and actually using the Word of
God by applying it. “That I may observe Your law” refers to Bible doctrine
categories. These categories include the doctrine of relationship and
fellowship, the doctrine of confession of sin, the doctrine of claiming God's promises,
and the doctrine of faith-rest. “Keep it” is keeping everything in perspective,
seeing the panorama of God’s Word. “With all my heart” is with the whole inner
being, the soul having a well-filled frame of reference.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Give me understanding, that I may observe Your law And
keep it with all my heart.&quot;  (Psalms 119:34, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:35, “Walk in the path of Your commandments”
is living the spiritual life according to the will of God revealed in the Word
of God. Following the plan of God is the most important thing a believer can
do. “For I delight in it” means he has a love affair with God's commandments.
The word “commandments” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL>מצוה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(mitsvâh)
and means Bible doctrine obeyed and applied with pleasure. When the chips are
down, you finally appreciate the Word of God for what it is.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Make me walk in the path of Your commandments, For I
delight in it.&quot;  (Psalms 119:35, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:36, “Incline” means to draw my thoughts to
you. “Testimonies” refers to remembering the essence of God. “Dishonest gain”
refers to someone he envies who isn’t on the death march, has it easy, and is
enjoying the details of life. Greater is He that is in you, that he (Satan)
that is in the world. 1 John 4:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Incline my heart to Your testimonies And not to dishonest
gain.&quot;  (Psalms 119:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“You are from God, little children, and have overcome them;
because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world.” (1 John 4:4,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:37, “from looking at vanity” refers to the
emptiness of it all. The emptiness of life apart from Bible doctrine. “Revive
me in Your ways” is a spiritual revival of the soul through learning, accepting,
and applying Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Turn away my eyes from looking at vanity, And revive me
in Your ways.&quot;  (Psalms 119:37, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:38, “Establish Your word to Your servant”
refers to making Bible doctrine a part of their soul structure – the
edification complex of the soul.  “Reverence for You” means spiritual growth
becomes a devotion with the mind of Jesus Christ and occupation with Him.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Establish Your word to Your servant, As that which
produces reverence for You.&quot;  (Psalms 119:38, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:39-40, “Turn away my reproach” is the
failure that often occurs after a night of debauchery. He has seen enough and
experienced enough brutality that it can affect his mental attitude. “Which I
dread” means he doesn’t want to get out of fellowship when they abuse him.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Turn away my reproach which I dread, For Your ordinances
are good. Behold, I long for Your precepts; Revive me through Your
righteousness.&quot;  (Psalms 119:39-40, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Behold, I long for Your precepts” is Bible doctrine that
he longs to hear communicated to him.  “Revive me through Your righteousness”
is the spiritual growth and the change of thinking that Bible doctrine brings. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What is his prospective? Day after day learning Bible
doctrine, using it, applying it. Every step he takes, he takes with doctrine. What
can we do for our young people? Give them more categorical doctrine, and more,
and more, and more. There will be a time of maximum intake, and little
application, but the time of testing that will require maximum application of
Bible doctrine will come.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Vav File - Bible Doctrine Anchors the Believer’s Life</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew letter Vav represents a nail, peg or hook.
Bible doctrine is presented as the peg or the hook on which the believer hangs their
life. The peg or the hook stays in one place and produces stability.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:41, “May Your lovingkindnesses also come”
means God's grace in action. God never treats us as we deserve. This is
appreciation for His grace and Bible doctrine circulating in the thought
pattern of the soul. “Your salvation” refers to deliverance, not being saved as
he is already a believer.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Vav. May Your lovingkindnesses also come to me, O LORD,
Your salvation according to Your word;&quot;  (Psalms 119:41, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“According to Your word” means the deliverance from this death
march by application of Bible doctrine to every tough situation. He doesn’t
especially want to escape the pain. He doesn’t want to be delivered by human
activity. He wants the spiritual deliverance, which God has through Bible doctrine.
The only standard for soul stability is the assimilation of the Word of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:42, “an answer for him who reproaches me”
refers to a griping, miserable buddy who didn’t get Bible doctrine. “Reproach”
is the qal active participle of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>חָרַף</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(charaph) and means to malign, to deplore, to revile, to
resent. They resented him to the point of reviling him. Christians can be cruel
in their negative volition.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So I will have an answer for him who reproaches me, For I
trust in Your word.&quot;  (Psalms 119:42, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Apparently he was receiving a lot of verbal insults from
the other slaves. They resented divine viewpoint and orientation to God's grace.
Believers and/or unbelievers without doctrine can be very obnoxious. He not
only has to put up with the soldiers, but he had to put up with rotten
attitudes among others on the death march. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“For I trust in Your word” is the qal perfect of  <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>בּטח</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(bâṭach)
and means to slam your troubles on the Lord as a wrestler slams his opponent to
the mat.  This indicates that he has already placed this in the Lord’s hands
and he is sitting tight. Put the matter in the Lord’s hands and do not
retaliate. Vengeance belongs to the Lord.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:43, “And do not take the word of truth”
refers to the peg or hook, the stabilizer. “Take” is the hiphil imperfect causative
of  <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>נצל</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(nâtsal) and means to snatch away. “Out of my mouth”
means he will utter grace words and divine viewpoint. When he does, they will
be snatched away. He is talking about witnessing to them and their resulting negative
reactions.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And do not take the word of truth utterly out of my
mouth, For I wait for Your ordinances.&quot;  (Psalms 119:43, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“For I wait for Your ordinances” means he is trusting in
God's promises under pressure. “Wait” is the piel perfect of <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>יחל</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(yâchal)
and means to be patient, to hope, to trust, to wait. He has put his hope in Bible
doctrine, regardless of the pressure. Believers are to meet opposition by
trusting in God's promises and His deliverance. Psalms 55:22</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Cast your burden upon the LORD and He will sustain you;
He will never allow the righteous to be shaken.&quot;  (Psalms 55:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We must meet retaliation by claiming the promise of Romans
12:19. Forgive as Christ forgave. Phil. 3:13.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Never take your own revenge, beloved, but leave room for
the wrath of God, for it is written, &quot;VENGEANCE IS MINE, I WILL
REPAY,&quot; says the Lord.&quot;  (Romans 12:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of
it yet; but one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to
what lies ahead,&quot;  (Philippians 3:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:44, “So I will keep Your law” means he will
guard the Word. The nail is in the wall forever. He intends to hang his entire
life on that hook called Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So I will keep Your law continually, Forever and
ever.&quot;  (Psalms 119:44, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:45, “I will walk at liberty” means he will
walk in comprehensiveness, in breadth of mind. He is saying, “I am too weak to
walk physically, so I am going to walk by what I think.” He has the Word in the
right lobe of his soul in his frame of reference. “For I seek Your precepts” is
Bible doctrine presented categorically, line upon line, precept upon precept.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And I will walk at liberty, For I seek Your
precepts.&quot;  (Psalms 119:45, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:46, “I will also speak of Your testimonies”
refers to Old Testament Christology where he was centering Jesus Christ in his
thoughts. “Before kings” means he will survive to speak to Persian kings, to
stand before Nebuchadnezzar. He knows that Bible doctrine will give him an
audience at some time. Bible doctrine will give you an audience. “And shall not
be ashamed” is reference to the Bible doctrine in his soul. Rom. 1:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I will also speak of Your testimonies before kings And
shall not be ashamed.&quot;  (Psalms 119:46, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power
of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the
Greek.&quot;  (Romans 1:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is a walking Bible class in embryo form. By the time
they arrive in Babylon, they have a core of people who are interested in Bible
doctrine. In 536 BC, the first wave will go back and in 516 BC the first temple
will be completed. Why? A surge of interest in learning Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:47, “I shall delight” is the hithpael
imperfect of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שָׁעַע</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(shaa) and means to take delight in. This is the Hebrew
word for the strongest love between husband and wife. It is the Hebrew word for
passionate love. Here, he has a passionate love for the Word and an intimacy
with it. Keep on doing this. Doctrine every day. This is the word he uses in
reference to his love for the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I shall delight in Your commandments, Which I
love.&quot;  (Psalms 119:47, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He uses a strong word to indicate strong love under
adverse conditions. When used of God, it is expressed as a mental attitude
love, it is relaxed mental attitude rapport love all the way, it is occupation
with Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He is courting Bible doctrine every chance he gets. He is
living in the Word. He is tough. “Which I love” is in the perfect tense and
means he has always loved doctrine. Since he is carrying Bible doctrine, he can
teach it on the march. Apparently they need it. These people will be the basis
of the Golden Age of Israel.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:48, “And I shall lift up my hands” is
fervent desire. This is as close as he can come to expressing the love concept
of “I will delight.” At this time, he has no hope of a wife, yet he will have a
very wonderful wife. At this time he has no hope of a home, yet he will have a
very wonderful home. At this time he has no hope of a job, yet he will be
occupied in a very wonderful way.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And I shall lift up my hands to Your commandments, Which
I love; And I will meditate on Your statutes.&quot;  (Psalms 119:48, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What does he have now? Nothing. Yet, he has everything in
Bible doctrine in the right lobe of his soul. This is divine wisdom. He has the
most right now. “Your commandments, Which I love” is in the perfect tense and
means he has always loved Bible doctrine, the Word of God.  “And I will
meditate on Your statutes” refers to his thought control while in fellowship
focused only on Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><a name="_Maximum_Adversity,_Believer’s"></a><b>Zayin
File - The Word of God is a Weapon</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew letter Zayin represents a weapon. The weapon
is the Word of God. It is not only an offensive weapon against others, but it
also refreshes just as target practice with a hand gun can be relaxing. The
Word of God as a weapon provides refreshment and relaxation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:49, “Remember” is the qal imperative of <span

dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(zâkar)
and means to call to remembrance, to have Bible doctrine in the right lobe of
the soul and in this case in the frame of reference. The ability to recall.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Zayin. Remember the word to Your servant, In which You
have made me hope.&quot;  (Psalms 119:49, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“The word to Your servant” means he is asking the Lord to
help him recall the Word he received when he previously had done his homework.
Remember, he is under terrific pressure. “You have made me hope” is the hiphil imperfect
and means to cause me to keep on with faith-rest under maximum pressure.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:50, “This is my comfort” refers to usable
doctrine resident in the right lobe of the soul. The Word of God provides inner
comfort and inner strength during times of disaster. “My affliction” refers to
his present trial. “Your word has revived me” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>חָיָה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(chayah)
and means to take in oxygen, to be refreshed by oxygen, to live. Using the
grace apparatus for perception results in soul refreshment. Daily it is often
the thing that is left out.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;This is my comfort in my affliction, That Your word has
revived me.&quot;  (Psalms 119:50, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:51, “The arrogant utterly deride me” refers
to the Chaldean soldiers who make fun of him and scorn him. “I do not turn
aside from Your law” means he has not veered, has no mental attitude sins, no
sins of the tongue, and no overt sinful activity. Therefore, he is stabilized
and oriented to the Word of God resident in his soul.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The arrogant utterly deride me, Yet I do not turn aside
from Your law.&quot;  (Psalms 119:51, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:52, “I have remembered Your ordinances from
of old” refers to the Mosaic Law. Here, it is Bible doctrine recalled under the
circumstances. He is remembering the times before the invasion when he could be
at home and learn Bible doctrine under relaxed circumstances. The good old
days, the days when we had Bible doctrine around here.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I have remembered Your ordinances from of old, O LORD,
And comfort myself.&quot;  (Psalms 119:52, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Comfort myself” means he is using his inner spiritual resources
where he calls upon the premises, techniques, doctrines, and principles of the
Word of God. “Myself” comes from the hithpael stem and is reflexive. He is not
dependent upon anyone else at this point. He is spiritually self-sustaining.
And, yes, this is in a young person.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:53 is a terrible test. “Burning indignation
has seized me” refers to the brutality of a death march. He is at the mercy of
the soldiers. The indignation has seized him suddenly and without warning.
Every great disaster you face is without warning. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Burning indignation has seized me because of the wicked,
Who forsake Your law.&quot;  (Psalms 119:53, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Unexpected disaster will hit a nation when they forfeit
their freedom for promises of peace and security. Then, seemingly out of
nowhere comes sudden destruction. “The wicked” refers to the brutal Chaldean
soldiers who ignored the principles of morality, the divine institutions, and salvation.
They were animals.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:54, “Your statutes” refers to Bible
doctrine arranged into categories in the right lobe of the soul ready to go. “Are
my songs” is the inner melody of his life that is Bible doctrine. Eph. 5:19.
Doctrine is the basis for true singing. “In the house of my pilgrimage” is an
idiom for a foreign country. He is out of his own land as in Psalms 137.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Your statutes are my songs In the house of my
pilgrimage.&quot;  (Psalms 119:54, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual
songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord;&quot;  (Ephesians
5:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:55, “I remember Your name” refers to the
person of Jesus Christ. “In the night” are the night hours where he was too
bruised to sleep, it was too noisy and too horrible. “And keep Your law” means
he has not dishonored the Word of God.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;O LORD, I remember Your name in the night, And keep Your
law.&quot;  (Psalms 119:55, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:56, “This has become mine” refers to the
death march in which he sees the Lord’s mercy and grace in action. Imagine
saying that in the midst of a horrible death march. “I observe Your precepts”
means he has applied the Bible doctrine from his soul. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;This has become mine, That I observe Your
precepts.&quot;  (Psalms 119:56, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Heth File – The Believer’s Protection</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew letter Heth refers to an enclosure or a fence.
This represents the grace of God protecting the believer on earth rather than
taking them home. God has provided for every situation in life until He takes
you home to eternity. God has provided for every disaster in time. God puts a
fence of Bible doctrine within and without for the believer.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:57, “my portion” is him keeping the Word by
living by it, letting it uphold him, relying on it, and letting God's grace
protect and strengthen him through it all.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Heth. The LORD is my portion; I have promised to keep
Your words.&quot;  (Psalms 119:57, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:58, “I sought Your favor with all my heart”
means he made a special appeal from his soul for God's grace. God always treats
us in grace, no matter what the circumstances. “Be gracious to me according to
Your word” is the qal imperative and means on a standard with Your Word. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I sought Your favor with all my heart; Be gracious to me
according to Your word.&quot;  (Psalms 119:58, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers who believe their works will cause God to
bestow His grace on them will say, “The Lord has been rough on me.” The grace
oriented believer says, “The Lord has been gracious to me.” What is your
security? Upon what or who do you depend? Bible doctrine or your ability to
work, your ability to scheme, your ability to operate some deal?</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:59, “I considered my ways” refers to an
introspective self-examination of the believer’s spiritual growth status.  “And
turned my feet” is the hiphil imperfect of <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שׁוּב</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(shûb)
and is a reference to confession of sin to God the Father and the resultant
recovery of fellowship with God.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I considered my ways And turned my feet to Your
testimonies.&quot;  (Psalms 119:59, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:60, “I hastened” is positive volition and
means he hurried to get Bible doctrine in a crash program. He didn’t let
anything stand in the way of Bible doctrine so he could have inner confidence
that he was living by the Word and in the Word.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I hastened and did not delay To keep Your
commandments.&quot;  (Psalms 119:60, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Psalms 119:61 presents opposition of the wicked. “The
cords of the wicked have encircled me” means they abused him and violated his
privacy. He stood for grace and got opposition. “I have not forgotten Your law”
means he was determined to stay in fellowship during the assault even though he
was going through hell.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The cords of the wicked have encircled me, But I have not
forgotten Your law.&quot;  (Psalms 119:61, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:62, “At midnight” means that by midnight
the abuse was over. “I shall rise to give thanks to You” is gratitude toward
God based on God's grace resources enabling him to maintain his grace
orientation through the abuse. The soul remained intact, but the body was
battered. “Because of Your righteous ordinances” means that he knew that the
Lord would take care of the Babylonians and the Lord would provide.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;At midnight I shall rise to give thanks to You Because of
Your righteous ordinances.&quot;  (Psalms 119:62, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:63, “I am a companion of all those who fear
You” means he declared himself to be on the side of those with Bible doctrine.
This was his Bible class. “Fear” refers to respect for the Word of God and
fellowship with other believer prisoners who were using faith-rest. “Your
precepts” refers to Bible doctrine stored categorically in the soul.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I am a companion of all those who fear You, And of those
who keep Your precepts.&quot;  (Psalms 119:63, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:64, “The earth is full of Your
lovingkindness.” Why? Because inside the believer, the Lord develops perfect
environment of the soul. He carried his environment with him through the death
march. Bible doctrine in his soul enabled him to have the proper mental
attitude. “Teach me Your statutes” means he wanted to know more Bible doctrine.
He just couldn’t get enough. Once you taste doctrine, you want more and more
and more. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The earth is full of Your lovingkindness, O LORD; Teach
me Your statutes.&quot;  (Psalms 119:64, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Teth File - Relationship</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew letter Teth refers to the concept of
relationship. The word “good” stands out. You should know the difference
between divine good and human good.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:65, “You have dealt well” is <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>עָשָׂה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(asah)
and means to make something out of something. He is saying that the Lord has
taken care of him on the death march. Sooner or later you are going to hit
maximum disaster. But you won’t be ready for it unless your attitude toward
Bible doctrine is improved. Rom. 8:28</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Teth. You have dealt well with Your servant, O LORD,
according to Your word.&quot;  (Psalms 119:65, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And we know that God causes all things to work together
for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His
purpose.&quot;  (Romans 8:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“With Your servant” indicates relationship with the Lord.
“According to Your word” means according to the Word of God - Bible doctrine. The
principle here is that every believer has a relationship with the Lord, but
only those believers who know the Word appreciate it and make use of God's
grace resources identified in the Word.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:66, “Teach me good discernment and
knowledge” means discernment that accompanies <i>epignosis</i> knowledge in the
soul. This is ability to think with the principles and promises of Bible
doctrine under disaster conditions. It is the ability to take in God’s Word and
use it under pressure when needed. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Teach me good discernment and knowledge, For I believe in
Your commandments.&quot;  (Psalms 119:66, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Teach” is the piel imperative of <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>למד</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(lâmad) and means to
teach over and over with authority, to learn under adversity, intensive
teaching under intensive pressure. He has believed the Bible doctrine and has
applied it to his life. He understands it well.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:67, “Before I was afflicted” was before the
fifth cycle of discipline had hit the nation. “I went astray” means he wandered
from the things that he knew. “But now I keep Your word” is the qal perfect of <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שׁמר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(shâmar)
and means to guard, to protect, to keep. He has kept the Word.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Before I was afflicted I went astray, But now I keep Your
word.&quot;  (Psalms 119:67, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:68, “You are good” refers to the character
of God, the plan of God, the will of God, and the person and work of Christ.
God has manufactured good out of disaster because He is intrinsic good. He knew
Bible doctrine, had wandered from it, but came back to it through disaster.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;You are good and do good; Teach me Your statutes.&quot; 
(Psalms 119:68, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“And do good” means to cause good to come out of
disaster. For example, the bones of Joseph in Genesis 50. What if you and some
others you know were chained together? It would be a delight to be chained to
some, but a real drag with others. “Teach me Your statutes” means to teach the
categories of Bible doctrine so your soul cannot be swept away by disaster.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:69, “the arrogant” are the Chaldean
soldiers. “Have forged” means they have accused him falsely. “With all my heart
I will observe Your precepts” means he will apply all of the Bible doctrine he
has in the compartments of the right lobe of his soul, in his frame of
reference, his memory center, his conscience, and his norms and standards from
the viewpoint of his knowledge of the will of God.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The arrogant have forged a lie against me; With all my
heart I will observe Your precepts.&quot;  (Psalms 119:69, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:70, “Their heart is covered with fat”
refers to the Chaldean soldier’s soul. This is an idiom for stupidity of the
soul.  Their self-consciousness was filled with great pride, they were the
victors, they were in the driver’s seat and were in control. Their mentality
was full of mental attitude sins. Their volition was used to decide how to
amuse themselves with the captives. Their emotions were in emotional revolt,
they wanted anything sensual, their emotions ran them. The conscience was that of
animals, brutal. Their old sin natures were out of control. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Their heart is covered with fat, But I delight in Your
law.&quot;  (Psalms 119:70, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They had stupid, insensitive, distorted, and twisted souls.
Here the victim is stable, but the soldiers are unstable. “But I delight in
Your law” refers to his rapport love with Bible doctrine and God's statutes and
promises. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:71, “It is good for me that I was
afflicted” refers to the spiritual growth that results of from testing. “Learn
Your statutes” refers to categorical Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the
soul. It is one thing to know Bible stories, but quite another to know the
doctrines of Scripture. Rom. 8:28.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;It is good for me that I was afflicted, That I may learn
Your statutes.&quot;  (Psalms 119:71, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And we know that God causes all things to work together
for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His
purpose.&quot;  (Romans 8:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:72, “The law of Your mouth” is the content
of Bible doctrine which he felt was better for him than having great monetary
wealth. Bible doctrine was better, more pleasant, more agreeable, and more
profitable to him in extreme testing than a great amount of gold and silver.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The law of Your mouth is better to me Than thousands of
gold and silver pieces.&quot;  (Psalms 119:72, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Yod File – God's Plan, Power, and Eternal Security </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew letter Yod refers to the hand or the authority
of God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:73, “Your hands” refers to the hands of
God. This is used in many ways, to show His plan, His power, and the eternal
security He provides. The hands of the Creator are alluded to as well as the
hands of the Savior. He is telling what doctrine has done for him. This is the
turning point. Remember what they learned in the home. He looks back over the
years and recalls his first Bible class.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Yodh. Your hands made me and fashioned me; Give me
understanding, that I may learn Your commandments.&quot;  (Psalms 119:73, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Made me” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>עָשָׂה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(asah) and means to
make something out of something. This refers to the Lord as a potter who is
molding him. This is a reference to the Lord allowing certain things to come
into his path that keeps him strong and keeps him growing spiritually. “Fashioned
me” is in the piel stem of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>כּוּן</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span

within the right lobe of his soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Give me understanding” is the hiphil causative of <span

dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(bı̂yn)
and means to be caused to recall something that has already been learned. He is
beginning to cycle the doctrine that is in his soul for application to what is
going on around him and to him. “That I may learn Your commandments” is <span

dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(lâmad)
to learn with a frame of reference so that one can communicate that truth to
others.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Psalms 119:74 shows the encouragement that a believer can
have on others. “May those who fear You see me and be glad” refers to the other
believers on the death march who will be glad to see the young man who is
operating on Bible doctrine. Philemon 1:6. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;May those who fear You see me and be glad, Because I wait
for Your word.&quot;  (Psalms 119:74, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and I pray that the fellowship of your faith may become
effective through the knowledge of every good thing which is in you for
Christ's sake.&quot;  (Philemon 1:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Often during the night, prisoners would die or be weak
and be cut loose to die. He would always be alive as an encouragement to others
and a token of the grace of God. “Because I wait for Your word” is <span

dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(yâchal)
and means to trust under maximum pressure.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Psalms 119:75 presents the greatest testimony you can
have as a believer. “I know” is the qal perfect of <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>ידע</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(yâda‛) and means comprehension,
to learn under an academic situation. This learning was a completed action in
past time. “Your judgments are righteous” means he understands the essence of
God.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I know, O LORD, that Your judgments are righteous, And
that in faithfulness You have afflicted me.&quot;  (Psalms 119:75, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“That in faithfulness” means he understands the essence
of God and His character. He knows that God is immutable and cannot change. He
also knows that knowing His character through the intake and application of
Bible doctrine stabilizes the believer. “You have afflicted me” means he sees
divine viewpoint in his afflictions. Even when the Lord disciplines you, He is
faithful.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:76, “O may Your lovingkindness comfort me”
means he wants to let grace be his comfort. What does he want for comfort? What
would you want for comfort? The right man for you? The right woman for you? A
new home that is paid for? A new car? More clothes? What comforts you? What
does he want for comfort? He wants the Word of God which is inherently usable
for dealing with problems.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;O may Your lovingkindness comfort me, According to Your
word to Your servant.&quot;  (Psalms 119:76, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He applies the Word to himself before others. We must
remember this. You get Bible doctrine from His Word. God enables you through
the power of the Holy Spirit to handle everything. “According to Your word to
Your servant” means that he is going to communicate Bible doctrine from his
soul to others. The only answer to problems and bad situations then and now is
the Word of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:77, “May Your compassion come to me” means
he is asking for more grace. He doesn’t ask for food, physical comfort,
protection or that the disaster be removed. He asks for more of God's grace. “That
I may live” refers to his reason that he wants to live. That reason is that he
loves Bible doctrine and the opportunity to communicate it. What else is there
to live for?</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;May Your compassion come to me that I may live, For Your
law is my delight.&quot;  (Psalms 119:77, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:78, “May the arrogant be ashamed, for they
subvert me with a lie” is a prayer that the arrogant brutal Babylonian soldiers
will become confused, not ashamed. They have dealt with him badly without
cause. He put the matter entirely into the Lord’s hands.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;May the arrogant be ashamed, for they subvert me with a
lie; But I shall meditate on Your precepts.&quot;  (Psalms 119:78, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:79, “May those who fear You turn to me”
means he is occupied with Christ in his soul and prays that they will turn to
him to teach them Bible doctrine. He prays that they will listen and have
positive volition. “Even those who know Your testimonies” means all these
believers need to be built up. His burden is for believers.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;May those who fear You turn to me, Even those who know
Your testimonies.&quot;  (Psalms 119:79, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:80, “May my heart be blameless in Your
statutes” refers to categorically presented Bible doctrine in his soul’s frame
of reference, his memory center, his conscience containing doctrinal norms and
standards, and in his viewpoint – divine viewpoint. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;May my heart be blameless in Your statutes, So that I
will not be ashamed.&quot;  (Psalms 119:80, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“So that I will not be ashamed” means that he prays that he
might not mislead. He wants to be accurate. Thus, he is in the Lord’s hands,
the Lord has a purpose for his life and he is beginning to enable him to realize
it.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Kaph File – We Are in His Plan Forever</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Kaph is the Hebrew letter representing the hollow or palm
of a hand. This file refers to the fact that we are in God's plan as long as we
live. Being in the plan of God doesn’t depend upon you, it depends upon God’s
character. It de-emphasizes who and what we are. Our only qualification for the
grace of God is that we are alive.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Before we can learn doctrine, we need to unlearn
tradition and prejudice. We need to get off of our emotional revolt, our guilt
complexes, and our inferiority complexes that say; “God can never use me.” When
we say such a thing, we are saying in effect that God cannot meet our failures
and our sinfulness.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This country is full of pride. It is full of Christians who
say when you have committed certain types of sins, you are all washed up. “The
bird with the broken pinion will never fly again.” If you are alive right now,
God has a plan specifically for you and you have more yet to do. God takes you
home when your work on earth is completed, not one second before. Get off of this
weird idea that you are important. It’s not about your talent, your good looks,
your scintillating personality, or your self-important life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:81, “My soul languishes” refers to
emotional revolt in the soul. Self-pity in your self-consciousness. When you
get mad in your mentality against someone in the local church, you say “That
church is going to the dogs.” A fainting soul always turns everything into hurt
ego.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Kaph. My soul languishes for Your salvation; I wait for
Your word.&quot;  (Psalms 119:81, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>With respects to volition, a fainting soul always makes a
lot of hot-headed and ridiculous decisions. In emotional revolt, there are tantrum
activities, panic palace, and getting into apostate activities like the tongues
movement. In the conscience, this involves getting into some taboo movement.
This is your emotions controlling your thinking.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“For Your salvation” refers to deliverance. You are not
to entertain the sins of the soul, your soul kinks. You are to confess the sins
to God the Father and enjoy the resulting fellowship. There is no place for compensating
for your sins, or “making it up to God,” or promising you will do better. The
principle here is that a fainting soul is a believer who is alive, but who has
not even gotten to the point of confession of sin. “I wait for Your word” is
the greatest virtue in the Christian life - to know the Word of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:82, “My eyes fail with longing for Your
word” means his eyes were exhausted. This is an indication of a tired mind and
extreme mental and physical exhaustion. They were suffering from lack of sleep.
They were suffering from lack of food. They were suffering from mental
exhaustion. They were suffering from physical exhaustion. He was so exhausted
he couldn’t think straight.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;My eyes fail with longing for Your word, While I say,
&quot;When will You comfort me?&quot;&quot;  (Psalms 119:82, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ways have been found to break a man down by keeping them
from sleep so they shine bright lights in their eyes and make them sit up all
night. “When will You comfort me?” isn’t a question, but he is praying; “When I
am receiving comfort.” The piel stem means his comfort came from inner soul resources.
Rom. 8:25. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But if we hope for what we do not see, with perseverance
we wait eagerly for it.&quot;  (Romans 8:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He doesn’t have a thing he can depend upon from the
outside. In all this exhaustion, the enabling power of the Holy Spirit sustained
him. The Holy Spirit enabled him to recall the Bible doctrine in his soul even
under extreme conditions. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is God the Holy Spirit sustaining the believer just
as the Holy Spirit sustained our Lord hanging on the Cross when God the Father
had forsaken our Lord in order to impute the sins of the world to His body and
then to judge them. The enabling power of the Holy Spirit with the Bible
doctrine in the right lobe of your soul empowers your spiritual life like the
very air you breathe for your physical life. Psalms 138:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I will bow down toward Your holy temple And give thanks
to Your name for Your lovingkindness and Your truth; For You have magnified
Your word according to all Your name.&quot;  (Psalms 138:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:83-85, even under extreme physical and
mental hardship, there are fragrances of memories. We are to live our lives one
day at a time depending entirely on God's grace resources. This is our mandate
even when we receive persecution from people with mental attitude sins. This
maybe the hardest spiritual test of them all.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Though I have become like a wineskin in the smoke, I do
not forget Your statutes. How many are the days of Your servant? When will You
execute judgment on those who persecute me? The arrogant have dug pits for me,
Men who are not in accord with Your law.&quot;  (Psalms 119:83-85, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:86-88, when we are under undeserved
suffering, our Lord understands. People are often unfair. Even when premature
death seemed imminent, the Lord was his strength. We are to use God's grace
resources to keep our thinking true to the Word that is in us.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;All Your commandments are faithful; They have persecuted
me with a lie; help me! They almost destroyed me on earth, But as for me, I did
not forsake Your precepts. Revive me according to Your lovingkindness, So that
I may keep the testimony of Your mouth.&quot;  (Psalms 119:86-88, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><a name="_Maximum_Adversity,_Believer’s_1"></a><b>Lamedh
File – Confession of Sin Returns Us to Fellowship</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew letter Lamedh file represents an ox goad. This
was the goad that got the ox out of first gear and into second and finally into
cruising gear. The lamedh file speaks of confession of known sins to God the
Father that puts us back into fellowship with the Lord and into spiritual usefulness.
The confession of sin offering in the Word was an ox or a red heifer. In a
study of the Levitical offerings, Christ represents the ox who died on the Cross
for our sins. The goad was Christ bearing our sins.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:89, “Forever” means eternity past to
eternity future. “Your Word” is the whole realm of Bible doctrine. This existed
from eternity past and will continue to exist through eternity future. The
Bible is the mind of Christ. 1 Cor. 2:16; Psalms 138:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Lamedh. Forever, O LORD, Your word is settled in
heaven.&quot;  (Psalms 119:89, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL
INSTRUCT HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I will bow down toward Your holy temple And give thanks
to Your name for Your lovingkindness and Your truth; For You have magnified
Your word according to all Your name.&quot;  (Psalms 138:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:89, “settled in heaven” means that God’s
plan always existed in eternity past. God is perfect so His plan is perfect.
God is eternal so His plan is eternal. Therefore, the Word of God is eternal.
God's Word will never cease to exist. “Settled” is the niphil passive voice of <span

dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(nâtsab)
and means to receive permanence. Matt. 24:35.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will
not pass away.&quot;  (Matthew 24:35, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:90, God’s Word reveals God’s faithfulness. “Generations”
means there is never a generation left without a witness of God (God
consciousness) or Gospel hearing. Everything depends upon the faithfulness of
God.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Your faithfulness continues throughout all generations;
You established the earth, and it stands.&quot;  (Psalms 119:90, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“You established” is the piel perfect of <span lang=HE

dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(kûn)
and means to adjust, to direct, to give cohesion, to stabilize, to provide
direction and purpose. “The earth” refers to Jesus Christ who holds the earth
on course through His divine laws and power. The Lord Jesus Christ sustains the
universe. The continuation of the universe depends upon the omnipotence and
immutability of Jesus Christ. Col. 1:17; Heb. 1:3</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He is before all things, and in Him all things hold
together.&quot;  (Colossians 1:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He is the radiance of His glory and the exact
representation of His nature, and upholds all things by the word of His power.
When He had made purification of sins, He sat down at the right hand of the
Majesty on high,&quot;  (Hebrews 1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>So called “scientific laws” are not laws at all because
science has no way of enforcing them or guaranteeing them. Scientific laws are
based on the statistical assumption that the universe, which operates according
to a fixed norm, will continue to do so. Science can’t determine if the
universe and the “scientific laws” will continue as they are now. They just
assume it will. The universe, matter, energy and operational laws of the
universe will not always exist as they do now. 2 Peter 3:10-12; Rev. 20:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, in which
the heavens will pass away with a roar and the elements will be destroyed with
intense heat, and the earth and its works will be burned up. Since all these
things are to be destroyed in this way, what sort of people ought you to be in
holy conduct and godliness, looking for and hastening the coming of the day of
God, because of which the heavens will be destroyed by burning, and the
elements will melt with intense heat!&quot;  (2 Peter 3:10-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat upon it,
from whose presence earth and heaven fled away, and no place was found for
them.&quot;  (Revelation 20:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To allow God the Father’s plan to run its full course,
Jesus Christ is keeping the universe together. The laws of the universe can be
overruled and changed by Jesus Christ. Like Elijah, He cancelled gravity over
the spot where He stood and He became a free floater immediately. The laws of
the universe were overruled on the day the sun stood still for Joshua and for
certain miracles. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Known scientific laws depend entirely upon the
faithfulness of God. By the Word of His power, Jesus Christ hold the universe
together. His reason for doing so is to resolve the Angelic Conflict and to “bring
many sons to glory.” Col. 1:17; Heb. 1:3; Heb. 2:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He is before all things, and in Him all things hold
together.&quot;  (Colossians 1:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He is the radiance of His glory and the exact
representation of His nature, and upholds all things by the word of His power.
When He had made purification of sins, He sat down at the right hand of the
Majesty on high,&quot;  (Hebrews 1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things, and
through whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to perfect the
author of their salvation through sufferings.&quot;  (Hebrews 2:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Even though Jesus Christ overrules His laws whereby
miracles or supernatural phenomena can take place, He never ever overrules or
changes His promises or His Word – Bible doctrine. That He cannot change. Psalms
119:89.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Lamedh. Forever, O LORD, Your word is settled in
heaven.&quot;  (Psalms 119:89, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Therefore, scientific laws are simply the faithfulness of
Jesus Christ holding the universe together, holding back eternity so the human
race will have the opportunity to appropriate the grace of God and live by the grace
of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:91, “They stand this day” means He sees the
sun rise and He sees the sun set. The laws of the universe continue each day
according to His purpose – Bible doctrine pertaining to the person of Christ. “For
all things are Your servants” means that divine law governs the universe to
allow the earth to be the battleground for resolving the Angelic Conflict.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;They stand this day according to Your ordinances, For all
things are Your servants.&quot;  (Psalms 119:91, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:92, “If Your law had not been my delight”
uses the Hebrew word for caressing, desire, passion, and love. The Word is the
love of his life. It is his passion in life. “I would have perished in my
affliction” means the Word has made living worthwhile and is what kept him
going.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If Your law had not been my delight, Then I would have
perished in my affliction.&quot;  (Psalms 119:92, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:93, “I will never forget Your precepts”
means it is easy to forget the Word unless you have it stored as <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine in the right lobe of your soul in categories. “For by them You
have revived me” means he was not in emotional revolt. He was in fellowship.
Bible doctrine was controlling his soul.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I will never forget Your precepts, For by them You have
revived me.&quot;  (Psalms 119:93, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:94, “I am Yours, save me” means he was
praying for the Lord to deliver him. He wanted to stay alive, and wanted the
Lord to give him the strength to stand up. He wanted to have the strength to
speak each day.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>So many of these young people were so busy partying,
running around and having a good time that it never occurred to them to get
Bible doctrine. “For I have sought Your precepts” is the qal perfect of <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>דּרשׁ</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(dârash)
and means to realize the value of something in prosperity. He was looking back
to the days when he learned Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I am Yours, save me; For I have sought Your
precepts.&quot;  (Psalms 119:94, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Back in Jerusalem, when there was peace and prosperity,
when there was no Chaldean invasion, when Jerusalem was a thriving and
wonderful city, and when the normal pleasures and routines of life existed. Most
of you can plan your day and you have your routines and pleasures. Nothing is
really pressing you to get with Bible doctrine except your pastor-teacher.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:95, “The wicked wait for me to destroy me”
refers to the Chaldean soldiers who have tried to ambush him. They wish he
would die. They mock him. “I shall diligently consider Your testimonies” refers
to Bible doctrine pertaining to the person and work of the Lord Jesus Christ.
God had a purpose for him. God has a purpose for anyone who will learn Bible
doctrine. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The wicked wait for me to destroy me; I shall diligently
consider Your testimonies.&quot;  (Psalms 119:95, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:96, “I have seen a limit to all perfection”
means he was saying he was disillusioned about all people. He thought that when
the enemy came, men would be great heroes. Instead, they were cowards, adults
and young men alike. He learned the country could not be saved by people. There
is no need to depend upon people. With Bible doctrine you can enjoy people even
though they are fickle. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I have seen a limit to all perfection; Your commandment
is exceedingly broad.&quot;  (Psalms 119:96, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Your commandment are exceedingly broad” means there is
no limit to Bible doctrine, no limited what His Word can do. People are limited
and the body is limited. He was disillusioned about people, but there was no
disillusionment about Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Mem File – The Water of the Word</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew letter Mem originally signified water. It refers
to the “water of the Word” in Ephesians 5:26. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;so that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the
washing of water with the word,&quot;  (Ephesians 5:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:97, “O how I love Your law” means rapport
love, delight. “It is my meditation all the day” means it was in his thought
pattern, the right lobe of the mentality of his soul. He was constantly using
his frame of reference, recalling doctrine, having God’s norms and standards,
and recalling divine viewpoint and exercising it.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Mem. O how I love Your law! It is my meditation all the
day.&quot;  (Psalms 119:97, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“All the day” refers to the function of the grace
apparatus for perception through study and public assembly and through
meditation when you can’t study or assemble publicly. He was teaching Bible
class.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:98, “make me wiser than my enemies” means
that although he had no physical weapon, yet inside of him was the greatest
weapon of all. He had learned Bible doctrine, he understood it and was using
it. “For they are ever mine” refers to his enemies. He also always had the Word
of God in his soul to apply. With God's grace resources and according to God's
plan, he will survive and live longer than his enemies.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Your commandments make me wiser than my enemies, For they
are ever mine.&quot;  (Psalms 119:98, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:99, “I have more insight” is <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שָׂכַל</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(sakal)
and means expert, skillful. “Than all my teachers” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>למד</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(lâmad) and means to
goad, to teach with the rod. “Are my meditation” means he is experiencing
considerable thought control under the extreme pressures.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I have more insight than all my teachers, For Your
testimonies are my meditation.&quot;  (Psalms 119:99, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:100, “I understand more than the aged”
means that under extreme pressure and testing, you validate the Bible doctrine
in your soul through repeated application to life’s problems. This is divine
wisdom in the soul.  He realized that through his suffering, he had more <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine in his young soul when compared to even old men. This is
spiritual growth and erecting an edification complex of the soul as rapidly as
possible even though young in age. “Because I have observed Your precepts”
refers to the other prisoners who guarded him, but he guarded the Bible
doctrine in his soul. James 1:2-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I understand more than the aged, Because I have observed
Your precepts.&quot;  (Psalms 119:100, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter
various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance. And
let endurance have its perfect result, so that you may be perfect and complete,
lacking in nothing.&quot;  (James 1:2-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:101, “I have restrained my feet from every
evil way” refers to his resistance to false doctrine before the death march.
That is why he learned so much. Today, he wouldn’t get involved in anything
that kept him from daily learning more Bible doctrine. “That I may keep Your
word” means he put learning Bible doctrine and building his edification complex
of the soul as top priority. He even put doctrine before schoolwork.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I have restrained my feet from every evil way, That I may
keep Your word.&quot;  (Psalms 119:101, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:102, means that he adhered to doctrinal
warnings and never got away from the daily intake of the Word of God. He knew
that to do so would be disastrous to his spiritual life.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I have not turned aside from Your ordinances, For You
Yourself have taught me.&quot;  (Psalms 119:102, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:103, “How sweet are Your words to my
taste!” means he studied the Word regularly just as he ate regularly. Honey
gave stimulation, health, and nourishment. It was the candy of the ancient
world. By analogy, it protected him from false doctrine. “Sweeter than honey to
my mouth” means he considered Bible doctrine of highest importance. Job.
23:12.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;How sweet are Your words to my taste! Yes, sweeter than
honey to my mouth!&quot;  (Psalms 119:103, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;I have not departed from the command of His lips; I
have treasured the words of His mouth more than my necessary food.&quot;  (Job
23:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:104, he gets Bible doctrine categorically
in his soul and, therefore he is discerning and hates false doctrine
(religion).</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;From Your precepts I get understanding; Therefore I hate
every false way.&quot;  (Psalms 119:104, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Nun File - Provision in the Midst of Judgment</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Nun is the Hebrew letter that represents a fish. A
fish always seems to have food, shelter, and clothing. Fish escaped the
judgment on the earth in the flood. The fish stands for provision in the midst
of judgment and shows that the Lord takes care of our daily needs through Bible
doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Psalms 119:105 indicates that Bible doctrine provides the
basis for divine guidance. “Your word is a lamp” means that divine guidance for
the Christian is tied up in the Word. The Word is revealed as the mind of
Christ. The most informed believers today are the believers with Bible
doctrine. God doesn’t lead through an itch between the shoulder blades. God
doesn’t use bolts of lightning to nudge you in the right direction. God doesn’t
lead through the emotions. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Nun. Your word is a lamp to my feet And a light to my
path.&quot;  (Psalms 119:105, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:106, Bible doctrine is the answer to
production and performance and consistency. “I have sworn” means I have
conviction. “I will confirm it” refers to follow-through and desire to not fail
in keeping God's righteous ordinances – Bible doctrine. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I have sworn and I will confirm it, That I will keep Your
righteous ordinances.&quot;  (Psalms 119:106, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:107, “I am exceedingly afflicted” means he
is under maximum suffering. “Revive me” means learning and applying Bible
doctrine can be like a cold drink of water under a hot Texas sun. Bible
doctrine is the source of refreshment. It produces inner happiness even under
extreme suffering. Your social life isn’t going to refresh you ultimately.
Bible doctrine in the right lobe of your soul will.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I am exceedingly afflicted; Revive me, O LORD, according
to Your word.&quot;  (Psalms 119:107, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Psalms 119:108 means that Bible doctrine stimulates the
volition to learn more Bible doctrine when available. “Freewill offering” is
stimulation from the area of volition. He couldn’t give them money or a box of
candy. “Accept” is the qal imperative of <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>רצה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(râtsâh) and means
to take pleasure in my freewill offering. His offering was the communication of
Bible doctrine. “Teach me” means there are still some things I need to know. Believers
will never learn all of the mind of Christ no matter how long we live. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;O accept the freewill offerings of my mouth, O LORD, And
teach me Your ordinances.&quot;  (Psalms 119:108, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:109, “My life is continually in my hand” is
an idiom for being close to physical death. He was still hanging on even though
he was weak and helpless. Bible doctrine in his soul and staying in fellowship kept
him stable and focused even under these extreme conditions. “I do not forget
Your law” means that he was right on the edge and still Bible doctrine
captivated his thoughts.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;My life is continually in my hand, Yet I do not forget
Your law.&quot;  (Psalms 119:109, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:110, “The wicked have laid a snare for me”
means they have tried to trap him and get him to shut up by putting an extra
load on him. “Yet I have not gone astray from Your precepts” means that he
passed the criticism test, the destruction test, and the threatening test. The
enabling power of the Holy Spirit enabled him to stay on track and keep his
thinking focused on divine viewpoint.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The wicked have laid a snare for me, Yet I have not gone
astray from Your precepts.&quot;  (Psalms 119:110, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Psalms 119:111 speaks of Bible doctrine as our heritage
and the heritage of his Bible teachers, of his grandfather, and his father. The
greatest heritage in the world is parents who live by and teach Bible doctrine
to their children. They didn’t leave him any money, property, or anything
pleasant, but yet they gave him the very spark of what was worthwhile, Bible
doctrine. “They are the joy of my heart” refers to him pulling memories from
his soul’s frame of reference. His conscience had Bible doctrine as the top
priority. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I have inherited Your testimonies forever, For they are
the joy of my heart.&quot;  (Psalms 119:111, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:112, “I have inclined” is <span lang=HE

dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(nâṭâh)
and means he has doubled every effort to make a sprint for the tape in the 10-mile
run. It means to kick through, to give all that you have in that moment, to
give everything you have in the clutch and pull through. “To perform Your
statutes Forever” refers to maximum use of Bible doctrine in the soul’s frame
of reference, conscience, and viewpoint. “Even to the end” means he was going
to give out the Word until he died, no matter what happened. He was saying; “As
long as I live, Bible doctrine is going to be the focus of my life.” Bible
doctrine endures forever.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I have inclined my heart to perform Your statutes
Forever, even to the end.&quot;  (Psalms 119:112, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Samekh File - The Lever of God’s Plan</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Samekh is the Hebrew letter for a fulcrum. The samekh
file illustrates how the fulcrum of God’s Word lifts, through His plan, the
sufferings, pressures, disasters, difficulties, and details of life. If you
have no fulcrum of Bible doctrine in your soul, the lever of God’s plan can’t
do you any good.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:113, “I hate those who are double-minded”
means he hates those who are in doubt. It is an idiom for having confidence. He
<span lang=EL>ςα</span>s in a horrible situation. The wicked had the
ascendancy. “But I love Your law” means he kept on having confidence because he
loved God's Word. He loved Bible doctrine because he knew it was always his
confidence.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Samekh. I hate those who are double-minded, But I love
Your law.&quot;  (Psalms 119:113, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:114, “my hiding place” is the place where
he can retreat, a place where he can relax in the Word. “My shield” is his
protector. Since he loved the Word, he used the Word as his shield.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;You are my hiding place and my shield; I wait for Your

lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(yâchal) and means
to use faith in a situation where there is total confusion and disaster. It
means to have a strong faith and thus to be able to concentrate on the promises
of God, the Word of God, the plan of God and stay out of emotional revolt.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:115, “Depart from me evildoers” is a
technical term used of a believer in emotional revolt. He gave a command to
separate from believers who were in panic mode, screaming and falling apart. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Depart from me, evildoers, That I may observe the
commandments of my God.&quot;  (Psalms 119:115, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“That I may observe the commandments of my God” means he won’t
go back on the Word. He will keep the commandments of God. The evildoer is the
type of Christian company you get just before time to go to Bible class or
church services. So you stay home from Bible class and visit with them. Believers
are commanded to assemble together for Bible class for the intake of the Word. Heb.
10:25.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the
habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more as you see the day
drawing near.&quot;  (Hebrews 10:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:116, “Sustain me” is the qal infinitive of <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>סמך</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(sâmak)
and means to support, to lean on, to uphold.  It is God’s plan to uphold him.
He had the lever of God’s plan, not a crutch. There is a great deal of
difference between a crutch and a lever. A crutch is sublimation and  dependance
on the details of life. The Word is not a crutch. He was praying for God to
sustain him so he would not be confused or ashamed even for a second.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Sustain me according to Your word, that I may live; And
do not let me be ashamed of my hope.&quot;  (Psalms 119:116, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:117, “Uphold me” is actually “refresh me.”
It is also support in the sense of refreshment. “That I may be safe” means
literally to be delivered. This does not mean to be removed from disaster, but
to be refreshed with your inner soul freedom even in the midst of disaster. “That
I may have regard” means to concentrate on something. “Your statutes” refers to
his concentration on the categorical Bible doctrine in his soul and he wwould
do it continually.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Uphold me that I may be safe, That I may have regard for
Your statutes continually.&quot;  (Psalms 119:117, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:118, “You have rejected” means to carry
away and refers to the fifth cycle of discipline. They had erred by wandering away
from categorical Bible doctrine. Because they wandered away from doctrine, they
had gone into slavery. “Their deceitfulness” means intrigue, conspiracy against
teachers of categorical doctrine, against the Word of truth.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;You have rejected all those who wander from Your
statutes, For their deceitfulness is useless.&quot;  (Psalms 119:118, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:119, “You have removed all the wicked of
the earth” refers to the land of Judah, the ones who have rejected Bible
doctrine, those who depended upon the details of life. “Like dross” means that
God had purified the people bringing out those who are true to the Word, the
faithful remnant of believers. “Therefore, I love Your testimonies” are the
testimonies of Bible doctrine in the Old Testament through the Levitical
Offerings which all refer to the salvation work of Jesus Christ on the Cross.
Gen. 3:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;You have removed all the wicked of the earth like dross;
Therefore I love Your testimonies.&quot;  (Psalms 119:119, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And I will put enmity Between you and the woman, And
between your seed and her seed; He shall bruise you on the head, And you shall
bruise him on the heel.&quot;&quot;  (Genesis 3:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:120, “My flesh trembles for fear of You”
means he was occupied with Christ. “I am afraid of Your judgments” means he
understood what the Lord does to a nation that forgets the Lord. Lev. 26:27-46;
Deut. 28:49-67.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;My flesh trembles for fear of You, And I am afraid of
Your judgments.&quot;  (Psalms 119:120, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Ayin File - Perspective From the Application of Bible
Doctrine</b> </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew letter Ayin stresses perspective and
application. He saw the difficulties of life and what he saw by application he
matched up with what he knew. Doctrine in the right lobe was looking out at the
situations of life even while under severe suffering at the time. The “eyes” of
his soul looked at life through the lens of Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:121, “I have done” is <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>עָשָׂה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(asah)
and means to make something out of something. The first something is doctrine,
the second something is ability to cope with disaster. Out of doctrine has come
application to judgment and justice. He realized the judgment of God through
the fifth cycle of discipline had resulted in justice that removed those that
opposed God and His Word, abolishment of the idols, and so on. He was able also
to maintain his integrity before God on these things. “Do not leave me to my
oppressors” means to let him live that he may go on to do marvelous things.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Ayin. I have done justice and righteousness; Do not leave
me to my oppressors.&quot;  (Psalms 119:121, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:122, “Be surety for Your servant” means to
be my security and my pledge. He was out of the land. He wanted the Lord to
promise to get him back into the land someday. “For good” refers to divine
good, so that the plan of God can go on for Israel in the land.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Be surety for Your servant for good; Do not let the
arrogant oppress me.&quot;  (Psalms 119:122, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Do not let the arrogant oppress me” means to keep him
away from the legalists. These are the taboo people, the human good people, the
holiness group, the kooks. The human good man always oppresses the grace man.
Churches have pastors to protect the sheep from the bullying of legalism. You
have the right to live your own life as unto the Lord.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:123, “My eyes fail with longing for Your
salvation” means he was saying that he knows at this point that he was going to
live through this. He had a good healthy perspective, not, “I wish I were
dead.” “And for Your righteous word” refers to the surety of knowing Bible
doctrine. He knew Bible doctrine would propel him along. It was his life. He
clung to the promises and doctrines of God.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;My eyes fail with longing for Your salvation And for Your
righteous word.&quot;  (Psalms 119:123, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:124, “Deal with Your servant” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>עָשָׂה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(asah)
and means to make something out of something. God takes you, adds Bible
doctrine to your soul, and manufactures something out of you by means of grace resulting
in a life of spiritual production and usefulness.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Deal with Your servant according to Your lovingkindness
And teach me Your statutes.&quot;  (Psalms 119:124, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s grace provides everything you need to mature spiritually
and be productive in the plan of God. “Teach” is the piel imperative of <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>למד</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(lâmad)
and means to learn Bible doctrine out of Bible class by being kicked around by
training and by discipline. This is learning doctrine the hard way.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:125, “I am Your servant” means he belonged
to God and was God's property. He was relaxed by thinking the battle is the
Lord’s. “Give me understanding” is the hiphil imperative of <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>בּין</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(bı̂yn)
and means to cause to understand. Because he belonged to the Lord, he didn’t
want to do anything stupid. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I am Your servant; give me understanding, That I may know
Your testimonies.&quot;  (Psalms 119:125, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He wanted God to cause him to understand Bible doctrine
academically. This is the same meaning as <span lang=EL>γνώσις</span> (gnosis)
in the Greek. This is Bible doctrine understood academically, but not yet
believed and transferred by the Holy Spirit to the right lobe of the soul. He
realized that for the rest of his life he must learn Bible doctrine. This is
the key to everything.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“That I may know” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>ידע</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(yâda‛) and means to
have believed Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the soul. This is the same
meaning as <span lang=EL>επίγνωσις</span> (epignosis) in the Greek. It is
having Bible doctrine in those shelves of the edification complex of the soul ready
for application. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:126, “It is time for the Lord to act” means
he knew that it was time for him to stop hustling and let the Lord do the heavy
lifting. The Lord must be able to work through the believer with Bible doctrine
in their soul. The horse and the ox can’t plow together unless they pull
together. The Lord can work as soon as you understand the grace principles and
get on daily intake of Bible doctrine. “To act” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>עָשָׂה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(asah)
again. The Lord makes use of the positive believer in fellowship with Bible
doctrine in their soul. “Have broken Your law” refers to those with negative
volition who ignore Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;It is time for the LORD to act, For they have broken Your
law.&quot;  (Psalms 119:126, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:127, “Therefore I love Your commandments above
gold” refers to his perspective regarding Bible doctrine. He valued it far
above gold and was the priority of his life. It is the basis for handling the
details of life. “Above fine gold” is refined gold in all its beauty and
purity.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore I love Your commandments Above gold, yes, above
fine gold.&quot;  (Psalms 119:127, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:128, “Therefore I esteem right” was his
perspective of looking at life through the lens of Bible doctrine. This is
divine viewpoint. They are fantastic, absolute norms and standards. He esteemed
it all as absolutely correct. Doctrine is the measuring stick for everything in
life. “All Your precepts” refers to Bible doctrine in all its categories. This
is knowing the whole counsel of the Word of God. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore I esteem right all Your precepts concerning
everything, I hate every false way.&quot;  (Psalms 119:128, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“I hate every false way” means he despised all forms of false
doctrine. Today, we see false methods of spirituality in cults, tongues,
neo-orthodoxy, neo-evangelism, etc. How did he get that way? He learned the
Word of God. He had a full prospective of the plan of God from the Word of God.
Bible doctrine will whip, beat up, and neutralize every false doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Pe File - The Mouth of God, His Word</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew letter Pe represents a mouth. Here, it
represents the mouth of God whereby He speaks to us through His written Word
communicated to us through the pastor-teacher. This is speaking to the
individual under pressure circumstances. He in turn communicates to others.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:129, “Your testimonies” refers to Old
Testament doctrine regarding the person of Jesus Christ as well as His work on
the Cross. Jesus Christ is revealed by the titles of God in the Old Testament.
Jehovah refers to Jesus Christ more than it does to God the Father, such as in Genesis
15:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Pe. Your testimonies are wonderful; Therefore my soul
observes them.&quot;  (Psalms 119:129, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then he believed in the LORD; and He reckoned it to him
as righteousness.&quot;  (Genesis 15:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Are wonderful” means that they sustained him mentally
with a relaxed mental attitude. They sustained his soul and kept him out of
emotional revolt. “Therefore my soul observes them” means that Bible doctrine
in the right lobe of the soul guards the soul. This gives spiritual alertness
and discernment for impact living.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is revealed by historical and prophetical
passages as well. Isaiah 7:14 reveals the Virgin Birth. Isaiah 9:6-8 and Isaiah
58 present Jesus Christ from the time of His virgin birth to the Second Advent.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign:
Behold, a virgin will be with child and bear a son, and she will call His name
Immanuel.&quot;  (Isaiah 7:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to
us; And the government will rest on His shoulders; And His name will be called
Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace. There will be
no end to the increase of His government or of peace, On the throne of David
and over his kingdom, To establish it and to uphold it with justice and
righteousness From then on and forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will
accomplish this. The Lord sends a message against Jacob, And it falls on
Israel.&quot;  (Isaiah 9:6-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is revealed by Christophanies, primarily the
Angel of Jehovah. Sometimes He appeared in the form of a man. In this way, He
appeared in the tent of Abram and wrestled with Jacob. Jesus Christ was also revealed
as the Shekinah Glory in the tabernacle and in the temple. Jesus Christ was
revealed through inanimate manifestations such as the burning bush, the
articles of furniture, and the structure of the tabernacle. See category on <a
href="#_Theophanies_of_Jesus">Theophanies of Jesus Christ</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:130, “The unfolding of Your words gives
light” refers to the grace apparatus for perception. “Gives light” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>בּין</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(bı̂yn)
and refers to <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the soul.
“Light” is illumination and animation. This is the reflected glory of the edification
complex of the soul. We reflect the glory of God.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The unfolding of Your words gives light; It gives
understanding to the simple.&quot;  (Psalms 119:130, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“It gives understanding to the simple” is a very strong
statement and means stupid. This refers to any believer minus a spiritual IQ or
lacking any Bible doctrine in the right lobe of their soul. Spiritual IQ is not
dependent on human IQ. It depends only on the enabling power of the Holy Spirit
that makes the grace apparatus for perception operational. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:131, “I opened my mouth wide and panted”
refers to the desire for air. This is the intake and application of Bible
doctrine – a crash programing in taking in Bible doctrine and living in the
Word.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I opened my mouth wide and panted, For I longed for Your
commandments.&quot;  (Psalms 119:131, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“For I longed for Your commandments” means he had a
tremendous desire for Bible doctrine, an insatiable desire, a desire that
excluded anything else in life. This is like the desire that you have for your
right man or right woman. This is a concentration principle. This verse
expresses maximum positive volition towards Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:132, “Turn to me and be gracious to me”
means literally, “turn me on.” Give me a love for Bible doctrine. He was asking
for the Lord to grace him out.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Turn to me and be gracious to me, After Your manner with
those who love Your name.&quot;  (Psalms 119:132, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“After Your manner with those who love Your name” means
that he understood that it was fair for God to provide grace on the 17th day of
the march because God is the God of grace. He was appealing to the essence of
God. There is no magic formula here. Billions of years ago in Eternity Past,
God provided in His decrees for every need you will ever have. “Love” here is
rapport love, returning his love, the capacity to love God. God is free to love
believers because of the Cross.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:133, “Establish my footsteps in Your word”
means to stabilize his steps, give him the strength to get up and walk today.
Give his steps strength. Firm up his steps so he can walk. Why? He was the
communicator of Bible doctrine in the slave line. The fact that he got up and
moved is a testimony to his Bible class. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Establish my footsteps in Your word, And do not let any
iniquity have dominion over me.&quot;  (Psalms 119:133, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“And do not let any iniquity have dominion over me” means
to not let his old sin nature have dominion over him. He may get out of
fellowship and get mad and punch someone in the nose. Have you ever been so mad
you would fight anyone anywhere anytime? He could try to whip the whole
Chaldean army or communicate Bible doctrine. “Do not let the emptiness of the old
sin nature dominate me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:134, “Redeem me from the oppression of man”
means he was not praying to get out of the chain gang. He was praying to be
delivered out of the danger that comes with oppression and the mental attitude
sins that could eliminate his ministry like hatred and bitterness. “That I may
keep Your precepts” means to apply categorical Bible doctrine to life’s
situations and problems. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Redeem me from the oppression of man, That I may keep
Your precepts.&quot;  (Psalms 119:134, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:135, “Make Your face shine upon Your
servant” refers to the blessings of God's grace being transferred to him. He
wanted to see what God's plan had for him to do every day of his life. “And
teach me Your statutes” means he wanted to learn Bible doctrine so he could
communicate it to the other prisoners.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Make Your face shine upon Your servant, And teach me Your
statutes.&quot;  (Psalms 119:135, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:136, “My eyes shed streams of water” means
he was not crying because of his torture and pain even though he was really
abused on this day. He was primarily crying because of negative volition of
those around him. “Because they do not keep Your law” refers to the greatest
problem the communicator of Bible doctrine can face – negative volition.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;My eyes shed streams of water, Because they do not keep
Your law.&quot;  (Psalms 119:136, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><a name="_Maximum_Adversity,_Believer’s_2"></a><b>Tsadhe
File - Divine Righteousness and Divine Good</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew letter Tsadhe represents a sickle or a reaping
hook. This pictures God’s judgment based on God’s righteousness. This is a
dissertation on divine righteousness and divine good.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:137, “Righteous” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>צדּיק</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(tsaddı̂yq)
and means just, lawful, righteous. This is only one characteristic of God's
essence. The difference between relative righteousness (-R) and God's perfect
absolute righteousness (+R) is illustrated by human good versus divine good.
His +R and His perfect absolute justice were satisfied at the Cross through the
work of Christ and are together called Holiness in Scripture.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Tsadhe. Righteous are You, O LORD, And upright are Your
judgments.&quot;  (Psalms 119:137, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Since they have been satisfied on the Cross, God's love
can be turned toward believers and not be not inconsistent with His perfect
righteousness and justice. “Upright are Your judgments” means God's justice is perfectly
fair. It was not unfair that he was on the death march. The testing was good
for him. It was good, so to speak, to bear the yoke in his youth. Rom. 8:28.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And we know that God causes all things to work together
for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His
purpose.&quot;  (Romans 8:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:138, “You have commanded” refers to
obedience to the person of Jesus Christ. “Your testimonies” refers to the Old
Testament Bible doctrine resulting in occupation with the person of Christ.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;You have commanded Your testimonies in righteousness And
exceeding faithfulness.&quot;  (Psalms 119:138, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“In righteousness” means God's holiness is absolute good
and therefore fair. “And exceeding faithfulness” refers to God's perfect
faithfulness in all of His Word and His promises. God doesn’t discipline us in
accordance with His Holiness. He administers divine discipline to His believers
from His love. He is our Father and we are His children. Discipline to meant to
correct those that He loves. Heb. 12:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;FOR THOSE WHOM THE LORD LOVES HE DISCIPLINES, AND HE
SCOURGES EVERY SON WHOM HE RECEIVES.&quot;&quot;  (Hebrews 12:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Faithfulness is God’s grace and God’s plan which are both
greater than our failures. God has never failed us. God has stated in writing
His faithfulness. This was what he thought when he got up and struggled through
each day of the death march.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:139, “My zeal has consumed me” refers a
word here for understanding doctrine and it giving you a burst of spiritual
adrenalin to meet the needs of the day which will be demanding. He understood
the essence of God. He understood the faithfulness of God. He understood the
absolute righteousness and fairness of God. Therefore, he had no mental
attitude sins. He did not feel sorry for himself.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;My zeal has consumed me, Because my adversaries have
forgotten Your words.&quot;  (Psalms 119:139, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Zeal” refers to his inner resources, extra spiritual
motivation to meet a very demanding day. This is in the area of psychosomatics.
We may be exhausted, tired, worn-out, shot, drained, and then Bible doctrine
hits the soul and you are revived.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In a pastor-teacher, there may be times when he has a
certain tiredness to communicate as he should. This situation evokes dependence
on the Lord because a pastor-teacher has no time to be sick. “Consumed” means saturating
someone to the point of making them move. Energy from a spiritual source
motivates him.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“My adversaries have forgotten Your words” means that on
this day of the march, the Babylonian soldiers were completely out of it
because they had debauched too much the night before. Whereas, he was
strengthened and ready to go. In contrast, the soldiers as the victors were dragging
along.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:140, “Your word is very pure” refers to
Bible doctrine as being a purifier or a refiner of the soul.  Testing of the
Bible doctrine in your soul is much better for you than prosperity. That is why
the Bible doctrine in your edification complex of the soul is always being
tested so that you will grow spiritually. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Your word is very pure, Therefore Your servant loves
it.&quot;  (Psalms 119:140, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Growing spiritually means you are depending more on God’s
grace resources to solve life’s problems and situations. Prosperity cannot be
handled unless you are spiritually mature. Even then it can be dangerous. “Therefore
Your servant loves it” means he appreciated what testing did for his soul.
Prov. 8:17-19.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;I love those who love me; And those who diligently
seek me will find me. &quot;Riches and honor are with me, Enduring wealth and
righteousness. &quot;My fruit is better than gold, even pure gold, And my yield
better than choicest silver.&quot;  (Proverbs 8:17-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 8:17-19, “I” represents Bible doctrine or
divine wisdom. “I (divine wisdom) love those who love me (divine wisdom) and
those that seek me early (in youth) shall find me.” “Riches (material
prosperity) and honor (human fame) are with me, durable riches (glamourous
living) and righteousness (spiritual prosperity). If someone has a low human IQ,
they can learn Bible doctrine as well as anyone. The equipment is positive
volition on your part, the rest are the mechanics of grace.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 8:19, “My fruit (production) is better than
gold, even pure gold and my revenue (gain) than choice silver.” Look what a
trial did in the life of the man in Matthew 4:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But He answered and said, &quot;It is written, 'MAN SHALL
NOT LIVE ON BREAD ALONE, BUT ON EVERY WORD THAT PROCEEDS OUT OF THE MOUTH OF
GOD.'&quot;&quot;  (Matthew 4:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:141, “I am small and despised” means he was
young and hated, the object of contempt. “Yet I do not forget Your precepts”
means he did not forget the categorical Bible doctrine taught to him in the
right lobe of his soul, ready for application. Provided he had Bible doctrine
and was willing to apply it, the testing was of great benefit to him. Lam.
3:27.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I am small and despised, Yet I do not forget Your
precepts.&quot;  (Psalms 119:141, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;It is good for a man that he should bear The yoke in his
youth.&quot;  (Lamentations 3:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:142, “Your righteousness is an everlasting
righteousness” refers to the essence of God. God is always absolute good. When God
planned his life, He planned it in eternity past. “Your law is truth” means he
had an absolute anchor.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Your righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, And
Your law is truth.&quot;  (Psalms 119:142, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:143, “Trouble and anguish have come upon
me” means they have grabbed him. This is a very severe trial and really rough.
Trouble has embraced him and encircled him. “Yet Your commandments are my
delight” means he still had a passion for Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Trouble and anguish have come upon me, Yet Your
commandments are my delight.&quot;  (Psalms 119:143, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:144, “Your testimonies are righteous
forever” refers to the immutability of God. “Give me understanding that I may
live” means cause me to understand doctrine and I will be refreshed.” Look at
the impact one stabilized believer can have. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Your testimonies are righteous forever; Give me
understanding that I may live.&quot;  (Psalms 119:144, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Qoph File – Problems With the Subconscious </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew letter Qoph represents the back of the head or
the subconscious. The subconscious can give you problems such as a guilt
complex, an inferiority complex, a superiority complex and fears.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:145, “I cried with all my heart” means he was
in a truly helpless and hopeless situation. He was struggling to stay in
fellowship and even tempted to commit suicide. In the right lobe of his soul in
the frame of reference and memory center he not only recalled the horrors of
the march, but Bible doctrine as well. In his conscience and spiritual norms
and standards, depression was knocking for an entrance. There was pressure to
reject divine norms and standards and succumb to the pressure. He was
considering human viewpoint thinking.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Qoph. I cried with all my heart; answer me, O LORD! I
will observe Your statutes.&quot;  (Psalms 119:145, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Answer me, O Lord!” means he sensed that he was
slipping. “I will observe Your statutes” refers to Bible doctrine presented
categorically. Nebuchadnezzar had a tremendous appreciation for Jeremiah.
Jeremiah was seated and watched the chain gang go by, the flower of the youth
of Israel. As they went by, he spoke to them in Lamentations. Based on some of
the things that were said from the examination of the Hebrew, this was as close
as he came to cracking up. In Lamentations 3:21, “I have hope” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>יחל</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(yâchal)
and is used of the spiritual frame of reference under extreme pressure.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;This I recall to my mind, Therefore I have hope.&quot; 
(Lamentations 3:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Lamentations 3:22-23, “The Lord’s lovingkindnesses
indeed never cease” means His grace, His provision never ceases. They are new
every morning. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The LORD'S lovingkindnesses indeed never cease, For His
compassions never fail. They are new every morning; Great is Your
faithfulness.&quot;  (Lamentations 3:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Lamentations 3:24-25, “my portion” is the grace
apparatus for perception. I trust in Him in the midst of pressure. The Bible
doctrine in the soul carried him through it. This is Jeremiah’s prophecy of the
rise of a renewed nation. The message was there to sustain.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;The LORD is my portion,&quot; says my soul,
&quot;Therefore I have hope in Him.&quot; The LORD is good to those who wait
for Him, To the person who seeks Him.&quot;  (Lamentations 3:24-25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:146, “I cried to You” means the 19th day
was very crucial. He was struggling to keep his sanity. Nightmares came from his
subconscious and he would wake up in horror. You will need less sleep as the
subconscious empties. Four hours of sound sleep is worth eight hours of
restless sleep.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I cried to You; save me And I shall keep Your
testimonies.&quot;  (Psalms 119:146, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Save me” is the hiphil imperative of <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>ישׁע</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(yâsha‛)
and means cause me to be delivered and the cry was coming from his subconscious.
“Your testimonies” refers to Bible doctrine pertaining to the person and work
of Jesus Christ - Levitical offerings, the tabernacle, the priesthood, the holy
days. This is occupation with Christ under the most difficult of situations.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:147, “I rise before dawn” is the piel
intensive of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>קדם</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(qâdam) and means to anticipate or go up early. “And
cry for help” was his intense prayer for God's deliverance from the horrors
around him. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I rise before dawn and cry for help; I wait for Your
words.&quot;  (Psalms 119:147, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“I wait for Your words” means to have faith under maximum
pressure. Faith is a system of perception and a system of perception involves
thinking. Thinking involves vocabulary and that vocabulary must involve divine
viewpoint vocabulary which can be used.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Experiences that have been particularly extreme will
occasionally come back to people to bother them, for example, a woman who has
been raped. The sexual abuse problem could have haunted him the rest of his
life, but Bible doctrine in his soul and divine viewpoint thinking took care of
it. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:148, “My eyes anticipate the night watches”
means he was anticipating a good night’s sleep. The night before had exhausted
him and he was shot. “That I may meditate on Your word” says he was looking
forward to thinking about Bible doctrine. Not only did he anticipate sleep, but
thinking about Bible doctrine and about the Lord</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;My eyes anticipate the night watches, That I may meditate
on Your word.&quot;  (Psalms 119:148, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Psalms 119:149 involves him having a terrible experience.
“Hear my voice according to Your lovingkindness” is intense prayer for his
extreme situation and abuse. Billions of years ago, God knew that he would face
these abuses. Therefore, the Lord made provision for that extreme adversity.
But to meet that adversity, this young man needed to utilize Bible doctrine and
by doing so stay in fellowship, otherwise his life would be filled with
distortions and other problems. “Revive me” means to refresh based on the
divine wisdom in his soul.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Hear my voice according to Your lovingkindness; Revive
me, O LORD, according to Your ordinances.&quot;  (Psalms 119:149, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:150, “wickedness” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>זמּה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(zimmâh) and means
wicked schemes, lewd acts and refers to all of the rape, torture and sexual
abuse that this young man had going on all around him. The soldiers are
advancing to attack the children and the other prisoners on the death march.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Those who follow after wickedness draw near; They are far
from Your law.&quot;  (Psalms 119:150, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Leviticus 18:17, “lewdness” is also <i>zimmâh</i>. When
the Bible speaks about a subject, it ought to be translated and taught
accurately. We know from this verse that <i>zimmâh</i> is related to abnormal
and perverted sexual activity. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;'You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and of
her daughter, nor shall you take her son's daughter or her daughter's daughter,
to uncover her nakedness; they are blood relatives. It is lewdness.&quot; 
(Leviticus 18:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 10:23, “wickedness” is also <i>zimmâh</i> and
is a sport to a degenerate fool. These are abnormal and perverted activities. “And
so is wisdom to a man of understanding” means a man of understanding is one
with Bible doctrine in his soul and has wisdom regarding sexual abuse matters.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Doing wickedness is like sport to a fool, And so is
wisdom to a man of understanding.&quot;  (Proverbs 10:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This boy had a sexual catastrophe. He was attacked by
males. Without his consent he was sexually abused that night. This could have
scarred him for life, destroyed him, ruined him, but it didn’t. You do not have
to be ruined by these things. The Bible doctrine in your soul and God’s grace
resources will enable you to continue and handle the situation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ezekiel 22:9-11, “they have committed acts of lewdness”
is again <i>zimmâh</i> and means lewdness with evil intent, homosexual
activities, sexual abuse, and perversion. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Slanderous men have been in you for the purpose of
shedding blood, and in you they have eaten at the mountain shrines. In your
midst they have committed acts of lewdness. &quot;In you they have uncovered
their fathers' nakedness; in you they have humbled her who was unclean in her
menstrual impurity. &quot;One has committed abomination with his neighbor's
wife and another has lewdly defiled his daughter-in-law. And another in you has
humbled his sister, his father's daughter.&quot;  (Ezekiel 22:9-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Jeremiah 11:15, “she has done many vile deeds” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL>מזמּה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(mezimmâh) and
refers to homosexuals worshiping in the house of the Lord.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;What right has My beloved in My house When she has
done many vile deeds? Can the sacrificial flesh take away from you your
disaster, So that you can rejoice?&quot;&quot;  (Jeremiah 11:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:151, “You are near, O Lord” is what he was
thinking when he was being abused. “Your commandments are truth” means that
divine viewpoint thinking kept him sane. His body was abused, but his soul was
kept intact. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;You are near, O LORD, And all Your commandments are
truth.&quot;  (Psalms 119:151, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:152, “Of old I have known from Your
testimonies” means he understood the doctrine of divine decrees and he was
occupied with Jesus Christ. Bible doctrine is greater than any disaster in
life. Bible doctrine handles the problems of the subconscious just as it handles
the problems of consciousness. If you are alive when the smoke clears, you will
have an unbelievable spiritual life and ministry.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Of old I have known from Your testimonies That You have
founded them forever.&quot;  (Psalms 119:152, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is a unique file and an honest file. When you face
your crisis, your <i>zimmâh</i> pressure, you too can always be assured that
doctrine can take care of every pressure.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Resh File – Thinking with Divine Viewpoint </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew letter Resh represents the head and refers to
what you think, the mentality. This time, the emphasis is on the right lobe of
the soul where Bible doctrine resides and results in divine viewpoint thinking.
The Word of God reveals for our total understanding why God destroys a nation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:153, “Look upon my affliction” means to
observe what is going on. He was still applying the doctrine of God’s plan.
“Affliction” is <i>zimmâh</i> type abuse. “And rescue me” is the piel
imperative of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>חָלַץ</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(chalats) and means to rescue, to remove the situation,
to equalize, to neutralize this terrible situation. He prays intensively on the
basis of the Word of God and the character of God.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Resh. Look upon my affliction and rescue me, For I do not
forget Your law.&quot;  (Psalms 119:153, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:154, “Plead my cause and redeem me” means
to defend my cause and deliver me from the situation. He wished to be able to
move, to teach Bible doctrine even though each night was a nightmare.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Plead my cause and redeem me; Revive me according to Your
word.&quot;  (Psalms 119:154, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Revive me” is the piel imperative of <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>חָיָה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (chayah) and means to
revive, to refresh. This is a grace given refreshment in the midst of intense pressure.
This is not the refreshment of taking a hot bath or shower. This is not the
refreshment of sitting back on a recliner and sipping your favorite beverage.
This is not the refreshment of relaxing during some leisure time activity. Bible
doctrine is the basis of the refreshment.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:155, “Salvation is far from the wicked”
means they are negative to Bible doctrine and they are negative to freedom.
These soldiers are in soul slavery. He watched these animals at work. The
slaves got stronger and the Chaldeans got weaker. The Chaldeans could not stand
power. They had too much power. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Salvation is far from the wicked, For they do not seek
Your statutes.&quot;  (Psalms 119:155, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>From divine viewpoint, one nation is going down and one
nation is going up. “For they do not seek Your statutes” is the qal perfect of <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>דּרשׁ</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(dârash)
which is a completed action. A nation cannot endure without Bible doctrine. Hosea
4:5 says that when a nation rejects Bible doctrine, it destroys itself. When he
woke up in the morning he knew these people were on the way out as a nation.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So you will stumble by day, And the prophet also will
stumble with you by night; And I will destroy your mother.&quot;  (Hosea 4:5,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:156, “Great are Your mercies” refers to
God's acts of grace. They were in slavery, but they had survived. They were
still alive on the 20th day. The bodies had been abused, but the souls were
intact. John 8:32.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Great are Your mercies, O LORD; Revive me according to
Your ordinances.&quot;  (Psalms 119:156, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you
free.&quot;&quot;  (John 8:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This young man understood why Israel was wiped out under
the fifth cycle of discipline. Where had he learn that? From Jeremiah. When a
nation with light becomes depraved, it is conquered by a more depraved nation. God
makes a depraved nation eat their depravity. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The loose women get raped. The slack husbands who beat
their wives when they are drunk are beaten by drunks who are their conquerors,
etc. However, one day this young man will walk back over the graves of the
Chaldeans. Where are the Chaldeans today? They have been gone for 2,500 years.
Where are the Jews today? They are still around because that young man became
the teacher of young men who were positive to Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Resh file is a total understanding of why God
destroys a nation. Every nation in history that was destroyed, destroyed itself
first. Teenagers who get Bible doctrine are the hope of our nation. “Revive me
according to Your ordinances” refers to the principle of propitiation. He was
appealing to the essence of God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:157, “Many are my persecutors and my
adversaries” means he hads a lot of people against him, yet he was still
occupied with Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Many are my persecutors and my adversaries, Yet I do not
turn aside from Your testimonies.&quot;  (Psalms 119:157, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:158, “I behold the treacherous” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>בּגד</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(bâgad)
and refers to a person guilty of rape and violence. Lots of things can make you
sick. Bible doctrine helps you pick up and move on. “And loathe them” means he
was so sick he had to vomit.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I behold the treacherous and loathe them, Because they do
not keep Your word.&quot;  (Psalms 119:158, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:159, “Consider how love Your precepts”
means he loved Bible doctrine, the Word of God. “Revive me, O LORD, according
to Your lovingkindness” means refresh me Lord according to your living grace in
action.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Consider how I love Your precepts; Revive me, O LORD,
according to Your lovingkindness.&quot;  (Psalms 119:159, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:160, “The sum of your word is truth” says
that the essence of God's Word is Bible doctrine. He was hooked into the
eternal loving God.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The sum of Your word is truth, And every one of Your
righteous ordinances is everlasting.&quot;  (Psalms 119:160, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Shin File – Daily learning the Word of God</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew letter Shin represents a tooth and is pronounced
“seen or sheen.” This introduces the principle of learning the Word of God
every day. This file will emphasize constant intake of Bible doctrine. Matt.
4:4. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But He answered and said, &quot;It is written, 'MAN SHALL
NOT LIVE ON BREAD ALONE, BUT ON EVERY WORD THAT PROCEEDS OUT OF THE MOUTH OF
GOD.'&quot;&quot;  (Matthew 4:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The death march was about over. Those who had survived had
done so because of God's grace provision and the Bible doctrine in their souls.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:161, “Princes” are the Babylonian nobility.
Apparently, there were more than soldiers on this death march. When the
nobility of a land become decadent, it is indicative that most the people of
the land are also decadent. The exception is always a faithful remnant of
positive believers. Such decadent nations will go out under the fifth cycle of
discipline if the decadence continues. Zech. 1:15. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Shin. Princes persecute me without cause, But my heart
stands in awe of Your words.&quot;  (Psalms 119:161, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;But I am very angry with the nations who are at
ease; for while I was only a little angry, they furthered the
disaster.&quot;&quot;  (Zechariah 1:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Persecute me without cause” means there is never an
excuse for abuse of power. “But my heart stands in awe” is <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>פּחד</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(pâchad)
and refers to the dominant soul of this young person and that he was satisfied
and occupied with the Word of God. He was absolutely fascinated with the
ability of God’s Word to carry him through the most awful difficulties. His
soul stayed intact. He made decisions all along the way to stick with the Word.
What does Bible doctrine mean to you?</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:162, his testimony continues on what the
Word meant to him over the past three weeks. “I rejoice at Your Word” refers to
his inner happiness from the Bible doctrine in his soul and God's grace
provision. “As one who finds great spoil” refers to great profit, great gain,
and connotes a gift. Bible doctrine gives you a real zest for living.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I rejoice at Your word, As one who finds great
spoil.&quot;  (Psalms 119:162, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This young man was blessed by keeping his divine
viewpoint thinking under the most extreme circumstances. Get Bible doctrine in
the right lobe of your soul. In Proverbs 8:32-33, “Heed instruction and be
wise, And do not neglect it.” Don’t go negative.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Now therefore, O sons, listen to me, For blessed
are they who keep my ways. &quot;Heed instruction and be wise, And do not
neglect it.&quot;  (Proverbs 8:32-33, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 8:34, “Watching daily at my gates, Waiting at
my doorposts” means to go where Bible doctrine is taught daily.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Blessed is the man who listens to me, Watching
daily at my gates, Waiting at my doorposts.&quot;  (Proverbs 8:34, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:163, “I hate and despise falsehood” is
referring to false doctrine. “But I love Your law” is the qal perfect and means
to keep on loving Bible doctrine. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I hate and despise falsehood, But I love Your law.&quot; 
(Psalms 119:163, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:164, “Seven time a day I praise You” is in
the past tense. He did this before the fall of Jerusalem. You can’t go to Bible
class too much.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Seven times a day I praise You, Because of Your righteous
ordinances.&quot;  (Psalms 119:164, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>People may say that the pastor puts too much emphasis on
the military. They may say that he makes people dependent upon him. There are always
other things that must be done that are given a higher priority than going to Bible
class and learning the Word of God and what God has planned for your life.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is what many had done while living in Jerusalem.
Bible doctrine was not very important to them. When they needed spiritual
strength, they had nothing. These people died on the death march. The positive
believers who ignored the mockery from others negative to Bible doctrine lived
through the death march. Live up to the light you have. You cannot get too much
Bible doctrine into your soul. You can never gain too much divine wisdom. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:165, “great peace” is inner happiness plus
doctrine resulting in a relaxed mental attitude. This is inner soul stability.
“Nothing causes them to stumble” in the Hebrew says, “There is not a stumbling
block to them.” That is, to those who have great peace.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Those who love Your law have great peace, And nothing
causes them to stumble.&quot;  (Psalms 119:165, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A stumbling block is a person who is obnoxious to you.
Also, your own carnal action can make you a stumbling block to others. When you
have “great peace” people don’t get you down. You take doctrine inside so that
no person can get you down.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:166, “I hope for Your salvation, O Lord” is
the piel perfect and is saying that he knew when this thing started that he
would be delivered. Why? Bible doctrine in his soul. Isaiah 54:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I hope for Your salvation, O LORD, And do Your
commandments.&quot;  (Psalms 119:166, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;No weapon that is formed against you will prosper;
And every tongue that accuses you in judgment you will condemn. This is the
heritage of the servants of the LORD, And their vindication is from Me,&quot;
declares the LORD.&quot;  (Isaiah 54:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Salvation” is physical deliverance. “I do Your
commandments” is the perfect tense of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>עָשָׂה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(asah) and means to
make something out of something. This means to make a relaxed mental attitude
out of Bible doctrine. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:167, “My soul keeps Your testimonies” means
his soul is on guard for Bible doctrine. He had a healthy soul. “And I love
them exceedingly” refers to his rapport love with the Word. This unpleasant
experience hadn’t made him go negative. He was saying he loved the Word of God
to the maximum, to the utmost limit of his capacity.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;My soul keeps Your testimonies, And I love them
exceedingly.&quot;  (Psalms 119:167, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:168, “I keep Your precepts and Your
testimonies” means he had stayed in fellowship. “For all my ways are before You”
says that he was a young man and still had his life before him. He knew he was
going to survive and continue to grow to spiritual maturity. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I keep Your precepts and Your testimonies, For all my
ways are before You.&quot;  (Psalms 119:168, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Tav File - The Faithfulness of God</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew letter Tav represents a signature. Instead of
saying “Make your mark,” they would say “Make your tav” if he couldn’t write.
The significance is that this will close out the death march and he was still
around to sign his name all from the faithfulness of God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:169, “Let my cry come before You, O Lord”
means to let my cry (under pressure) come near before you. He was saying to let
his call come before the throne of grace. He was going to pray.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Tav. Let my cry come before You, O LORD; Give me
understanding according to Your word.&quot;  (Psalms 119:169, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Give me understanding according to your Word” is the hiphil
stem (perfect) of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>בּין</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(bı̂yn). He was saying, “Cause me to evaluate my
experience biblically. I know I can. I will be able to.” No past disaster could
hold him down or give him a guilt complex, it could only work together for
good.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is no difficulty, heartache or frustration or
catastrophe in your life that should ever make you bitter or that should upset
you in the future. This was a relaxed, wonderful person emerging from the pit
of pressure and disaster.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:170, “Let my supplication come before You”
is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>תּחנּה</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(techinnâh) and is not the ordinary word for prayer
which is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>קָנָה</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(qânâh).  This means to use prayer as an expression of
grace or orientation to grace. This is not begging. This is letting your
prayer, oriented to grace, come before God the Father.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Let my supplication come before You; Deliver me according
to Your word.&quot;  (Psalms 119:170, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Deliver me according to Your word” is the hiphil and
means to cause me to be physically delivered. He wants to be rescued, not
because he was anything, but because God’s Word is true. The battle was the
Lord’s, not his. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:171, “Let my lips utter praise” means to be
caused to utter or gush out praise. He anticipated a long life after
deliverance from slavery. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Let my lips utter praise, For You teach me Your
statutes.&quot;  (Psalms 119:171, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“For You teach me Your statutes” refers to categories of
Bible doctrine. In other words, there were some things he had yet to learn and
after he had learned them, he was going to live a normal, wonderful, God-oriented
life.  He was not going to go through life carrying the scars of this disaster.
There is too much emphasis today on bad background or bad experiences. They
forget Romans 8:28. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And we know that God causes all things to work together
for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His
purpose.&quot;  (Romans 8:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:172, “Let my tongue sing of Your word”
means that as long as he lived, he would teach Bible doctrine. He was really
grace oriented. His tongue was dedicated to the communication of the Word of
God.  In the New Testament Greek, three words carry similar meaning. Some of it
will be λαλέω (laleō) which means to speak, to talk, some will be παρακαλέω
(parakaleō) which means to exhort, to comfort, to encourage, to instruct, and some
will be διδάσκω (didaskō) which means to teach.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Let my tongue sing of Your word, For all Your
commandments are righteousness.&quot;  (Psalms 119:172, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“For all Your commandments are righteousness” means all
your commandments are perfection, the plan of God is perfect and must be
communicated to believers. There is nothing wrong with the plan of God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:173, “Let Your hand be ready to help me”
mean he was talking about teaching the Word of God. He needed the facility of
communication. “For I have chosen Your precepts” means he had chosen for his
lifetime to teach Bible doctrine categorically. He wanted to make Bible
doctrine and grace clear to others who would listen. Isaiah 28:10; Isaiah
28:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Let Your hand be ready to help me, For I have chosen Your
precepts.&quot;  (Psalms 119:173, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;For He says, 'Order on order, order on order, Line
on line, line on line, A little here, a little there.'&quot;&quot;  (Isaiah
28:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So the word of the LORD to them will be, &quot;Order on
order, order on order, Line on line, line on line, A little here, a little
there,&quot; That they may go and stumble backward, be broken, snared and taken
captive.&quot;  (Isaiah 28:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:174, “I long for Your salvation” shows that
he was human like anyone else. This was the human side now. He was normal. He
didn’t need tranquilizers, drugs, or alcohol. What made the difference was the
utilization of Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I long for Your salvation, O LORD, And Your law is my
delight.&quot;  (Psalms 119:174, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Your law is my delight” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שׁעשׁע</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(sha‛shûa‛)
and means delight, pleasure. When this word is used, it means Bible doctrine was
his life and everything else was incidental. This was his attitude toward
preparation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:175 are the results of “delight.” The
results are to “let my soul live” and means to let his soul be refreshed. “That
it may praise You, And let Your ordinances help me” means that God’s spiritual
freedom enables the believer to grow spiritually from God's grace resources
gained from Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the soul.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Let my soul live that it may praise You, And let Your
ordinances help me.&quot;  (Psalms 119:175, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:176,  “I have gone astray like a lost
sheep” means he was normal and had failed at times, but he had no illusions
about himself and he knew he was far from perfect. Through it all, the Lord had
brought back the sheep. They survived. Bible doctrine always brings you back to
the grace and plan of God.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek Your servant,
For I do not forget Your commandments.&quot;  (Psalms 119:176, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Seek Your servant” is an imperative, a command. He was
praying that God would look after him and when he failed, bring him back into
line no matter what it took.  He was asking for grace for the rest of his life.
He was saying to God that if He looked after him, that he would never forget Bible
doctrine. Keep me in line and I’ll keep cranking out the Word.</p>
