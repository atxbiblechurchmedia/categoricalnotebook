<h2><a name="_D-Love"></a><a name="_Love"></a>Love</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Love is a strong feeling of personal affection and
concern toward another. Love is the embodiment of soul function and
concentration toward someone. Love is devotion after thought, esteem, and
loyalty to the object of love. Attraction is merely a preliminary to love. Love
excludes the object of that love from everyone else into a close intimate
relationship. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Love can be a feeling of devotion or adoration toward
God. Love can arise from kinship or close friendship. Love can be a feeling of
warm personal attachment or deep affection, as for a parent, child, or friend. Love
can be a profoundly tender, passionate affection for another person. Love can
be a sexual attraction leading to intense desire and sexual passion.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Man is capable of love toward three objects: God, other
people, and things. However, man’s concepts and capacities for love are as
variable as there are people on earth. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer’s love is applied in three areas - toward
God, toward the opposite sex, and toward others in friendship. The unbeliever
can also love in all three areas. The source of the unbeliever’s love is from
the left lobe of the mentality of their soul and from their areas of strength
in the old sin nature. There is nothing spiritual about the unbeliever’s love.
When the believer is not filled with the Holy Spirit, the love produced is
human love. The believer imitates the unbeliever and human good is not
acceptable to God. Rom. 8:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and those who are in the flesh cannot please God.” (Romans
8:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Thus, the love produced by the believer is a greater love
because it is produced by the filling of the Holy Spirit and coupled with <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine in the believer’s soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Greek Words for Love</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i><u>Agape - Agapao</u></i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Greek word <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>γα</span>́<span
lang=EL>πη</span> (agapē) is the noun form of the word, the verb form being <i>agapao</i>.
<i>Agapao</i> love is produced by the filling of the Holy Spirit in the
mentality of the soul only. When this love is produced, there is absence of
mental attitude sins. It also respects the volition of individuals and also
respects others’ privacy and property.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Agapao</i> love is unconditional and in accordance
with the believer’s own strength of character and is based on <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine resident in our souls. This type of unconditional mental
attitude love is the basis of our peace, unity, acceptance, and forgiveness of
fellow believers. <i>Agapao</i> love is commanded toward God and all believers.
Gal. 5:22-23; Rom. 5:5; 1 John 4:7-10. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience,
kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things
there is no law.” (Galatians 5:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been
poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.”
(Romans 5:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God; and
everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. The one who does not love does
not know God, for God is love. By this the love of God was manifested in us,
that God has sent His only begotten Son into the world so that we might live
through Him. In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and
sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins.” (1 John 4:7-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first thing <i>agapao</i> love does through the
filling of the Holy Spirit is to be directed back to God because the believer
is the responder to God's <i>agapao</i> love. There it is given a stability and
power. Then, when applied back to the human race, it has impact. The reason is
this love is from God. You take the attitude of God toward the other believer.
God loves all believers. When you are filled with the Holy Spirit, thus
producing <i>agapao</i> love, you have impact for Christ. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Agapao</i> love is a deep and abiding respect for
another based entirely in your own character and spiritual advance. <i>Agapao</i>
love commands our intentions and directs our daily decisions. <i>Agapao</i>
love is used to describe God’s love for man in John 3:16 and Romans 5:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For God so loved the world, that He gave His only
begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal
life.” (John 3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we
were yet sinners, Christ died for us.” (Romans 5:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Agapao</i> love is used to describe man’s love for God
in Matthew 22:37 and 1 John 2:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He said to him, &quot; 'YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD
WITH ALL YOUR HEART, AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND WITH ALL YOUR MIND.'” (Matthew
22:37, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“but whoever keeps His word, in him the love of God has truly
been perfected. By this we know that we are in Him:” (1 John 2:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Agapao</i> love is used to describe man’s love for his
fellow man in Matthew 22:39 and Romans 13:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;The second is like it, 'YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS
YOURSELF.'” (Matthew 22:39, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the
fulfillment of the law.” (Romans 13:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Agapao</i> love is used to describe strong personal
desires for some things and is used in a negative sense in John 3:19 and John 12:43.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;This is the judgment, that the Light has come into the
world, and men loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were
evil.” (John 3:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“for they loved the approval of men rather than the approval of
God.” (John 12:43, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i><u>Philos - Phileo</u></i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Greek word <span lang=EL>φι</span>́<span lang=EL>λος</span>
(philos) is the noun form of the word, the verb form being <span lang=EL>φιλε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span><span lang=EL> </span>(phileō). <i>Phileo</i> love is intimate
and personal affection and preference toward other people or things that we may
have. <i>Phileo</i> love is produced by the believer who is filled of the Holy
Spirit and is applying <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine from the right lobe of
their soul. This is total soul love. The source of <i>phileo</i> love is the
application of Bible doctrine to the believer’s relationships with others.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is a difference between <i>agapao</i> and <i>phileo</i>.
<i>Agapao</i> is specialized, unconditional, and always mental and depends on
the filling of the Holy Spirit. <i>Phileo</i> love is general, personal, and
total soul love that comes through a knowledge of Bible doctrine to certain
members of the human race and the Godhead. John 20:15-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Jesus said to her, &quot;Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are
you seeking?&quot; Supposing Him to be the gardener, she said to Him,
&quot;Sir, if you have carried Him away, tell me where you have laid Him, and I
will take Him away.&quot; Jesus said to her, &quot;Mary!&quot; She turned and
said to Him in Hebrew, &quot;Rabboni!&quot; (which means, Teacher). Jesus said
to her, &quot;Stop clinging to Me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father;
but go to My brethren and say to them, 'I ascend to My Father and your Father,
and My God and your God.'&quot;” (John 20:15-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Phileo</i> love is used to describe man’s love for
others in Matthew 10:37 and Titus 3:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy
of Me; and he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me.”
(Matthew 10:37, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in the
faith. Grace be with you all.” (Titus 3:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Phileo</i> love is used to describe God’s love for God
the Son in John 5:20. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For the Father loves the Son, and shows Him all things
that He Himself is doing; and the Father will show Him greater works than
these, so that you will marvel.” (John 5:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Phileo</i> love is used to describe God the Father’s
love for our Lord’s disciples in John 16:27. </p>

<p class=Verses>“for the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me
and have believed that I came forth from the Father.” (John 16:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Phileo</i> love is used to describe man’s love in a
negative sense for other things in Matthew 6:5 and Revelation 22:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;When you pray, you are not to be like the hypocrites;
for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the street corners so
that they may be seen by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in
full.” (Matthew 6:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Outside are the dogs and the sorcerers and the immoral persons
and the murderers and the idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices
lying.” (Revelation 22:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Phileo</i> love is also used as a compound word <span
lang=EL>φιλαδελφι</span>́<span lang=EL>α</span> (philadelphia) composed of the
“phileo” (love) and “adelphos” (brother). Hence it’s meaning is “brotherly
love” or love for other believers and is found in Romans 12:10, 1 Thessalonians
4:9, Hebrews 13:1, and 1 Peter 1:22. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Be devoted to one another in brotherly love; give preference
to one another in honor;” (Romans 12:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now as to the love of the brethren, you have no need for
anyone to write to you, for you yourselves are taught by God to love one
another;” (1 Thessalonians 4:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Let love of the brethren continue.” (Hebrews 13:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Since you have in obedience to the truth purified your souls
for a sincere love of the brethren, fervently love one another from the heart,”
(1 Peter 1:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i><u>Eros </u></i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The noun form<i> </i><span lang=EL>έρος</span> (eros) is love
is directed toward the opposite sex and refers to passionate, sexual type of love.
This love exists between husband and wife in marriage.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Storgos</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The noun form<i> </i><span lang=EL>στόργος</span>
(storgos) is the relationship love that parents have for their children and
their children toward their parents. Children are not capable of returning this
love until their teens. <i>Storgos</i> is used in a negative sense in Romans
1:31 and 2 Timothy 3:3. </p>

<p class=Verses>“without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful;”
(Romans 1:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“unloving, irreconcilable, malicious gossips, without
self-control, brutal, haters of good,” (2 Timothy 3:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God’s Love for Mankind</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is perfect. God’s love is perfect and absolute.
Therefore, His divine love is perfect. His love is unconditional. In John 3:16,
“loved the world” when used for believers, refers to all believers whether
mature, immature, spiritual, or carnal. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For God so loved the world, that He gave His only
begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal
life.” (John 3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God can love every believer with maximum love regardless
of spiritual status because of positional truth, propitiation, and God’s perfect
attribute of love. Grace depends upon the character of the one initiating the
love. God’s love is maximum after the point of propitiation to every believer.
The believer is in union with Jesus Christ. Therefore, because of propitiation,
God can love the believer with maximum divine love. Eph. 1:6; 1 John 3:2. See
category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/G/God%E2%80%99s%20Love.html">God’s Love</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely
bestowed on us in the Beloved.” (Ephesians 1:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Beloved, now we are children of God, and it has not appeared
as yet what we will be. We know that when He appears, we will be like Him,
because we will see Him just as He is.” (1 John 3:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><a name="_The_Believer’s_Love"></a><b>The Believer’s Love
for God </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>No member of the human race can love God until they come
to the Cross. The unbeliever does not have the equipment to love God. He must
have the Holy Spirit and a human spirit to be able to love God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mankind’s pre-salvation love for God is an attraction
love with a response of positive volition to the Gospel. The positive
unbeliever is attracted to the Savior. John 3:l6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For God so loved the world, that He gave His only
begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal
life.” (John 3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the point of salvation, man’s love for God is a
positional love. When you make a one-time decision to accept Jesus Christ as
your Savior, it is a mental attitude <i>agapao</i> love. This is a mental
attitude love with no Bible doctrine yet in the right lobe of the soul. Rom.
8:28.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And we know that God causes all things to work together for
good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.”
(Romans 8:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer’s post-salvation love for God when they are filled
with the Holy Spirit is <i>agapao</i> love and is a knowing mental attitude
love. It comes from the filling of the Holy Spirit and produces the fruit of
the Holy Spirit. As the believer grows spiritually, soul love or rapport love for
God grows which is <i>phileo</i> love. 1 John 4:19</p>

<p class=Verses>“We love, because He first loved us.” (1 John 4:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are two issues in loving God in the Christian walk.
You must ask yourself whether you are filled with the Holy Spirit (in
fellowship) and whether you consistently learning Bible doctrine through the
grace apparatus for perception and therefore growing spiritually. God is the
initiator. The believer is the responder. Consequently, the believer filled
with the Holy Spirit and growing spiritually begins to reflect the love of the
Father.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If your spiritual life is functioning, you will be
relaxed when thinking about God, being around your spouse, and being around people
in general. The great enemy to proper love response to God is false doctrine,
emotionalism, legalism, and religion. Both legalism and emotionalism disorient
the believer to the grace of God and distort their love toward God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The great hindrance to a personal <i>phileo</i> love
relationship with God, resulting in unconditional <i>agapao</i> love toward
others, is the existence of false doctrine and ignorance of God's Truth. This
ignorance of Bible doctrine is the reason why so many Christians today are
involved in systems of false spirituality such as legalism and emotionalism.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer’s love for God is based spiritual growth.
Therefore, knowledge of Bible doctrine keeps down scar tissue formation on the
soul and erects the edification complex inside the soul composed of <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine or full knowledge. However, when the believer is negative to
doctrine, they have no capacity to love. Persistent negative volition to
doctrine results in scar tissue buildup. 2 Tim. 3:2-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful,
arrogant, revilers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy, unloving,
irreconcilable, malicious gossips, without self-control, brutal, haters of
good, treacherous, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers
of God,” (2 Timothy 3:2-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer negative to Bible doctrine has a frantic
search for happiness. In pursuit of happiness, more scar tissue is produced,
more frustration, and more unhappiness. Therefore, the believer becomes a slave
to the details of life and is a lover of pleasure more than a lover of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><a name="_The_Believer’s_Unconditional"></a><b>The
Believer’s Unconditional Love for Others</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer’s right relationship with others is based on
first having a right love relationship with God that will serve as the
motivation for love relationships with people.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s unconditional love for the new believer is
developed in the maturing believer from intake and application of the Word of
God. The believer’s love for other people when filled with the Holy Spirit is <i>agapao</i>
love and is a mental attitude love. As the believer grows spiritually, this <i>agapao</i>
love matures and is based on the Bible doctrine in their soul. Only then are
they able to have an unconditional <i>agapao</i> love for people that are
obnoxious and even enemies of the believer. This love is commanded of the
believer. John 3:16; James 2:8</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For God so loved the world, that He gave His only
begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal
life.” (John 3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“If, however, you are fulfilling the royal law according to the
Scripture, &quot;YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF,&quot; you are doing
well.” (James 2:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer under the control of the Holy Spirit
produces the fruit of the Spirit or divine good. The filling of the Holy Spirit
can never be earned or deserved. It is always received following salvation on
the grace basis of confession of known sins to God the Father with resultant
filling of the Holy Spirit. Unconditional <i>agapao</i> love is produced by the
filling of the Spirit. This unconditional <i>agape</i> love is the greatest and
the most important of the fruit of the Spirit! Gal. 5:22-23; 1 John 1:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience,
kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things
there is no law.” (Galatians 5:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Agapao</i> love or unconditional love from the filling
of the Spirit is a mental attitude love that is free from arrogance, jealousy,
hatred, envy, bitterness, self-pity, and all the other mental attitude sins. It
is God's will for believers to remain filled with the Holy Spirit. Eph. 5:18;
Rom. 5:5. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but
be filled with the Spirit,” (Ephesians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been
poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.”
(Romans 5:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is God's will for believers to love one another with
unconditional <i>agapao</i> love. This mental attitude love depends upon the
strength of character of the subject and not the attractiveness of the object.
This <i>agapao</i> love is from the source of God and is the basis for human
unconditional love. 1 John 4:10-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us
and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved
us, we also ought to love one another.” (1 John 4:10-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Unconditional <i>agapao</i> love cannot be produced by
the unbeliever or the believer out of fellowship. As believers in Jesus Christ,
we are commanded in the Word of God to love one another with unconditional
love. Nowhere in the Bible does it state that we must form and maintain
personal love relationships with all other Christians. Nowhere in the Bible
does it state that we must understand them, approve of the way they look or
dress, or what they think, or where they go, or what they say. That is their
business. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Unconditional love from the filling of the Holy Spirit
results in a relaxed mental attitude toward everyone in our periphery. There
may be compatibility and rapport in the soul as far as friendship love or
romantic love is concerned, but this is not necessarily unconditional <i>agapao</i>
love. For friendship and romance to be strong and lasting, they must be based
on the virtue of unconditional <i>agapao</i> love.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The dynamics of love is evident in the love of one
believer for another which glorifies God, not man, because this love is made
perfect through the filling of the Holy Spirit. When you are filled with the
Holy Spirit and have mental attitude <i>agapao</i> love, your impact for Christ
changes, but not necessarily your personality. 1 John 4:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“By this, love is perfected with us, so that we may have
confidence in the day of judgment; because as He is, so also are we in this
world.” (1 John 4:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Believer’s Love for Close Friends</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Phileo</i> love is a more mature and stronger love
than <i>agapao</i> love. It is a soul love or rapport love. <i>Phileo</i> love
is a personal love, therefore, <i>phileo</i> love depends on the mature
function of <i>agapao</i> love for stability. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Remember that for both <i>agapao</i> love and <i>phileo</i>
love, the level of their love for others is determined by their own spiritual
growth and can only function when filled with the Holy Spirit. Love in
friendship, whether <i>agapao</i> or <i>phileo</i>, is based on your own level
of spiritual maturity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Phileo</i> love characteristics include; affections of
grace compassion, gracious disposition leading to generosity, kindness,
gracious mental attitude, no vain illusions concerning self, meekness,
humility, courtesy, gentleness, being considerate, relaxed mental attitude,
patience under pressure, endurance, and mastery of the details of life. Col.
3:12-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So, as those who have been chosen of God, holy and beloved,
put on a heart of compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience;
bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, whoever has a complaint
against anyone; just as the Lord forgave you, so also should you.” (Colossians
3:12-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Phileo</i> love is a personal love and is therefore a
love one has for another because of their characteristics and attractiveness to
you. You love God with a personal <i>phileo</i> love because He is perfect in
all of His attributes, because He sent His Son to take on the form of man and
go to the Cross to be your substitute and be judged for your sins, because of
His grace provision to live the spiritual life, because you now have an eternal
future with Him forever, and because of the unmerited grace blessings He has
bestowed on you. John 16:27.</p>

<p class=Verses>“for the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me
and have believed that I came forth from the Father.” (John 16:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You love close friends with a personal <i>phileo</i> love
because of what they are, how they think, and the Bible doctrine evident in
their soul. Husbands and wives love their spouse with a personal <i>phileo</i>
love because of the soul chemistry between them. You love other believers with
a personal <i>phileo</i> love because of their strength of character and the
spiritual maturity you find in them.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 13:1-2, “Let love of the brethren continue” is
the present active imperative of <span lang=EL>φιλαδελφι</span>́<span lang=EL>α</span>
(philadelphia) and means fraternal love, brotherly love. Keep on learning Bible
doctrine daily, for this is your capacity for love. So to fulfill this verse,
we need a maximum knowledge of Bible doctrine and freedom from scar tissue of
the soul.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Let love of the brethren continue. Do not neglect to show
hospitality to strangers, for by this some have entertained angels without
knowing it.” (Hebrews 13:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Having love for people that you have close relationships
with is <i>phileo</i> love or rapport love. This comes through a maximum
knowledge of Bible doctrine and while filled with the Holy Spirit. Confessing
sin biblically puts you into fellowship. The filling of the Holy Spirit and
learning Bible doctrine produces <i>agape</i> love. But spiritual maturity with
maximum Bible doctrine in the soul also produces rapport or <i>phileo</i> love.
<i>Agapao</i> love in the believer must precede <i>phileo</i> or rapport love.
Why? Because <i>phileo</i> or rapport love is based on unconditional <i>agapao</i>
love. Rapport love or <i>phileo</i> love is a personal love and cannot exist
when there are mental attitude sins. It also depend on the unconditional <i>agapao</i>
love for stability.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Bible doctrine is the Word of God, the voice of the Holy
Spirit, and the mind of Christ. The intake and application of Bible doctrine is
the basis of development of personal <i>phileo</i> love for God. This personal
love is your motivation for everything in the spiritual life. Heb. 4:12; Heb.
3:7; 1 Cor. 2:16. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any
two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of
both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the
heart.” (Hebrews 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, just as the Holy Spirit says, &quot;TODAY IF YOU
HEAR HIS VOICE,” (Hebrews 3:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT
HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.” (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For <i>phileo</i> love between believers, this is two
people thinking doctrine. You build your life around doctrine. You both love
doctrine. You talk about doctrine. You even do your kidding around doctrine. 
Doctrine is your life. This rapport is built around Bible doctrine rather than
compatibility of old sin natures. Behind this personal rapport love is
thinking. You still have a relaxed mental attitude. As one grows spiritually,
their capacity grows toward God, family, and friends. See category on <a

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Need For Both Agapao Love and Phileo Love</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>During our Lord’s third post-resurrection appearance to
His disciplines on the shores of the Sea of Galilee, He posed three questions
to Peter to demonstrate the importance of the proper love as the motivation for
the teaching ministry ahead of them. Peter needed to understand the place of
divine enablement in the sense of spiritual gifts. He also needed a strong
personal love for Jesus Christ as his motivation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The First Dialogue </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 21:15, our Lord asks Simon Peter whether he has a
mental attitude love <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>γαπα</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (agapaō) toward Him. “Do you love Me” is the present active
indicative of <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>γαπα</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(agapaō) and refers to mental attitude love. This is a very broad term
indicating an absence of mental attitude sins. Unbelievers can have this love
at times. This is the same love that God has for unbelievers in John 3:16. God
never has <i>phileō</i> or rapport love for the world of unbelief. John 3:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So when they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon
Peter, &quot;Simon, son of John, do you love Me more than these?&quot; He said
to Him, &quot;Yes, Lord; You know that I love You.&quot; He said to him,
&quot;Tend My lambs.&quot;” (John 21:15, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;This is the judgment, that the Light has come into the
world, and men loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were
evil.” (John 3:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For God so loved the world, that He gave His only
begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal
life.” (John 3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 21:15, “more than these” refers directly to the
other disciples and indirectly to the details of life of money, success, pleasure,
social life, friends, loved ones, health, status symbols, sex, and material
things. Peter didn’t appreciate this comparison. He needed more than <i>agapao</i>
love to put the Lord first. <i>Phileo</i> love is a total soul love. Peter and
the other disciples present were being taught a lesson about the importance of <i>agapao</i>
love! </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Peter answered, “Yes, Lord; You know that I love <span
lang=EL>φιλε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (phileō) You.” Peter was hurt
because the Lord didn’t use the word <i>phileō</i> or rapport love with him. Our
Lord’s command to “Tend My lambs” is the present active imperative of <span
lang=EL>βο</span>́<span lang=EL>σκω</span> (boskō) plus <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span
lang=EL>ρνι</span>́<span lang=EL>ον</span> (arnion) and refers to teaching the little
lambs or new immature (babe) believers in basic Bible doctrine. Peter is
commanded to teach according to the Hermeneutical principles of Isagogics,
Categories and Exegesis (ICE). See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/H/Hermeneutics.html">Hermeneutics</a>.
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Like the wife who asks her husband, “Do you love me?” And
he says, “Yes, I love you (mental attitude love).” But she wants rapport love
or soul love, demonstrative love, affectionate love, intimate love, exclusive
love! She wants to hear of his <i>phileō </i>love for her!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Agapao</i> love or mental attitude love is acquired on
a temporary basis through the filling of the Holy Spirit and on a more
permanent basis with the building of the edification complex of the soul. Rom.
5:5; Gal. 5:22; 1 John 2:5. </p>

<p class=Verses>“and hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been
poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.”
(Romans 5:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience,
kindness, goodness, faithfulness,” (Galatians 5:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“but whoever keeps His word, in him the love of God has truly
been perfected. By this we know that we are in Him:” (1 John 2:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At salvation, the believer passes the point of
propitiation and thus comes under maximum divine <i>agapao</i> love. Positional
truth guarantees that God will have <i>agapao</i> love for every believer with
the same amount of love that He has for His Son, Jesus Christ. 1 John 3:2; Eph.
1:6. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Beloved, now we are children of God, and it has not appeared
as yet what we will be. We know that when He appears, we will be like Him,
because we will see Him just as He is.” (1 John 3:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely
bestowed on us in the Beloved.” (Ephesians 1:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Therefore, God can love every believer with a maximum
love regardless of whether the believer is in a state of spirituality (filled
with the Holy Spirit) or carnal (soul controlled by the old sin nature). </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Second Dialogue </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 21:16, our Lord asks Simon Peter a second time “do
you love Me?” and is the present active indicative of <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span
lang=EL>γαπα</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (agapaō) and refers to a mental
attitude love toward Him. He answered, “Yes, Lord; You know that I love <span
lang=EL>φιλε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (phileō) You.” “You know” is <span
lang=EL>οι</span>̓͂<span lang=EL>δα</span> (oida) and is a perfect used as a
present and means Peter loved our Lord in the past and continues to love Him.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He said to him again a second time, &quot;Simon, son of John,
do you love Me?&quot; He said to Him, &quot;Yes, Lord; You know that I love
You.&quot; He said to him, &quot;Shepherd My sheep.&quot;” (John 21:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Instead of <span lang=EL>βο</span>́<span lang=EL>σκω</span>
(boskō) plus <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>ρνι</span>́<span lang=EL>ον</span>
(arnion), He uses <span lang=EL>ποιμαι</span>́<span lang=EL>νω</span>
(poimainō) plus <span lang=EL>προβα</span>́<span lang=EL>τιον</span>
(probation). “Shepherd My sheep” is a pastor-shepherd communicating doctrine to
hard-headed sheep. This refers to feeding the growing, yet somewhat immature
(adolescent) believers in basic and some advanced Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some sheep are led easily. The shepherd doesn’t need the
staff to clobber them to keep them in line. Others are hard-headed and need to
be wacked on the behind in exhortation from the teaching of the Word of God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Peter’s earlier three denials during our Lord’s trials indicated
he did not have a relaxed mental attitude and had no functioning <i>agapao</i>
love. Peter was in carnality and filled with fear. Matt. 26:69-75.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a
servant-girl came to him and said, &quot;You too were with Jesus the
Galilean.&quot; But he denied it before them all, saying, &quot;I do not know
what you are talking about.&quot;” (Matthew 26:69-70, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And again he denied it with an oath, &quot;I do not know the
man.&quot;” (Matthew 26:72, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then he began to curse and swear, &quot;I do not know the
man!&quot; And immediately a rooster crowed.” (Matthew 26:74, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus implied that Peter’s <i>agapao</i> love was not
sufficiently developed in his soul. He needed more Bible doctrine. By repeating
the question to Peter, our Lord is warning us that the words “I love you”
formed in the mind are not sufficient. To say “I love you” and not mean it is
love without essence and just words without meaning. Peter had previously
declared his love in words, but words are no stronger than the spiritual character
of the person who utters them. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Third Dialogue </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 21:17, our Lord asks Simon Peter a third time
whether he has a personal <span lang=EL>φιλε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(phileō) love toward Him. Peter was grieved. “Grieved” is the aorist passive
indicative of λυπέω (lupeō) and means to be upset, to be distressed, mental
anguish. Peter had already said twice that he had phileo love for our Lord. Our
Lord then turns around and says, do you really? Peter answered, “Lord, You know
all things; You know that I love <span lang=EL>φιλε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(phileō) You.” </p>

<p class=Verses>“He said to him the third time, &quot;Simon, son of John, do
you love Me?&quot; Peter was grieved because He said to him the third time,
&quot;Do you love Me?&quot; And he said to Him, &quot;Lord, You know all
things; You know that I love You.&quot; Jesus said to him, &quot;Tend My
sheep.” (John 21:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Peter had been asked three questions by our Lord. His
failure in the three denials earlier had not changed his mental attitude. He
has confessed his sins to God the Father and had moved on in his spiritual
life. He has seen the resurrected Christ. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For the third dialogue, our Lord’s command was to “Tend
My sheep” and is the present active imperative of <span lang=EL>βο</span>́<span
lang=EL>σκω</span> (boskō) plus <span lang=EL>προβα</span>́<span lang=EL>τιον</span>
(probation) and means to promote by teaching in every way the spiritual welfare
of the more mature (adult) believers in advanced Bible doctrine. Such mature
believers are a pleasure to teach. 1 Peter 5:2</p>

<p class=Verses>“shepherd the flock of God among you, exercising oversight not
under compulsion, but voluntarily, according to the will of God; and not for
sordid gain, but with eagerness;” (1 Peter 5:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>By application, in marriage, how can a husband know he is
really loved by his wife when she really gets upset with him? Conversely, how
can a wife know she is really loved by her husband wife when he really gets
upset with her? </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Merely the absence of mental attitude sins toward your
husband, wife, or children is not enough. There must be a capacity to love, a
capacity to express your love in words, a capacity to express your love by your
actions, your passion for your spouse, your rapport of consideration, your physical
love. In a marriage between two mature believers means they both have a
capacity to express their love without being asked, based on the soul love the <i>phileo</i>
love in their soul. This is the highest form of relationship that two believers
can have in life. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The capacity to love is based on <i>epignosis</i> Bible
doctrine in the soul. You get the teaching of Bible doctrine through the power
of the filling of the Holy Spirit and the grace apparatus for perception. The conclusion
is that the most valuable time you spend each day is when you are being fed
spiritually. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Tend my lambs - the new believer. Shepherd my sheep - the
growing or adolescent believer. Tend my sheep - mature believers. Thus, our
capacity to love grows, pastor to congregation and congregation to pastor.
Consequently, the pastor-teacher wishes to protect his sheep from legalism and
false doctrine.</p>
