<h2>Grace Pipeline</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has absolute sovereignty and therefore, has absolute
authority over the universe and has the right to do as He pleases. Psalms
135:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Whatever the LORD pleases, He does, In heaven and in earth, in
the seas and in all deeps.” (Psalms 135:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Long before man became a sinner, God in His sovereignty
made a decision to treat man in grace. Eph. 3:11; Eph. 2:8-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“This was in accordance with the eternal purpose which He
carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord,” (Ephesians 3:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not
of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one
may boast.” (Ephesians 2:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Even though God knew mankind would become sinful, God
would still treat them in grace. God would love the sinner even though they never
deserve it. God still wanted to have fellowship with man and still wanted to
send His love and eternal life to man. But God’s grace can only express itself
in perfect love and eternal life. Love is the motivator of grace. Rom. 5:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we
were yet sinners, Christ died for us.” (Romans 5:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A sin barrier stood in the way so God could not send His absolute
righteousness (+R)<b> </b>through the grace pipeline to man. God with absolute
righteousness (+R)<b> </b>cannot have fellowship with unregenerate man with
relative righteousness (-R). Rom. 3:23; Isaiah 59:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,”
(Romans 3:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But your iniquities have made a separation between you and
your God, And your sins have hidden His face from you so that He does not
hear.” (Isaiah 59:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s justice demands a penalty for sin. The wages of sin
is spiritual death, which is no fellowship with God. Rom. 6:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is
eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Romans 6:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Adam and Eve sinned and died spiritually. As a result, the
human race is born spiritually dead due to the imputation of Adam’s original
sin and a genetically formed old sin nature. All but one (Jesus Christ in His
virgin birth) are incapable of having fellowship with God until they accept the
substitutionary work of Jesus Christ on the Cross. Rom. 5:12.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world,
and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned—”
(Romans 5:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Man does not deserve love from God. God provided grace
because He was motivated to do so. God cannot accept sin nor can He be
associated with sin, but He still loves the sinner unconditionally. Rom. 5:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we
were yet sinners, Christ died for us.” (Romans 5:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Man’s sin stood in the way of God’s love flowing through the
grace pipeline to man. God’s absolute righteousness and justice were not yet
satisfied. In His love, God sent His Son to the Cross to die for the sins of
the whole world. John 3:16; 1 John 2:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For God so loved the world, that He gave His only
begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal
life.” (John 3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins; and not for
ours only, but also for those of the whole world.” (1 John 2:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The penalty of sin is spiritual death. The Lord Jesus
Christ paid for our penalty by His spiritual death while on the Cross and
removed the barrier. Col. 1:20-22.  See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/QR/Reconciliation.html">Reconciliation</a>.
See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/B/Barrier%20Between%20Man%20and%20God.html">The Barrier Between Man and God</a>.
</p>

<p class=Verses>“and through Him to reconcile all things to Himself, having
made peace through the blood of His cross; through Him, I say, whether things
on earth or things in heaven. And although you were formerly alienated and
hostile in mind, engaged in evil deeds, yet He has now reconciled you in His
fleshly body through death, in order to present you before Him holy and
blameless and beyond reproach—” (Colossians 1:20-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God, in His sovereignty, decided to treat man in grace.
God’s perfect absolute righteousness and justice stood in the way because sin
was in the way. Absolute righteousness cannot have fellowship with relative
righteousness. Justice demanded a penalty for sin. In His love, God sent His
Son to the cross to die for the sins of the whole world and pay the penalty for
sin. So God's absolute righteousness and justice are satisfied and love and
eternal life are free to go through the grace pipeline to man. Man now has the
potential for a spiritual life. Now, the only barrier between man and God is
the person of the Lord Jesus Christ. What are you going to do with Christ?</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The unbeliever with negative volition has to try to satisfy
God’s absolute righteousness and justice through human works and human good. In
trying to pay the debt themselves, they will discover that their works are
nothing more than relative righteousness and unacceptable to God. Thus, eternal
separation from God is their destiny in the Lake of Fire.</p>
