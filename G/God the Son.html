name="_God_the_Son"></a><a name="_D-God_the_Son"></a>God the Son</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Son is a member of the Trinity or Godhead. The
Trinity is God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. God the
Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit are not three Gods, but one God,
without blending or dividing of substance. Yet, they are presented with distinctions
as three separate persons in the union of one. The Trinity is defined as the
union of three in one and is revealed as a bona fide doctrine in Scripture. See
category on <a href="#_The_Trinity_1">The Trinity</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><img border=0 width=450 height=350 id="Picture 1"
src="God%20the%20Son.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Son possesses the exact same attributes and
characteristics as does God the Father and God the Holy Spirit. The perfect
absolute characteristics make up God’s essence. They are; Sovereignty,
Righteousness, Justice, Love, Eternal Life, Omniscience, Omnipotence,
Omnipresence, Immutability, and Veracity. All of God's attributes are perfect,
infinite and unchanging. All that God does is simultaneously compatible with
all of His attributes. God has never done nor will ever do anything that
compromises any of His attributes. See category on <a href="#_Essence_of_God">Essence

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God the Son, the Mediator</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A mediator is one who acts as an intermediary agent in
bringing a settlement that is satisfactory to both parties who had been
previously in opposition to each other. The purpose of a mediator is to
interpose between parties in order to reconcile their differences. A mediator
must be equal with both parties. Phil. 2:6-8, John 1:14. </p>

<p class=Verses>“who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard
equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form
of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men. Being found in
appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of
death, even death on a cross.” (Philippians 2:6-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw His
glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.”
(John 1:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sin caused enmity, a wall, a barrier to exist between God
and man. Isa. 59:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But your iniquities have made a separation between you and
your God, And your sins have hidden His face from you so that He does not
hear.” (Isaiah 59:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A mediator was necessary to establish fellowship between
God and man. Job 9:2, Job 9:32-33.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;In truth I know that this is so; But how can a man be in
the right before God?” (Job 9:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For He is not a man as I am that I may answer Him, That
we may go to court together. &quot;There is no umpire between us, Who may lay
his hand upon us both.” (Job 9:32-33, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To satisfy God, the mediator had to be equal to God and
be without sin. To help man, the mediator must be true humanity because He must
take man’s place as a substitute and die spiritually by paying for the sins of
all mankind. God provided the Mediator – the Lord Jesus Christ. Gal. 4:4-5, 1
Tim. 2:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His
Son, born of a woman, born under the Law, so that He might redeem those who
were under the Law, that we might receive the adoption as sons.” (Galatians
4:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For there is one God, and one mediator also between God and
men, the man Christ Jesus,” (1 Timothy 2:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Therefore, Jesus Christ in Hypostatic Union was qualified
to propitiate or satisfy both the perfect righteousness and justice of God the
Father and reconcile man to God. 1 John 2:2, Col. 1:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins; and not for
ours only, but also for those of the whole world.” (1 John 2:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And although you were formerly alienated and hostile in mind,
engaged in evil deeds,” (Colossians 1:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are two areas requiring a mediator. At salvation,
He removes the barrier between God and man. This is called reconciliation. Eph.
2:14-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For He Himself is our peace, who made both groups into one and
broke down the barrier of the dividing wall, by abolishing in His flesh the
enmity, which is the Law of commandments contained in ordinances, so that in
Himself He might make the two into one new man, thus establishing peace, and
might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, by it having
put to death the enmity. AND HE CAME AND PREACHED PEACE TO YOU WHO WERE FAR
AWAY, AND PEACE TO THOSE WHO WERE NEAR; for through Him we both have our access
in one Spirit to the Father.” (Ephesians 2:14-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the spiritual life, Jesus Christ is the believer’s
defense attorney when Satan accuses the believer. 1 John 2:1, 1 Tim. 2:5-6. See
category on <a href="#_D-Advocacy_of_Jesus">Advocacy of Jesus Christ</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“My little children, I am writing these things to you so that
you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus
Christ the righteous;” (1 John 2:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For there is one God, and one mediator also between God and
men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave Himself as a ransom for all, the testimony
given at the proper time.” (1 Timothy 2:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>See category on <a href="#_Jesus_Christ,_Our">Jesus
Christ, Our Mediator</a>. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Ministry of God the Son</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>His virgin birth was planned in eternity past. Psalm 2:7.
</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I will surely tell of the decree of the LORD: He said to
Me, 'You are My Son, Today I have begotten You.” (Psalms 2:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He matured as a normal human being. Isaiah 53:2. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For He grew up before Him like a tender shoot, And like a root
out of parched ground; He has no stately form or majesty That we should look
upon Him, Nor appearance that we should be attracted to Him.” (Isaiah 53:2,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>His humanity was educated in Bible doctrine via the first
use of the grace apparatus for perception. Isa. 50:4-5. </p>

<p class=Verses>“The Lord GOD has given Me the tongue of disciples, That I may
know how to sustain the weary one with a word. He awakens Me morning by
morning, He awakens My ear to listen as a disciple. The Lord GOD has opened My
ear; And I was not disobedient Nor did I turn back.” (Isaiah 50:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>His humanity was sustained by the Holy Spirit during His
time on earth. He was baptized (a unique baptism) signifying that He had come
to do the Father’s will. He was identified with water, the water signifying the
Father’s will. He explained His own ministry in Luke 4:14-21 and Luke 4:30 by
quoting from Isaiah 61:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me, Because the LORD has
anointed me To bring good news to the afflicted; He has sent me to bind up the
brokenhearted, To proclaim liberty to captives And freedom to prisoners; To
proclaim the favorable year of the LORD And the day of vengeance of our God; To
comfort all who mourn,” (Isaiah 61:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He preached the Gospel to anyone needing salvation. He
healed the broken hearted by giving inner peace through salvation. He preached
deliverance to the captives. He set them free from the powers of darkness
(Satan and His fallen angels). Col. 1:13. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For He rescued us from the domain of darkness, and transferred
us to the kingdom of His beloved Son,” (Colossians 1:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He recovered sight for the blind and the spiritually
blind - unbelievers. He set at liberty them that are bruised. He paid the
penalty and was bruised for us. He preached the year of acceptance of the Lord.
He told the Jews He was the promised redeemer. John 8:12, Isa. 53:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Jesus again spoke to them, saying, &quot;I am the Light
of the world; he who follows Me will not walk in the darkness, but will have
the Light of life.&quot;” (John 8:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But He was pierced through for our transgressions, He was
crushed for our iniquities; The chastening for our well-being fell upon Him,
And by His scourging we are healed.” (Isaiah 53:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He had a ministry to His disciples. The Sermon on the
Mount was a crash program to train them so they could reach the multitudes. He
had a ministry with His disciples to the tax collectors and the prostitutes. He
had a ministry in miracles and in parables. Matt. 20:28.</p>

<p class=Verses>“just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to
serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.&quot;” (Matthew 20:28, NASB)</p>
