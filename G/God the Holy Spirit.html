<h2><a name="_God_the_Holy"></a><a name="_D-God_the_Holy"></a>God the Holy
Spirit</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Holy Spirit is a member of the Trinity or
Godhead. The Trinity is God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.
God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit are not three Gods, but
one God, without blending or dividing of substance. Yet, they are presented
with distinctions as three separate persons in the union of one. The Trinity is
defined as the union of three in one and is revealed as a bona fide doctrine in
Scripture. See category on <a href="#_The_Trinity_1">The Trinity</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><img border=0 width=450 height=350 id="Picture 1"
src="God%20the%20Holy%20Spirit.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Holy Spirit possesses the exact same attributes
and characteristics as does God the Father and God the Son. The perfect
absolute characteristics make up God’s essence. They are; Sovereignty,
Righteousness, Justice, Love, Eternal Life, Omniscience, Omnipotence,
Omnipresence, Immutability, and Veracity. All of God's attributes are perfect,
infinite and unchanging. All that God does is simultaneously compatible with
all of His attributes. God has never done nor will ever do anything that
compromises any of His attributes. See category on <a
href="#_DV3-The_Essence_of">Essence of God</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Restoration of the Earth </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Holy Spirit restored the chaotic earth in six
literal 24-hour days. The entire universe including planet earth was originally
created by God the Son - Jesus Christ and He did it all instantaneously by
uttering a single word. The earth was originally created perfect and beautiful.
Satan and the angelic revolt ruined the earth and made it into an uninhabitable
and chaotic dump. The time of the restoration of the earth by God the Holy
Spirit is unknown. Genesis 1:2, Psalm 104:30.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The earth was formless and void, and darkness was over the
surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was moving over the surface of the
waters.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis 1:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“You send forth Your Spirit, they are created; And You renew
the face of the ground.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 104:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 1:2, “the Spirit of God was moving” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL>רָחַף</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(rachaph) and means to
shake, to move. God the Holy Spirit moved over the earth warming and melting
the ice pack that had surrounded the earth. This was the first step in the
earth’s restoration. The Holy Spirit restored the earth in six literal 24-hour
days. God the Holy Spirit restored the earth from existing chaotic materials,
water, barrenness. See category on <a href="#_D-Creation_and_Restoration">Creation
and Restoration</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Holy Spirit’s Seven Salvation Ministries</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>God the Holy Spirit performs seven
ministries for each Church Age believer at salvation. None of these functions
or ministries make you feel better or feel differently. Although you may have
had an emotional experience when you first believed in Jesus Christ, none of
the Holy Spirit salvation ministries are associated with an emotional response.
These seven salvation ministries form the basis for unity among believers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Holy Spirit is the member of the Trinity that
provides the empowerment for each of us to live the spiritual life. Without
Him, we could not have become saved even though we had positive faith belief,
we could not learn any divine truths, and we could never have fellowship with
God. Without His divine power in each of us, would have no power to function
spiritually.  See category on <a href="#_D-Holy_Spirit,_Seven_1">Holy Spirit,
Seven Salvation Ministries</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Holy Spirit’s Sustaining Ministry of Jesus Christ </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Holy Spirit sustained the humanity of Jesus Christ at
His birth. The humanity of Jesus Christ relied on the sustaining ministry of
the Holy Spirit and was led and guided by the Holy Spirit. Jesus Christ was
sustained by the Holy Spirit only in His humanity because Jesus Christ is
co-equal with the Holy Spirit in His deity. As the God-man, He revealed the
essence of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The omnipotence of the Holy Spirit sustained Jesus Christ
during His substitutionary spiritual death on the cross for the sins of
mankind. Holy Spirit had a part in the resurrection of Jesus Christ. The
present ministry of the Holy Spirit to Jesus Christ is to glorify Jesus Christ
in the life of every believer. See category on <a
href="#_Holy_Spirit,_Sustaining">Holy Spirit, Sustaining Ministry to Jesus
Christ</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Indwelling of The Holy Spirit </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Church Age, the permanent indwelling of the Holy
Spirit prepares a suitable residence in the body of every believer for the
permanent indwelling of Jesus Christ as the Shekinah Glory and for the
permanent indwelling of God the Father. This all occurs at the moment of
salvation. This makes the body of the believer the sanctuary or temple of God.
In the Old Testament, the sanctuary was the tabernacle in the tent in the
desert or the temple in Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Church Age, from the Day of Pentecost to the
Rapture of the Church, the Holy Spirit permanently indwells every believer at
the moment of salvation. The indwelling of the Holy Spirit in the body of the
believer makes it impossible for demon possession to occur. See category on the
<a href="#_D-Holy_Spirit,_Indwelling">Holy Spirit, Indwelling</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Filling of the Holy Spirit </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The filling of God the Holy Spirit is where the
believer’s soul is controlled by the Holy Spirit. This is the only means of
spiritual growth in that the enabling power of the Holy Spirit allows the grace
function of the grace apparatus for perception whereby Bible doctrine is
learned, believed, and applied. This is all about God's grace resources, not
the believer’s human capabilities. Only then can <i>epignosis</i> Bible
doctrine in the right lobe of the soul enable the believer to produce divine
good in their spiritual lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The process of being filled with the Spirit is
accomplished by confession of sin biblically. We are commanded to be habitually
filled with the Holy Spirit. See category on the <a href="#_D-Filling_of_the">Filling
of the Holy Spirit</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Holy Spirit’s Ministry in Dispensations</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In each of the four dispensations, the Holy Spirit
convinces of sin, righteousness and judgment. He helps communicate the Gospel
to unbelievers. The Holy Spirit is responsible for regeneration in each of the
four dispensations. Salvation is always the same. See category on the <a
href="#_Holy_Spirit,_Ministry">Holy Spirit’s Ministry in Dispensations</a>.</p>
