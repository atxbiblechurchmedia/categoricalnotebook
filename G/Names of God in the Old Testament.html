<h2>Names of God in the Old Testament</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Why study the names of God?  The essence of Christianity
is to have a rapport love relationship with God. This is only accomplished by
knowing about God - what He likes, what He does not like, who He is, and what
He has already done and what He now does. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To learn about God, we must begin with the essence of
God, which essence is always disclosed in association with the names of God. We
can see the direct relationship between many of the names of God and his person
and work. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/G/God%E2%80%99s%20Essence.html">God's Essence</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is clear that God likes to exploit a language to the
maximum to get across the information of His plan. In English, we have a
limited vocabulary when naming God, but it has increased – God, Lord, Father,
and Jesus Christ. There is little to these names actually. Basically, the only
thing we connect with them is the concept of deity. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew language, which is a fantastically beautiful
and descriptive language, utilizes that characteristic to the maximum in giving
names to God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1. El </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>2. Elah </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>3. Eloah</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>4. Elohim </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>5. El Elyon </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>6. El Shadday </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>7. Adon</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>8. Adonay</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>9. Jehovah</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>10. Jehovah of Hosts</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>11. The Holy One</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>12. The Branch</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>13. The Rock</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>14. The Mighty One</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>15. Mighty One</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>16. Shepherd of Israel </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>17. Son of Man </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>El: </b><b><span lang=HE dir=RTL>אל</span></b><span
dir=LTR></span><b><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>('êl), Eloah: </b><span
dir=RTL></span><b><span lang=HE dir=RTL><span dir=RTL></span> אֱלוֹהַ</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span>('ĕlôah), Elah </b><b><span lang=HE
dir=RTL>אֵלָה</span></b><span dir=LTR></span><b><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>('êlâh), and Elohim: </b><b><span lang=HE dir=RTL>אֱלֹהִים</span></b><span
dir=LTR></span><b><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>('ĕlôhı̂ym). </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All are translated “God.” These are all basically from
the same roots. There are some Hebrew words that can’t be traced to only one
root. These four are such. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>El is most likely a participle from this root and means
the one who is strong, mighty, and prominent. And, we can see omnipotence in
that.  There is connection to the root that means to declare, swear, curse make
a covenant by oath. Again a participle would indicate the one who swears or
declares. This would involve his sovereignty and activity of making covenants
with mankind. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All four of these words then, have the idea of
omnipotence and sovereignty inherent in the meaning of the word alone, creative
and governing power. These are generic terms used for the concept of deity in
general. However originally not so - deity, majesty and authority and power.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>El: </b><b><span lang=HE dir=RTL>אל</span></b><span
dir=LTR></span><b><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>('êl) </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>El occurs 204 times for the “true God” and 18 times for
the “other than.”  It is used primarily in Job (55 times), Psalms (59 times),
and Isaiah (25 times). It is used once in Lamentations and once in Proverbs. It
is characteristic of poetry and usually in compound with something else when
used in prose. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The plural of El is Elim  <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>אֵילִם</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'><span dir=LTR></span> </span>and is
never used of the true God.  El is never used with “their, his, your” but only
with the first person, “my” or “our.” The word is used of men to indicate the
strong and mighty concept.  It is also used of gods, heathen type. Exodus
34:14; Psalms 81:10; Isaiah 44:10. </p>

<p class=Verses>“—for you shall not worship any other god, for the LORD, whose
name is Jealous, is a jealous God—” (Exodus 34:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I, the LORD, am your God, Who brought you up from the
land of Egypt; Open your mouth wide and I will fill it.” (Psalms 81:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Who has fashioned a god or cast an idol to no profit?” (Isaiah
44:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>El is used basically to indicate deity, the mighty and
strong one. It is used in compounds such as Bethel, House of God, Mountain of
God.  All the following characteristics of deity are ascribed to the title El: Sovereignty,
Righteous, Justice, Love, Eternal Life, Omnipresent, Omnipotent, Omniscient, Immutability,
Veracity, and El as creator. El is used when the focus is on the deity of the
Godhead with no emphasis on the plurality of the Godhead. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>El  <span lang=HE dir=RTL>אל</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span> executes judgment in Numbers 24:23, El
brought Israel out of Egypt in Numbers 23:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then he took up his discourse and said, &quot;Alas, who can
live except God has ordained it?” (Numbers 24:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;God brings them out of Egypt, He is for them like the
horns of the wild ox.” (Numbers 23:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>El is identified as the Rock, the foundation of
salvation, in Deuteronomy 32:18. El has redeemed people in Psalms 31:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You neglected the Rock who begot you, And forgot the God
who gave you birth.” (Deuteronomy 32:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Into Your hand I commit my spirit; You have ransomed me, O
LORD, God of truth.” (Psalms 31:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Job 33:4, there is reference to the Spirit of El
(Elihu). El is the object of prayer in Numbers 12:13 and Numbers 16:22. El
provides military victory in Numbers 23:23. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Moses cried out to the LORD, saying, &quot;O God, heal her, I
pray!&quot;” (Numbers 12:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For there is no omen against Jacob, Nor is there any
divination against Israel; At the proper time it shall be said to Jacob And to
Israel, what God has done!” (Numbers 23:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The words of Eternal life are found in Numbers 24:4 and
Numbers 24:16. God calls Himself Eternal life in Genesis 46:3-4 to Jacob.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The oracle of him who hears the words of God, Who sees the
vision of the Almighty, Falling down, yet having his eyes uncovered,” (Numbers
24:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The oracle of him who hears the words of God, And knows the
knowledge of the Most High, Who sees the vision of the Almighty, Falling down,
yet having his eyes uncovered.” (Numbers 24:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He said, &quot;I am God, the God of your father; do not be
afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will make you a great nation there. &quot;I
will go down with you to Egypt, and I will also surely bring you up again; and
Joseph will close your eyes.&quot;” (Genesis 46:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Elah:</b> <b><span lang=HE dir=RTL>אֵלָה</span></b><span
dir=LTR></span><b><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>('êlâh) </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is an Aramaic word. Elah is used 84 times, 72 time
of the “true God.” Elah is used 37 times in Ezra and 46 times in Dan and once
in Jeremiah 10:11 for “gods.” Elah is used just like El is. El does not occur
in Ezra and only 4 times in Daniel. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Thus you shall say to them, &quot;The gods that did not make
the heavens and the earth will perish from the earth and from under the
heavens.&quot;” (Jeremiah 10:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>So this too focuses on the deity of the Godhead and not
the plurality. Elah is almost entirely used in connection with sovereignty and
omnipotence. Elah refers to God's sovereignty, God of heaven, many times in
Ezra and in Daniel 2:21-22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;It is He who changes the times and the epochs; He
removes kings and establishes kings; He gives wisdom to wise men And knowledge
to men of understanding. &quot;It is He who reveals the profound and hidden
things; He knows what is in the darkness, And the light dwells with Him.”
(Daniel 2:21-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Elah refers to God's Omnipotence in Daniel 3:17 and
Daniel 2:20. Elah refers to God's Omniscience in Ezra 7:25 and Daniel 2:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us
from the furnace of blazing fire; and He will deliver us out of your hand, O
king.” (Daniel 3:17, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“Daniel said, &quot;Let the name of God be blessed forever and
ever, For wisdom and power belong to Him.” (Daniel 2:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You, Ezra, according to the wisdom of your God which is
in your hand, appoint magistrates and judges that they may judge all the people
who are in the province beyond the River, even all those who know the laws of
your God; and you may teach anyone who is ignorant of them.” (Ezra 7:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Eloah: </b><span dir=RTL></span><b><span lang=HE
dir=RTL><span dir=RTL></span> אֱלוֹהַ</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span>('ĕlôah)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Eloah is used 57 times, 50 times as the “true God.” Eloah
is used 41 times in Job, four times in Psalms, once in Proverbs 30:5 and once
in Isaiah 44:8. Eloah is used ten times in prose, 49 times in poetry. Only
three of those used in prose for the “true God.” Always used in poetry for the
“true God.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Eloah is the singular of Elohim, but primarily it is used
in poetry and has the same function as does El and Elah. That is the focus is
on deity of the Godhead and not on the plurality of it. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Eloah emphasizes God's sovereignty in Psalms 18:31 and Isaiah
44:8. Eloah emphasizes God's justice and immutability in Nehemiah 9:17 and in
Job. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For who is God, but the LORD? And who is a rock, except our
God,” (Psalms 18:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“'Do not tremble and do not be afraid; Have I not long since
announced it to you and declared it? And you are My witnesses. Is there any God
besides Me, Or is there any other Rock? I know of none.'&quot;” (Isaiah 44:8,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;They refused to listen, And did not remember Your
wondrous deeds which You had performed among them; So they became stubborn and
appointed a leader to return to their slavery in Egypt. But You are a God of
forgiveness, Gracious and compassionate, Slow to anger and abounding in
lovingkindness; And You did not forsake them.” (Nehemiah 9:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Eloah emphasizes God's omnipotence and as the Creator in
Job 35:10 and God's immutability in Nehemiah 9:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But no one says, 'Where is God my Maker, Who gives songs
in the night,” (Job 35:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses> “You, in Your great compassion, Did not forsake them in the
wilderness; The pillar of cloud did not leave them by day, To guide them on
their way, Nor the pillar of fire by night, to light for them the way in which
they were to go.” (Nehemiah 9:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Eloah is a God of forgiveness, gracious, compassionate, slow
to anger, and abounding in lovingkindness in Nehemiah 9:17. In Proverbs 30:5,
every word of God is tested and He is our shield.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;They refused to listen, And did not remember Your
wondrous deeds which You had performed among them; So they became stubborn and
appointed a leader to return to their slavery in Egypt. But You are a God of
forgiveness, Gracious and compassionate, Slow to anger and abounding in
lovingkindness; And You did not forsake them.” (Nehemiah 9:17, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“Every word of God is tested; He is a shield to those who take
refuge in Him.” (Proverbs 30:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Eloah emphasizes God as the Creator in Deuteronomy 32:15.
Eloah gave His good Spirit to instruct in Nehemiah 9:20. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But Jeshurun grew fat and kicked— You are grown fat,
thick, and sleek— Then he forsook God who made him, And scorned the Rock of his
salvation.” (Deuteronomy 32:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You gave Your good Spirit to instruct them, Your manna
You did not withhold from their mouth, And You gave them water for their
thirst.” (Nehemiah 9:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>El, Elah and Eloah can refer to the Godhead or to any
member of the Godhead. When referring to any member of the Godhead, there will
be additional names with it to indicate which person. Of course, the function
of that particular member of the Godhead will be according to the whole plan of
the Godhead.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Elohim: </b><b><span lang=HE dir=RTL>אֱלֹהִים</span></b><span
dir=LTR></span><b><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>('ĕlôhı̂ym) </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Elohim occurs 2,555 times, 3,210 for “God” and 245 in
other ways. Elohim is plural in form, but when referring to God, it usually
takes singular verbs and adjectives. The first issue is the significance of the
plural.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is not agreement among theologians, but evidence is
overwhelmingly convincing that it is plural of persons to indicate the three
members of the Godhead, the Trinity. The singular can’t express the presence of
the three persons.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In usage, it is very closely related to the other three
words we’ve looked at. This one, however, while focusing on deity, power and
covenant making, stresses the plurality of the Godhead, not three Gods, but one
Godhead with three members.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Elohim is the name for God which the Bible begins with in
Genesis 1. Here, we definitely see the omnipotence in creation emphasized. In
Genesis 1:1 through Genesis 2:4 it occurs (and only it) 35 times. One of the
best indications of a Trinity is also found in Genesis 1:26. “Let us make man
in our image.”  </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then God said, &quot;Let Us make man in Our image, according
to Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds
of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth, and over every creeping
thing that creeps on the earth.&quot;” (Genesis 1:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Elohim is used with or without the definite article with
no change in meaning. Elohim is called the Rock in Psalms 18:31 and Psalms
78:35. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For who is God, but the LORD? And who is a rock, except our
God,” (Psalms 18:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And they remembered that God was their rock, And the Most High
God their Redeemer.” (Psalms 78:35, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Elohim provides victory in war. Psalms 44:1, Psalms 44:4.
Elohim will redeem my (David) soul from the grave. Psalms 49:15. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For the choir director. A Maskil of the sons of Korah. O God,
we have heard with our ears, Our fathers have told us The work that You did in
their days, In the days of old.” (Psalms 44:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“You are my King, O God; Command victories for Jacob.” (Psalms
44:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol, For He
will receive me. Selah.” (Psalms 49:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>David addresses prayer to Elohim in Psalms 51. Elohim
will regather Israel in Psalms 53:6 and Psalms 69:35. Elohim has taught David
from his youth in Psalms 71:17. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion! When
God restores His captive people, Let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad.”
(Psalms 53:6, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“For God will save Zion and build the cities of Judah, That
they may dwell there and possess it.” (Psalms 69:35, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“O God, You have taught me from my youth, And I still declare
Your wondrous deeds.” (Psalms 71:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Enoch and Noah walked with Elohim.  Elohim brought Noah
and crew safely to shore after the flood. Gen. 8. Elohim is the one who made
the Noahic Covenant. Gen. 9. In Exodus 2, it is Elohim who remembers His
covenant with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Elohim is the Godhead in Exodus 3 where
the Godhead gives itself the name, Jehovah.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Judges 13:9, the Angel of the Lord (Jehovah) is called
the Angel of God (Elohim). Elohim is used of heathen gods in many places also
with singular verbs as in Judges 11:24.</p>

<p class=Verses>“God listened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came
again to the woman as she was sitting in the field, but Manoah her husband was
not with her.” (Judges 13:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“'Do you not possess what Chemosh your god gives you to
possess? So whatever the LORD our God has driven out before us, we will possess
it.” (Judges 11:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Elohim is used of human judges in Exodus 22:8-9, Exodus
22:28, Exodus 21:6, and Psalms 82:1-6. In Psalms 82:6, God gives them the title
of gods. John 10:34. This title is given to them because as judges they
represent God to the people. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;If the thief is not caught, then the owner of the house
shall appear before the judges, to determine whether he laid his hands on his
neighbor's property. &quot;For every breach of trust, whether it is for ox, for
donkey, for sheep, for clothing, or for any lost thing about which one says,
'This is it,' the case of both parties shall come before the judges; he whom
the judges condemn shall pay double to his neighbor.” (Exodus 22:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You shall not curse God, nor curse a ruler of your
people.” (Exodus 22:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“then his master shall bring him to God, then he shall bring
him to the door or the doorpost. And his master shall pierce his ear with an
awl; and he shall serve him permanently.” (Exodus 21:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“I said, &quot;You are gods, And all of you are sons of the
Most High.” (Psalms 82:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Jesus answered them, &quot;Has it not been written in your
Law, 'I SAID, YOU ARE GODS'?” (John 10:34, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jehovah tells Moses that Aaron will function as the mouth
of Moses to represent Moses and that Moses will be to Aaron as God (Elohim).
The preposition used here has many meanings, but here it means “for, on behalf
of” and is used in the sense of representation. Aaron will function as Moses’
mouth and Moses will function as representative to him of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Exodus 7:1, “make” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>נתן</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(nâthan) in the Hebrew and means to give or appoint. “I
have appointed you Elohim to Pharaoh.” Moses as the representative of God to
Pharaoh has the full authority of God, thus the designation. “And your brother
Aaron shall be your prophet.” Moses as having full authority of God has a
prophet to administer that authority to those he deals with in his chain of
command. Moses represents Elohim to the Egyptians and also administers divine
judgements through his prophet Aaron. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD said to Moses, &quot;See, I make you as God to
Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron shall be your prophet.” (Exodus 7:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Elohim is used of angels in Psalms 97:9 and Hebrews 1:6.
Compare Psalms 8:5 with Hebrews 2:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For You are the LORD Most High over all the earth; You are
exalted far above all gods.” (Psalms 97:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And when He again brings the firstborn into the world, He
says, &quot;AND LET ALL THE ANGELS OF GOD WORSHIP HIM.&quot;” (Hebrews 1:6,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Yet You have made him a little lower than God, And You crown
him with glory and majesty!” (Psalms 8:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;YOU HAVE MADE HIM FOR A LITTLE WHILE LOWER THAN THE
ANGELS; YOU HAVE CROWNED HIM WITH GLORY AND HONOR, AND HAVE APPOINTED HIM OVER
THE WORKS OF YOUR HANDS;” (Hebrews 2:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>El Elyon; </b><b><span style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'> </span></b><b><span

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is the Aramaic form  <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>עִלַּי</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span>  which occurs nine times and only in Daniel. The emphasis is
always on the sovereignty of God with omnipotence also, in view. The Hebrew
form  <b><span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>עֶלְיוֹן</span></b><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span>  occurs four times in Daniel for “saints
of the Most High.”  Sovereignty is in view as they belong to Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>El Elyon occurs in other places 31 times mostly in Psalms
19. El Elyon is first used in Genesis 14:18. Melchizedek uses the title as the
possessor of heaven and earth. Strong focus on sovereignty. Abraham says
Jehovah is the Most High God. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine; now
he was a priest of God Most High.” (Genesis 14:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We see His omniscience in Numbers 24:16 and Psalms 73:11.
</p>

<p class=Verses>“The oracle of him who hears the words of God, And knows the
knowledge of the Most High, Who sees the vision of the Almighty, Falling down,
yet having his eyes uncovered.” (Numbers 24:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“They say, &quot;How does God know? And is there knowledge with
the Most High?&quot;” (Psalms 73:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Most High God is the Redeemer in Psalms 78:35. The
Most High is our Protector in Psalms 91:1 and Psalms 91:9. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And they remembered that God was their rock, And the Most High
God their Redeemer.” (Psalms 78:35, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High Will abide in
the shadow of the Almighty.” (Psalms 91:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For you have made the LORD, my refuge, Even the Most High,
your dwelling place.” (Psalms 91:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Two times we have Jehovah the Most High with sovereignty
in focus in Psalms 7:17 and Psalms 37:5. </p>

<p class=Verses>“I will give thanks to the LORD according to His righteousness
And will sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High.” (Psalms 7:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Commit your way to the LORD, Trust also in Him, and He will do
it.” (Psalms 37:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 107:11, the children of Israel are said to have
disdained the counsel of the Most High. Actually this is an attack on His
sovereignty. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Because they had rebelled against the words of God And spurned
the counsel of the Most High.” (Psalms 107:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is clear that Satan, in Isaiah 14:14, has his eyes on
God’s position of sovereignty for here he uses the term the Most High.  In all
35 places, the focus is on the sovereignty of God. After the examination of the
passages we also can see that the title refers to God the Father the first
person of the Godhead, not the second or third. </p>

<p class=Verses>“'I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will make
myself like the Most High.'” (Isaiah 14:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The term “on high” or <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>מרום</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(mârôm) in the hebrew is from a verb <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>רוּם</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(rûm) meaning to be high, exalted, and
occurs once in Micah 6:6 for the Most High and here the focus is on sovereignty
in a context of worship. </p>

<p class=Verses>“With what shall I come to the LORD And bow myself before the
God on high? Shall I come to Him with burnt offerings, With yearling calves?”
(Micah 6:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Septuagint, the Most High is consistently
translated as <span lang=EL>υ</span>̔́<span lang=EL>ψιστος</span> (hupsistos).
This Greek word is also used four times in the New Testament with definite
reference to the sovereignty of God the Father. Luke 1:32, Luke 1:35, Luke
1:76, Luke 6:35.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most
High; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David;” (Luke
1:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting
nothing in return; and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the
Most High; for He Himself is kind to ungrateful and evil men.” (Luke 6:35,
NASB)</p>

Shadday standing alone.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>El Shadday occurs 48 times with 31 of those in Job
standing alone. The Almighty or all powerful provider is our self-sufficient
provider of nourishment, blessing, etc. In the English it is translated as the
Almighty or God Almighty. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 17:1-8, The Almighty makes the Abrahamic
Covenant, a Covenant of blessing and fruitfulness.  In Genesis 28:3-4, Isaac
speaks to Jacob of blessing and many descendants.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I will establish My covenant between Me and you, And I
will multiply you exceedingly.&quot;” (Genesis 17:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;May God Almighty bless you and make you fruitful and
multiply you, that you may become a company of peoples. &quot;May He also give
you the blessing of Abraham, to you and to your descendants with you, that you
may possess the land of your sojournings, which God gave to Abraham.&quot;”
(Genesis 28:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 35:11-12, God Almighty confirms the Abrahamic
Covenant to Jacob. “Be fruitful and multiply.” In Genesis 43:14, Jacob asks God
Almighty to give his children mercy before “that man” in Egypt. </p>

<p class=Verses>“God also said to him, &quot;I am God Almighty; Be fruitful and
multiply; A nation and a company of nations shall come from you, And kings
shall come forth from you. &quot;The land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I
will give it to you, And I will give the land to your descendants after
you.&quot;” (Genesis 35:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and may God Almighty grant you compassion in the sight of the
man, so that he will release to you your other brother and Benjamin. And as for
me, if I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.&quot;” (Genesis 43:14,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 49:22-26, in blessing Joseph, Joseph was a
fruitful bough. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Joseph is a fruitful bough, A fruitful bough by a
spring; Its branches run over a wall. &quot;The archers bitterly attacked him,
And shot at him and harassed him; But his bow remained firm, And his arms were
agile, From the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob (From there is the Shepherd,
the Stone of Israel), From the God of your father who helps you, And by the
Almighty who blesses you With blessings of heaven above, Blessings of the deep
that lies beneath, Blessings of the breasts and of the womb. &quot;The blessings
of your father Have surpassed the blessings of my ancestors Up to the utmost
bound of the everlasting hills; May they be on the head of Joseph, And on the
crown of the head of the one distinguished among his brothers.” (Genesis
49:22-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Numbers 24:4-7, the vision of the Almighty of Balaam
indicates blessing, prosperity and production. In Numbers 24:16, is the vision
of the Almighty indicating ultimate provision and a promise of Messiah and
victory over enemies. </p>

<p class=Verses>“The oracle of him who hears the words of God, Who sees the
vision of the Almighty, Falling down, yet having his eyes uncovered, How fair
are your tents, O Jacob, Your dwellings, O Israel! &quot;Like valleys that
stretch out, Like gardens beside the river, Like aloes planted by the LORD,
Like cedars beside the waters. &quot;Water will flow from his buckets, And his
seed will be by many waters, And his king shall be higher than Agag, And his
kingdom shall be exalted.” (Numbers 24:4-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The oracle of him who hears the words of God, And knows the
knowledge of the Most High, Who sees the vision of the Almighty, Falling down,
yet having his eyes uncovered.” (Numbers 24:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ruth 1:20-21, The Almighty afflicted Ruth. Divine
discipline for her husband and two sons. Her undeserved suffering was for her
ultimate benefit and blessing. The greatest periods of blessing and grace
provision will be during and after times of undeserved suffering. </p>

<p class=Verses>“She said to them, &quot;Do not call me Naomi; call me Mara,
for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me. &quot;I went out full, but
the LORD has brought me back empty. Why do you call me Naomi, since the LORD
has witnessed against me and the Almighty has afflicted me?&quot;” (Ruth
1:20-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Job, the Almighty is used as the normal title for God
other than Eloah. We see Him in discipline, in Job’s opinion and in Eliphaz’s
opinion. Wrath of the Almighty. Almighty your defense. Almighty the life giver.
Make supplication to Almighty. Almighty won’t pervert judgment. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>So we can see that the emphasis is on God as the provider
of personal blessing and prosperity, military victory, spiritual prosperity and
blessing. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Adon: </b><b><span lang=HE dir=RTL>אדון</span></b><span
dir=LTR></span><b><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>('âdôn) </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Adnon</i> means master, sir, or Lord. It is used in
the singular for men (as expected). However, when it is used of God, it occurs
in the plural and in the singular. The name signifies ownership or mastership
and indicates the truth that God is the owner of every believer and that he
consequently claims the unrestricted obedience of all. It indicates
sovereignty, ownership, rulership, slave-master relation and usually is used to
express deity and sovereignty more than the other attributes. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 97:5, God of the whole earth in referenced. In
Psalms 114:7, God's sovereign deliverance of Israel from Egypt is emphasized. </p>

<p class=Verses>“The mountains melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, At
the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.” (Psalms 97:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Tremble, O earth, before the Lord, Before the God of Jacob,”
(Psalms 114:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 18:3, “My Lord” and in Genesis 24:12, “my
master.”</p>

<p class=Verses>“and said, &quot;My Lord, if now I have found favor in Your
sight, please do not pass Your servant by.” (Genesis 18:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He said, &quot;O LORD, the God of my master Abraham, please
grant me success today, and show lovingkindness to my master Abraham.” (Genesis
24:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Adonay: </b><b><span lang=HE dir=RTL>אדני</span></b><span
dir=LTR></span><b><span dir=LTR></span> ('ădônây)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It also mean’s master, Lord, sir, Lord. A title of
respect. Used only of God. The form is in the plural and looks like it has a
first person singular suffix. Being in the plural, it has the same significance
as does Elohim. It indicates the plurality of the Godhead. Adonay occurs 425
times, mostly in Psalms, Isaiah and mostly in Ezekiel. Mostly it occurs with
Jehovah as “Adonay Jehovah.” </p>

<p class=Verses>“And the LORD said to Abraham, &quot;Why did Sarah laugh,
saying, 'Shall I indeed bear a child, when I am so old?'” (Genesis 18:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 20:1-6, Abimelech calls Lord (Elohim Adonay)
as he talks with Him in a dream. There is indication of an attitude of
submission. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Now Abimelech had not come near her; and he said, &quot;Lord,
will You slay a nation, even though blameless?” (Genesis 20:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Moses addresses Jehovah as both Jehovah and Adonay,
mostly Jehovah. He uses it to indicate the relationship of master-servant.
Exodus 4:10, Exodus 4:13, Exodus 5:22, Exodus 34:9. These are the only places
for Adonay in Exodus.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Moses said to the LORD, &quot;Please, Lord, I have never
been eloquent, neither recently nor in time past, nor since You have spoken to
Your servant; for I am slow of speech and slow of tongue.&quot;” (Exodus 4:10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Moses returned to the LORD and said, &quot;O Lord, why
have You brought harm to this people? Why did You ever send me?” (Exodus 5:22,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The only two times that Joshua addresses Jehovah he uses
Adonay. Joshua 7:7-8. As the eye of a servant looks to his master, so Joshua in
defeat and distress looks for direction to Adonay Jehovah. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Joshua said, &quot;Alas, O Lord GOD, why did You ever bring
this people over the Jordan, only to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites,
to destroy us? If only we had been willing to dwell beyond the Jordan! &quot;O
Lord, what can I say since Israel has turned their back before their enemies?”
(Joshua 7:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Adonay is used only once in Job 28:28. Job says the fear
of Adonay is wisdom. Fear here meaning reverential trust, reverence and
obedience, an attitude of worship. Fear indicates relationship and fellowship. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;And to man He said, 'Behold, the fear of the Lord, that
is wisdom; And to depart from evil is understanding.'&quot;” (Job 28:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>So, basically we can trace in Adonay a master/slave
relationship. Blessing while the slave does his master’s bidding, but when the
slave cuts off fellowship there is discipline. When Adonay judges the nations
who come against his slaves we see the master faithful in protection. In the
prophecies of the Messiah and the regathering, we see the master providing
maximum blessing for those who serve him. So, throughout the Old Testament
those who know God as Adonay acknowledge themselves as servants. Abraham, Isaac
and Jacob are thus spoken of in Exodus 32:13 and elsewhere. Over and over we
read, “Moses, my servant, Moses the servant of Jehovah.” David addressing God
as Adonay uses the phrase “your servant.” Solomon, Nehemiah, Samuel. Joshua
24:29.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Your servants to
whom You swore by Yourself, and said to them, 'I will multiply your descendants
as the stars of the heavens, and all this land of which I have spoken I will
give to your descendants, and they shall inherit it forever.'&quot;” (Exodus
32:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“It came about after these things that Joshua the son of Nun,
the servant of the LORD, died, being one hundred and ten years old.” (Joshua
24:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Jehovah: </b><b><span lang=HE dir=RTL>יהוה</span></b><span
dir=LTR></span><b><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(yehôvâh), YHWH,
the ineffable name. </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The etymology of this name is not preserved, but through
Exodus 3:14-15 we can trace the name to the root  <span lang=HE dir=RTL>הֲוָה</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span> Hawah (arc), or  <span
lang=HE dir=RTL>הָוָה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span>  Hayah
meaning be, become, come to pass. In Exodus 3:14-15, “I Am” is <span lang=HE
dir=RTL>היה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(hâyâh)
and means “I am being” or “that which I am.” Same word, same form. “I Am has
sent me to you.” Same word, same form. From this time on the name was used for
God, a personal name for God. </p>

<p class=Verses>“God said to Moses, &quot;I AM WHO I AM&quot;; and He said,
&quot;Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, 'I AM has sent me to
you.'&quot; God, furthermore, said to Moses, &quot;Thus you shall say to the
sons of Israel, 'The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God
of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you.' This is My name forever,
and this is My memorial-name to all generations.” (Exodus 3:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>But instead of the first common singular from Hayah, the
third masculine singular from Hawah was used. Thus the form <b><span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-size:14.0pt'>יהו</span></b><span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>ה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'><span dir=LTR></span> </span>YHWH. He
is, He exists. The concept in the name is personal everlasting existence,
being. Isaiah 43:10-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You are My witnesses,&quot; declares the LORD, &quot;And
My servant whom I have chosen, So that you may know and believe Me And
understand that I am He. Before Me there was no God formed, And there will be
none after Me. &quot;I, even I, am the LORD, And there is no savior besides
Me.” (Isaiah 43:10-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is the only personal name of God which was a personal
name from the beginning of its usage. There are other personal names but these
mostly have arisen from attributive titles for God. Jehovah will serve as a
vocabulary word, but we must understand from where it has arisen. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“In the name Jehovah, the personality of the supreme is
distinctly expressed. It is everywhere a proper name denoting the person of
God, and Him only. The Hebrew may say ‘the Elohim, the true God,’ in opposition
of all false gods, but never says ‘the Jehovah,’ for Jehovah is the name of the
true God only. He says again and again ‘my God,’ but never ‘my Jehovah,’ for
when he says ‘my God,’ he means Jehovah. He speaks of the God of Israel, but
never of the Jehovah of Israel, for there is no other Jehovah. He speaks of the
living God, but never of the living Jehovah, for he cannot conceive of Jehovah
as other than living.” <u>Girdlestone Synonyms of the Old Testament</u>. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jehovah very frequently occurs in compound with
Elohim...Jehovah Elohim. This name recognizes the personal name of the Godhead
in one name. Also, very often it is rendered, Jehovah Our, Your Elohim. Since
Jehovah refers to the personality of the Godhead, it is actually used for one
of the persons of the Godhead. The context will indicate whether it is the
first, second or third person. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We know that only the second person of the Trinity is the
revealed member so whenever Jehovah is revealed by seeing, communications, etc.
we know that the second person is in view. Jehovah also frequently occurs in
compound with Adonay, Adonay Jehovah, Lord Jehovah, or some places my Lord
Jehovah, Lord God. When this name is used we see the attitude of the speaker
toward Jehovah. An attitude of service and devotion, love and worship. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Some of the uses of Jehovah in Genesis</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jehovah is first
used in Genesis 2 where we find Jehovah Elohim creating man. It is the revealed
member of the Godhead who deals with mankind. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first real
contrast between Elohim and Jehovah is found in Genesis 3. Jehovah indicates
relationship with God. Satan does not use the name Jehovah. Eve is distracted
and ignores her relationship with Jehovah, and uses the name that Satan uses,
Elohim. This is generic and impersonal. It is Jehovah Elohim who then restored
fellowship and gave the first promise of a redeemer. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jehovah
recognized the tainted humanity that, angelic infiltration caused. Jehovah
determines to destroy all but Noah. Gen. 6:5-8. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great on the
earth, and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil
continually. The LORD was sorry that He had made man on the earth, and He was
grieved in His heart. The LORD said, &quot;I will blot out man whom I have
created from the face of the land, from man to animals to creeping things and
to birds of the sky; for I am sorry that I have made them.&quot; But Noah found
favor in the eyes of the LORD.” (Genesis 6:5-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When the time
comes for the flood, Jehovah gives the instructions and it is Jehovah who shuts
Noah in the ark. Gen. 7:16</p>

<p class=Verses>“So they went into the ark to Noah, by twos of all flesh in
which was the breath of life. Those that entered, male and female of all flesh,
entered as God had commanded him; and the LORD closed it behind him.” (Genesis
7:15-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jehovah makes
Abrahamic Covenant in Genesis 12. Jehovah destroys Sodom and Gomorrah in Genesis
19.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Angel of Jehovah </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We have seen
basically the significance of Jehovah. The Hebrew word for angel is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL>מָלַךְ</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>(mâlak), meaning messenger or representative. It is in the construct
relation. Almost all devout scholars agree that the Angel of Jehovah is the
preincarnate second person of the Godhead – the deity of Jesus Christ. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We must
determine the deity of the Angel of Jehovah and we must identify the Angel of
Jehovah with the revealed member of the Godhead. The best way is just to look
at some of the passages. It is clear in the English. Gen. 22:11-12; Joshua
5:13-15; Judges 6:11-24; Psalms 34:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the angel of the LORD called to him from heaven and said,
&quot;Abraham, Abraham!&quot; And he said, &quot;Here I am.&quot; He said,
&quot;Do not stretch out your hand against the lad, and do nothing to him; for
now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only
son, from Me.&quot;” (Genesis 22:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now it came about when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted
up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man was standing opposite him with his
sword drawn in his hand, and Joshua went to him and said to him, &quot;Are you
for us or for our adversaries?&quot; He said, &quot;No; rather I indeed come
now as captain of the host of the LORD.&quot; And Joshua fell on his face to
the earth, and bowed down, and said to him, &quot;What has my lord to say to
his servant?&quot; The captain of the LORD'S host said to Joshua, &quot;Remove
your sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is
holy.&quot; And Joshua did so.” (Joshua 5:13-15, NASB)</p>
