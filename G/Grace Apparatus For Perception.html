<h2><a name="_Grace_Apparatus_For"></a><a name="_D-Grace_Apparatus_For"></a>Grace
Apparatus For Perception</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Grace Apparatus for Perception is a grace system of
spiritual comprehension empowered by the filling of God the Holy Spirit where the
Holy Spirit controls the soul of the believer. The Holy Spirit’s power enables
the believer to understand, learn, and apply the whole realm of Bible doctrine,
the Word of God, regardless of the level of human intelligence or education. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Learning the Word and understanding it depends upon who
and what Jesus Christ is, not who and what we are. He has provided everything
necessary for taking in the Word and converting it to applicable <i>epignosis</i>
doctrine. The grace apparatus for perception was designed by God the Father in eternity
past to fulfill the purpose of learning doctrine by grace. Eph. 3:16-19; Job
32:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory,
to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inner man, so that
Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; and that you, being rooted and
grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the
breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ which
surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God.”
(Ephesians 3:16-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But it is a spirit in man, And the breath of the
Almighty gives them understanding.” (Job 32:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Church Age believer begins at salvation to learn all
that God has provided based on the saving work of Jesus Christ on the Cross.
The mechanism of spiritual learning takes the ignorant believer and enables
them to grow in grace and knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. 2 Peter 3:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory, both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.”
(2 Peter 3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are two categories of faith in learning the Word of
God, the mind of Christ - faith perception and faith application. Faith
perception is learning Bible doctrine. Faith application is taking the believed
Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the soul and applying it to life’s
situations and decisions. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Stages of the Grace Apparatus for Perception </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The stages of the grace apparatus for perception are:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Stage 1: Communication
of the Word of God by a pastor-teacher to his congregation using ICE
(Isagogics, Categories, Exegesis) principles of Hermeneutics.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Stage 2: Receptive
comprehension under the ministry of the Holy Spirit whereby the believer
understands the spiritual information (Bible doctrine) being taught by the
pastor-teacher. The Holy Spirit teaches the believer’s human spirit and then
transfers that academically understood spiritual information to the believer’s
left lobe of the soul as <i>gnosis</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Stage 3: Faith-perception
where God the Holy Spirit converts <i>gnosis</i> Bible doctrine into <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine and transfers that believed spiritual knowledge into the right
lobe of the soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Stage 4: Application
of <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine to life’s situations and decisions. <i>Epignosis</i>
doctrine is the only divine viewpoint that can be applied to life.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Stage 5: Spiritual
growth in the fulfillment of the plan of God for the believer’s life.  Only <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine results in spiritual growth and occupation with the person of
Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Stage 1</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>Stage 1 of the grace apparatus
for perception is the communication of the Word of God by a pastor-teacher to
his congregation using ICE (Isagogics, Categories, Exegesis) principles of
Hermeneutics. This communication can be in a local church to the assembled
believers or in non-face-to-face situations using available recording and communication
technology.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Isagogics is the basic principle of interpretation of the
Bible within the framework of its historical setting or prophetical
environment. The Bible must be interpreted in the framework of its own
historical setting, in the time in which it was written and in the original
languages in which it was written; i.e., Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. Isagogics
means that the pastor must become a biblical detective and interpret each verse
and passage by reconstructing the life and the customs of those ancient times
as they relate to the words and usage of the words in the Bible in the original
languages. The meaning of a word in the ancient languages is determined by its
usage.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Categories is categorical teaching by comparing Scripture
with Scripture to determine doctrinal classification. This is called categorical
teaching and must include consideration of dispensational theology. Without
dispensational theology, interpretation and application becomes confused and
fails to “accurately handle the Word of Truth.” A biblical subject may be
taught in a number of passages, but each one will add something that the other
does not. This involves tracing a subject through Scripture to determine more
information about that subject. 2 Tim. 2:15; Isaiah 28:10; Isaiah 28:13; 1 Cor
2:13-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman
who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth.” (2
Timothy 2:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For He says, 'Order on order, order on order, Line on
line, line on line, A little here, a little there.'&quot;” (Isaiah 28:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So the word of the LORD to them will be, &quot;Order on order,
order on order, Line on line, line on line, A little here, a little
there,&quot; That they may go and stumble backward, be broken, snared and taken
captive.” (Isaiah 28:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“which things we also speak, not in words taught by human
wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, combining spiritual thoughts with
spiritual words. But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of
God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because
they are spiritually appraised.” (1 Corinthians 2:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Exegesis is the analysis of the Bible verse by verse within
its grammar, syntax and etymology of the original languages. You cannot
correctly interpret Scripture from English translations; only from the original
languages. This analysis involves not only the verse itself, but the verse as
it relates to other verses in context. Grammar involves the features of a
language considered in all its parts - alphabet, tense, mood, and voice. Syntax
is putting together the features and the application of grammar so the pattern
and the precise meaning is readily understood. Etymology is how the word was
used at the time in which it was written.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The enabling power of God the Holy Spirit illuminates the
pastor-teacher so he will comprehend the doctrine he is studying. No pastor can
teach what he does not understand. Interpretation is the pastor's verbal
expression of Bible doctrine to the congregation under the enabling power of
the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In a public assembly in a local church or at Bible
classes, the communicator is a pastor-teacher. To an unbeliever, the
communicator may be any believer, or a believer with the spiritual gift of
evangelism. A Sunday School teacher is a communicator of Bible doctrine. Any
communicator must be filled with the Holy Spirit and the believer listening
must be filled with the Holy Spirit. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer must be motivated by positive volition to
hear the communication of Bible doctrine. They must be filled with the Holy
Spirit to learn and understand Bible doctrine being taught. Actually, the Holy
Spirit is teaching your human spirit and your pastor-teacher teaches you. The
believer must have focused concentration and self‑discipline. When you lose
your motivation, you lose your spiritual growth.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Stage 2</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Stage 2 of the grace apparatus for perception is receptive
comprehension under the ministry of the Holy Spirit whereby the believer understands
the spiritual information (Bible doctrine) being taught by the pastor-teacher. The
Holy Spirit teaches the believer’s human spirit and then transfers that
academically understood spiritually information to the believer’s left lobe of
the soul as <i>gnosis</i>.  The believer must be filled with the Spirit for the
Holy Spirit to be able to teach the human spirit. Eph. 3:18-19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the
breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ which
surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God.”
(Ephesians 3:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is taking knowledge (<i>gnosis</i>) into the mind (<i>nous</i>).
This will be head knowledge, it is not spiritually applicable. However, this
knowledge is a must because it must be perceived, understood, and then either
believed or rejected. The mind at this point is a staging area where either faith
or unbelief can be applied. 1 Cor. 2:14; 1 John 2:27; 1 Cor. 2:10; James 1:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of
God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because
they are spiritually appraised.” (1 Corinthians 2:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“As for you, the anointing which you received from Him abides
in you, and you have no need for anyone to teach you; but as His anointing
teaches you about all things, and is true and is not a lie, and just as it has
taught you, you abide in Him.” (1 John 2:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For to us God revealed them through the Spirit; for the Spirit
searches all things, even the depths of God.” (1 Corinthians 2:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is
like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror;” (James 1:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Receptive comprehension means that under the teaching ministry
of the Holy Spirit and with enough <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine already in
the right lobe’s frame of reference, you actually understand the doctrine being
taught.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Gnosis</i> information cannot result in spiritual
growth nor can it be applied to experience. <i>Gnosis</i> doctrine is waiting
for the believer’s faith to cause the Holy Spirit to convert it into <i>epignosis</i>.
When the unbeliever hears the Gospel, the Holy Spirit acts as a human spirit so
that the unbeliever can understand the spiritual information being communicated
– the issue of salvation, and exercise personal faith in Jesus Christ. There
are a few doctrines which an unbeliever can comprehend as purely academic information
such as the four divine institutions. Here, the Holy Spirit is not involved. It
is purely human comprehension and intelligence. An unbeliever can be patriotic,
can understand nationalism, can understand the function of marriage, family and
freedom. So also can a believer out of fellowship.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Positive volition and your attitude toward doctrine is
very important. This means you need to be objective to set aside anything that you
find disenchanting about the communicator such as his attire, how he speaks, or
his personality. You need enough objectivity to be able to focus on the
teaching.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Concentration enables you to give undivided attention to
the speaker without mental or overt distractions. Let’s say you have some
person who is in your line of vision whom you don’t like, whom you love, who
has a baby, or a stranger and you try to figure out who it is. You then lose
the continuity of the message. Some of you may get so tangled up with the personality
of the pastor-teacher that you don’t hear what is being taught. Some Bible
doctrine subjects will fascinate you, others will not.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Comprehension comes from positive volition and
concentration. It does not mean, however, that just because you are filled with
the Spirit that you understand everything the pastor says. For comprehension of
some advanced doctrines, you need a frame of reference filled with related
doctrines in order to understand them.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At this point you do not have to agree or disagree with
the Bible doctrine being taught. You only have to understand what is taught!
You may be suspicious of it. You may have never heard of it before (no frame of
reference). Your previous pastor may have never taught that doctrine. It may
sound completely new to you. Someone else may have taught something that was
different or you read something different in a book.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers may be suspicious of what is being taught. You
must first understand a doctrine before you can either accept it as truth or
reject it. Once you understand it, then you can make a decision.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are three reasons for negative volition. You may
have no frame of reference for it, so what you do not understand you disagree
with. You may have some personality involvement, teaching involvement or love
or loyalty for someone else who taught something that was different. Because of
your background, you disagree with what is being taught. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When positive volition is on the scene and expresses
itself, it will always be in a manner compatible with grace.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Human knowledge such as mathematics, chemistry, geography,
medicine, etc. can be understood without the human spirit and applied by the
perceptive or left lobe of the mentality of the soul to life’s situations. This
route of comprehension and application is only for non-spiritual information.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Stage 3</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>Stage 3 of the grace apparatus
for perception is the believer exercising faith belief or faith perception in
the spiritual</span> information understood academically (<i>gnosis</i>)
whereby the Holy Spirit transfers the believed doctrine to the right lobe of
the soul as <i>epignosis</i> doctrine. Here is the place from which Bible truth
is applied. Eph 6:14. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Stand firm therefore, HAVING GIRDED YOUR LOINS WITH TRUTH, and
HAVING PUT ON THE BREASTPLATE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS,” (Ephesians 6:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The mechanics of faith belief involve volition and faith.
Positive volition results in the formation of <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine
and its transfer by the Holy Spirit into the right lobe of the soul. Spiritual
truths must be first believed which triggers the Holy Spirit’s automatic
transfer to the right lobe of the soul as <i>epignosis</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Only <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine can be formed
categorically into doctrinal rationales for application. Only <i>epignosis</i> Bible
doctrine can be applied to life’s challenges and decisions. This stage is
critical to fulfilling the plan of God for your life, because only <i>epignosis</i>
doctrine can be used in application, causing one’s advance to spiritual
maturity.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Stage 4</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>Stage 4 of the grace apparatus
for perception is the application of <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine to life’s experiences,
situations, and decisions. <i>Epignosis</i> doctrine is the only divine
viewpoint that can be applied to life. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This accumulated <i>epignosis</i> doctrine in the right
lobe of the soul results in a doctrinal frame of reference or a spiritual IQ in
the believer’s soul. This believed doctrine is available for application to
life at a moment’s notice, if filled with the Holy Spirit. The purpose of the
frame of reference is the comprehension of more advanced doctrine. This also
results in the formation of a new spiritual conscience where divine norms and
standards are developed in the right lobe. You begin to look at life from the
divine viewpoint. This results in the production of divine good. 2 Cor. 10:5-6;
1 Cor. 2:12-13. </p>

<p class=Verses>“We are destroying speculations and every lofty thing raised up
against the knowledge of God, and we are taking every thought captive to the
obedience of Christ, and we are ready to punish all disobedience, whenever your
obedience is complete.” (2 Corinthians 10:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the
Spirit who is from God, so that we may know the things freely given to us by
God, which things we also speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in
those taught by the Spirit, combining spiritual thoughts with spiritual words.”
(1 Corinthians 2:12-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Stage 5</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>Stage 5 of the grace apparatus
for perception is spiritual growth in the fulfillment of the plan of God for
the believer’s life. Only <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine results in spiritual
growth and occupation with the person of Christ.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>As the believer grows
spiritually, the Holy Spirit is building an edification complex in the right
lobe of the believer’s soul. The</span> edification complex produce stabilized
biblical thinking. The only building material for this structure is <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/E/The%20Edification%20Complex%20of%20the%20Soul.html">The
Edification Complex of the Soul</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual growth is called the “renewing of your mind” in
Romans 12:2 and “be renewed in the spirit of your mind” in Ephesians 4:22-24.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by
the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that
which is good and acceptable and perfect.” (Romans 12:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“that, in reference to your former manner of life, you lay
aside the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of
deceit, and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind, and put on the new
self, which in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and
holiness of the truth.” (Ephesians 4:22-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual growth results in human viewpoint thinking
being replaced with divine viewpoint thinking which takes on more and more of
the thinking or mind of Jesus Christ. 1 Cor. 2:16; Eph. 4:25.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT
HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.” (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, laying aside falsehood, SPEAK TRUTH EACH ONE of you
WITH HIS NEIGHBOR, for we are members of one another.” (Ephesians 4:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual growth results in spiritual discernment with
less time spend mired in carnality with mental attitude sins. This also means
less and less room for false doctrine in the soul. You resolve more and more
problems using God's grace resources instead of relying on your human
abilities. Eph. 4:26-27.</p>

<p class=Verses>“BE ANGRY, AND yet DO NOT SIN; do not let the sun go down on
your anger, and do not give the devil an opportunity.” (Ephesians 4:26-27,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual growth provides discernment in quickly
recognizing false teaching. Your prayer content lines up more and more with
God's plan for your life. You are able to provide more accurate Gospel
information in ways understandable to the unbeliever during witnessing
opportunities.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Compartments of the Right Lobe of the Soul</b></p>

Bible doctrine are located in the right lobe of the mentality of the soul. They
