<h2>The Godhead</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Many terms in the Bible are language of accommodation. In
order to make the relationship of the Godhead understandable to the human race,
God (Elohim) decided to be called: God the Father, God the Son, and God the
Holy Spirit. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/T/The%20Trinity.html">The Trinity</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><img border=0 width=400 height=300 id="Picture 1"
src="The%20Godhead.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God the Father </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first member of the Godhead is called the Father. God
the Father is the planner. In eternity past, God the Father in His omniscience
designed a plan so comprehensive and perfect that it included all events of
angelic and human history including their related causes, conditions and
results. The Father design His plan so that His sovereignty would coexist with
the free will of His creatures. The Father also provided all of the grace means
for all of His creatures to completely fulfill His plan for each and every one
of them based solely on their free will.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Father provided for the humanity of the Lord
Jesus Christ in His earthly ministry. Believers call Him the Father because He
is the planner and provider of both eternal salvation and for grace resources
to live the spiritual life. God the Father planned salvation according to Isaiah
14:24, Isaiah 14:27, John 12:44, and Ephesians 3:11. See category on <a
href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/G/God%20the%20Father.html">God the Father</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD of hosts has sworn saying, “Surely, just as I have
intended so it has happened, and just as I have planned so it will stand,” 
(Isaiah 14:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““For the LORD of hosts has planned, and who can frustrate it?
And as for His stretched-out hand, who can turn it back?”“  (Isaiah 14:27,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And Jesus cried out and said, “He who believes in Me, does not
believe in Me but in Him who sent Me.”  (John 12:44, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“This was in accordance with the eternal purpose which He
carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord,”  (Ephesians 3:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God the Son</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The second member of the Godhead is called the Son. Jesus
Christ is the only visible member of the Godhead. John 6:46; 1 Tim 3:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Not that anyone has seen the Father, except the One who is
from God; He has seen the Father.”  (John 6:46, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“By common confession, great is the mystery of godliness: He
who was revealed in the flesh, Was vindicated in the Spirit, Seen by angels,
Proclaimed among the nations, Believed on in the world, Taken up in glory.”  (1
Timothy 3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is also the creator of the universe. Psalms
102:25. </p>

<p class=Verses>““Of old You founded the earth, And the heavens are the work of
Your hands.”  (Psalms 102:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ (God the Son - the deity of the Lord Jesus
Christ) obeyed the plan of the Father in order to provide salvation. Eph.
1:11-12; John 3:16-17; Rom. 8:31-32.</p>

<p class=Verses>“also we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined
according to His purpose who works all things after the counsel of His will, to
the end that we who were the first to hope in Christ would be to the praise of
His glory.”  (Ephesians 1:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten
Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life. “For
God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world
might be saved through Him.”  (John 3:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who
is against us? He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him over for us
all, how will He not also with Him freely give us all things?”  (Romans
8:31-32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the hypostatic union, He became obedience unto death
and executed the Father’s plan to provide salvation for the human race. Phil.
2:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by
becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.”  (Philippians
2:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ was declared by God the Father as the heir
of all things in Hebrews 1:2. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/G/God%20the%20Son.html">God the
Son</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“in these last days has spoken to us in His Son, whom He
appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the world.”  (Hebrews
1:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God the Holy Spirit </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The third member of the Godhead is called the Holy
Spirit. God the Holy Spirit reveals the plan of the Father and the message of
salvation to the world. While He is never visible to humanity, He reveals God
to humanity by making the Gospel clear in His convicting ministry. He convicts
the unbeliever of their unbelief and makes clear the issue of acceptance or
rejection of Jesus Christ’s unlimited atonement for mankind’s sins on the Cross.
John 16:8-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>““And He, when He comes, will convict the world concerning sin
and righteousness and judgment; concerning sin, because they do not believe in
Me; and concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father and you no longer
see Me; and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been
judged.”  (John 16:8-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Holy Spirit is also the mentor, teacher and
encourager of every believer and produces the unseen enabling power to live the
spiritual life. 2 Tim. 1:13-14; John 14:26. See category on <a
href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/G/God%20the%20Holy%20Spirit.html">God the Holy Spirit</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Retain the standard of sound words which you have heard from
me, in the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus. Guard, through the Holy
Spirit who dwells in us, the treasure which has been entrusted to you.”  (2
Timothy 1:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in
My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I
said to you.”  (John 14:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When distinctions are made regarding the Godhead, they
are always in reference to the function or operation of a specific member of
the Godhead.</p>
