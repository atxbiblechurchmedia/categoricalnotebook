<h2><a name="_D-God’s_Justice"></a>God’s Justice</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The justice of God is that infinitely righteous
perfection of God’s essence whereby He perfectly governs His creation. God has
imposed righteous laws on all His created beings. God’s perfectly fair justice
judges all deviations from His laws. God’s justice is an unchangeable and
intrinsic principle of His very essence. God demands conformity in all respects
to His righteous laws. The justice of God acts as a watchdog of His perfect and
unchangeable attributes and strictly protects them from compromise.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All created beings have been given a free will by God and
are thus accountable to their Creator for their decisions and actions. For
created beings whose free will decisions result in sin, God’s righteousness
condemns those decisions as disobedience against His perfect and righteous
laws. His justice then immutably and impartially administers the penalty that
His righteousness demands. God has always been and will always be the only
perfectly fair judge. Deut. 32:4; 2 Chron. 19:7; Psalms 19:9; Psalms 89:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;The Rock! His work is perfect, For all His ways are
just; A God of faithfulness and without injustice, Righteous and upright is
He.&quot;  (Deuteronomy 32:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Now then let the fear of the LORD be upon you; be
very careful what you do, for the LORD our God will have no part in
unrighteousness or partiality or the taking of a bribe.&quot;&quot;  (2
Chronicles 19:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring forever; The
judgments of the LORD are true; they are righteous altogether.&quot;  (Psalms
19:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your
throne; Lovingkindness and truth go before You.&quot;  (Psalms 89:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Demands of God’s Justice</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is the perfect judge. As the perfect judge, He places
a penalty on sin. Perfect justice demands a penalty. Psalms 50:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the heavens declare His righteousness, For God Himself is
judge. Selah.”  (Psalms 50:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God demands that disobedience against His laws be
punished. Deut. 18:18-19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“‘I will raise up a prophet from among their countrymen like
you, and I will put My words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that
I command him. ‘It shall come about that whoever will not listen to My words
which he shall speak in My name, I Myself will require it of him.” 
(Deuteronomy 18:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The result of the unpaid penalty of sin is spiritual
death. Rom. 6:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is
eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.”  (Romans 6:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Satisfaction of God’s Justice</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s justice is satisfied because of God’s grace
provision whereby Jesus Christ paid the penalty for all of mankind’s sins on
the Cross. Col. 2:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“having canceled out the certificate of debt consisting of
decrees against us, which was hostile to us; and He has taken it out of the
way, having nailed it to the cross.”  (Colossians 2:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The person of Jesus Christ satisfied the absolute
righteousness (+R) of God. The work of Jesus Christ satisfied the justice of
God. 2 Cor. 5:21; Isaiah 53:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that
we might become the righteousness of God in Him.”  (2 Corinthians 5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“As a result of the anguish of His soul, He will see it and be
satisfied; By His knowledge the Righteous One, My Servant, will justify the
many, As He will bear their iniquities.”  (Isaiah 53:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Therefore, God is just to forgive the individual who uses
positive volition and accepts the work of Jesus Christ. For them there is no
condemnation. Rom. 8:1; 1 John 5:11-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in
Christ Jesus.”  (Romans 8:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the testimony is this, that God has given us eternal life,
and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has the life; he who does not
have the Son of God does not have the life.”  (1 John 5:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is just to condemn the individual who uses negative
volition and rejects the work of Jesus Christ. John 3:18; John 3:36.</p>

<p class=Verses>““He who believes in Him is not judged; he who does not believe
has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only
begotten Son of God.”  (John 3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who does
not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.”“ 
(John 3:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Grace always precedes judgment. From 420 BC to 400 BC was
a time when Malachi, in a period of grace, preached the Word. They got with it!
Malachi 1:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The oracle of the word of the LORD to Israel through Malachi.
“I have loved you,” says the LORD. But you say, “How have You loved us?” “Was
not Esau Jacob’s brother?” declares the LORD. “Yet I have loved Jacob;” 
(Malachi 1:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Divine Justice and His Creation </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For created beings whose free will decisions result in
strict adherence to His laws, God’s righteousness always approves of the
action. His justice then immutably administers the blessing that His
righteousness demands. James 1:12; 2 Tim. 4:8; 2 Tim. 2:13. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Blessed is a man who perseveres under trial; for once he
has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has
promised to those who love Him.&quot;  (James 1:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;in the future there is laid up for me the crown of
righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that
day; and not only to me, but also to all who have loved His appearing.&quot; 
(2 Timothy 4:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot
deny Himself.&quot;  (2 Timothy 2:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has absolute dominion over all of His created beings.
He is absolute law. He is the perfectly righteous governor and judge of all
that exists. He judges all that fails to conform to His perfect and
unchangeable righteousness. All judgments He pronounces and blessings He
conveys are perfect and just. It is impossible for God to render an incorrect
decision or to unfairly administer punishment. God’s perfect omniscience
insures that His judgments are fair and impartial. Psalms 36:6; Acts 10:34;
Rom. 2:11; Rev. 16:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Your righteousness is like the mountains of God; Your
judgments are like a great deep. O LORD, You preserve man and beast.&quot; 
(Psalms 36:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Opening his mouth, Peter said: &quot;I most certainly
understand now that God is not one to show partiality,&quot;  (Acts 10:34,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For there is no partiality with God.&quot;  (Romans 2:11,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And I heard the altar saying, &quot;Yes, O Lord God, the
Almighty, true and righteous are Your judgments.&quot;&quot;  (Revelation 16:7,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Justification From Christ’s Redemptive Work on The
Cross</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divine justice is most clearly evident in the redemptive
work of Jesus Christ on the Cross for all of mankind. The justice of God must
punish all who sin. Sin is defined as all thoughts or actions that fall short
of the perfect standard of God’s righteousness. Since all of mankind are born
into sin through Adam (except for the virgin birth of Jesus Christ), the
justice of God must punish all of mankind for their sins. That is, of course,
unless there is a perfectly qualified person who is willing to be their
substitute. In order to qualify, that substitute would have to be both
perfectly sinless man and possess a righteousness equal to God’s perfect
righteousness. Moreover, for the substitution to be fair, that substitute would
have to do so willingly and without any type of coercion. Jesus Christ was that
perfectly qualified substitute for all of mankind. For this to be acceptable,
the justice of God would have had to be satisfied with that work. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s satisfaction with Christ’s work on the Cross is
called justification. You cannot earn or deserve your justification.
Justification means to be declared righteous in the sight of God. God’s perfect
love found a way to provide grace blessing to sinful mankind without
compromising His perfect attributes. Now, the only issue is acceptance of Jesus
Christ’s atonement for your sins. Rejection of this grace work means that
judgment will remain. Rom. 8:1; John 3:18; John 3:36; Rom. 3:24-26.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are
in Christ Jesus.&quot;  (Romans 8:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;He who believes in Him is not judged; he who does
not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of
the only begotten Son of God. &quot;  (John 3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he
who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on
him.&quot;&quot;  (John 3:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;being justified as a gift by His grace through the
redemption which is in Christ Jesus; whom God displayed publicly as a
propitiation in His blood through faith. This was to demonstrate His
righteousness, because in the forbearance of God He passed over the sins
previously committed; for the demonstration, I say, of His righteousness at the
present time, so that He would be just and the justifier of the one who has
faith in Jesus.&quot;  (Romans 3:24-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God's justice was satisfied because of His grace
provision of redemption. The Lord Jesus Christ, through his substitutionary
spiritual death on the Cross, transferred the guilt of all sinners onto Himself
(Unlimited Atonement), thus satisfying the justice of God. God is now free to
pardon the sinner and justify the ones who accepts His saving grace. Conversely,
God must continue to justly condemn all who reject His perfect grace gift of
salvation. Rom. 6:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God
is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.&quot;  (Romans 6:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The basis of the unbeliever’s indictment and resultant
eternal condemnation will be their imperfect works of human good. God cannot
ever again condemn any human beings because of their sins. Jesus Christ paid
the penalty that God’s righteousness demanded for all of mankind’s sins – even
for those people who would reject that perfect substitutionary payment. Eternal
condemnation will always be for their rejection of Jesus Christ as Savior –
never for sins. Col. 2:14; 1 Peter 2:24.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;having canceled out the certificate of debt consisting of
decrees against us, which was hostile to us; and He has taken it out of the
way, having nailed it to the cross.&quot;  (Colossians 2:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, so
that we might die to sin and live to righteousness; for by His wounds you were
healed.&quot;  (1 Peter 2:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ as the lamb of God was qualified to go to
the Cross because He remained perfectly sinless in His humanity throughout His
entire 33 years on earth. He remained in fellowship with God the Holy Spirit
the entire time. He remained, in His humanity, sinless while on the Cross
voluntarily accepting the imputation of all of our sins to His body from the
omnipotence of God the Father. He continued to remain sinless even while
enduring the unimaginable punishment from the justice of God the Father for all
of those sins. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The humanity of Jesus Christ voluntarily received the
punishment deserved by all of the rest of the human race. He was our perfect
substitute. There never has been a sin committed in the history of the human
race which was not judged on the Cross. This is unlimited atonement. That is
why anyone who believes in the work of Jesus Christ will never perish, but will
have eternal life. The decision from the justice of God to judge our sins on
the Cross is the basis for our eternal salvation. Rom. 5:6; 2 Cor. 5:19; 1 Tim.
2:6; 1 John 2:2; John 3:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For while we were still helpless, at the right time
Christ died for the ungodly.&quot;  (Romans 5:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;namely, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to
Himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and He has committed to us
the word of reconciliation.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 5:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;who gave Himself as a ransom for all, the testimony given
at the proper time.&quot;  (1 Timothy 2:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins; and not
for ours only, but also for those of the whole world.&quot;  (1 John 2:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;For God so loved the world, that He gave His only
begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal
life. &quot;  (John 3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God's perfect righteousness demands perfectly fair
judgment for all sin. All sins had to be judged on the Cross. The justice and
righteousness of God were Jesus Christ’s points of contact with God the Father
while on the Cross. His humanity had to be judged for our sins. This was His
purpose for being on earth. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Father presented the humanity of Jesus Christ as
a sacrifice for our sins. He was there for us, as a perfect atonement for the
sins of the entire human race. How does this benefit us eternally? Only through
faith belief in Christ’s work on our behalf. Nothing more. Nothing less. God
the Father did this to demonstrate His justice, His fairness to all.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The issue in salvation is divine justice accepted or
rejected. You get divine justice sooner or later. You get it sooner by
believing in Christ. You get it later by rejection of Christ. Sin is not the
issue in salvation, justice is. Because of propitiation, God is now free to
pardon and justify sinful humanity who appropriates the saving grace of God by
faith in Christ. God is free to save those who believe because of His justice.
The basis for the unbeliever's indictment at the Last Judgment is evil and human
good, not sin. Rev. 20:12-15.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing
before the throne, and books were opened; and another book was opened, which is
the book of life; and the dead were judged from the things which were written
in the books, according to their deeds. And the sea gave up the dead which were
in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them; and they were
judged, every one of them according to their deeds. Then death and Hades were
thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire. And
if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into
the lake of fire.&quot;  (Revelation 20:12-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Fairness of God’s Justice</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The justice of God is absolute and perfect fairness. It
is impossible for God to be unfair in how He administers justice. God's justice
administers divine laws which are compatible with His perfect justice,
righteousness, and sovereignty.  Divine justice is the function of eternal God
as the judge of mankind, rendering daily decisions with regard to all members
of the human race.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is one thing in life that you can count on. Life
will not always be fair as this is the devil’s world. As such, in dealing with
others in life, they will never be 100% fair, even in a good system. All people
have sinful natures which means that things will not always go your way and
that things will happen to you that are not fair. The spiritual life under the
enabling power of the Holy Spirit enables the believer to rise above this
unfairness and keep a relaxed mental attitude while doing so. Only in this way,
through the grace of God can you focus on the one fair point of contact in your
life – God’s perfect fairness. God is perfect in justice. Isaiah 45:21; Psalms 89:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Declare and set forth your case; Indeed, let them consult
together. Who has announced this from of old? Who has long since declared it?
Is it not I, the LORD? And there is no other God besides Me, A righteous God
and a Savior; There is none except Me.”  (Isaiah 45:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne;
Lovingkindness and truth go before You.”  (Psalms 89:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is absolutely fair and impartial. 2 Chron. 19:7; Rom.
3:26; Rev. 15:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Now then let the fear of the LORD be upon you; be very
careful what you do, for the LORD our God will have no part in unrighteousness
or partiality or the taking of a bribe.”“  (2 Chronicles 19:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“for the demonstration, I say, of His righteousness at the
present time, so that He would be just and the justifier of the one who has
faith in Jesus.”  (Romans 3:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And they sang the song of Moses, the bond-servant of God, and
the song of the Lamb, saying, “Great and marvelous are Your works, O Lord God,
the Almighty; Righteous and true are Your ways, King of the nations!” 
(Revelation 15:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has the absolute right and authority over His
creatures by virtue of creation. God in His absolute sovereignty has the
perfect right to dispose of His works as it may please Him. Psalms 115:3; Psalms
135:6. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But our God is in the heavens; He does whatever He pleases.” 
(Psalms 115:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Whatever the LORD pleases, He does, In heaven and in earth, in
the seas and in all deeps.”  (Psalms 135:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God in His absolute righteousness (+R), gave good and
righteous laws to man. Perfect righteousness demands perfect righteousness.
Gen. 2:17; John 14:6; Rom. 3:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall
not eat, for in the day that you eat from it you will surely die.”“  (Genesis
2:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life;
no one comes to the Father but through Me.”  (John 14:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,” 
(Romans 3:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are all personally responsible for our own decisions
in life. This is our free will in action that God has promised that He will
never coerce in any way. God decreed in eternity past that His sovereignty
would operate in perfect compatibility with the free will of His created
beings. Whenever you do not like what is happening to you, just remember that
God is always fair.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If you have made bad decisions, then you are going to
suffer the consequences. The justice of God administers the penalties and
decisions demanded by His perfect righteousness.  If you react with bitterness,
vindictiveness, hatred, pettiness, jealousy, or any other mental attitude sin,
that is the worst thing that you can do. If you want to have an unhappy life,
all you have to do is to seek vengeance, be vindictive or seek to hurt someone
else. The result will be that you will be the one who will be hurt. The justice
of God does not need any help in dealing with the unfairness and injustices in
the world that come our way.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Unless you have a clear understanding of the attributes
of God, you are never going to have any true thanksgiving or gratefulness for
anything that God does for you. If you do not have the capacity for
thanksgiving, you do not have the capacity to love anyone except yourself.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Examples of God’s Justice</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s perfect justice gives everyone an opportunity to be
saved even though in His foreknowledge He knew that not all would not accept
Jesus Christ as Savior. He didn’t use His foreknowledge to be unfair.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Example #1: Pharaoh</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Pharaoh went negative towards the Gospel. Exodus 8:32.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and he did not
let the people go.”  (Exodus 8:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Exodus 14:8, God took the stops off of Pharaoh’s
negative volition. God kept putting more and more information in the form of
plagues (miracles) in front of Pharaoh and he kept going on negative signals.
Plagues were evangelism to Pharaoh and others. The mixed multitude that left
Egypt included believers of other nationalities than Jewish, who were saved
because of this evangelism. Exodus 14:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and he
chased after the sons of Israel as the sons of Israel were going out boldly.” 
(Exodus 14:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Holy Spirit has a restraining influence or ministry
insofar as negative volition is concerned in the world. The reason the
Tribulation will be so horrible is that the restraining ministry of the Holy
Spirit will be removed until the Second Advent of Jesus Christ. 2 Thess. 2:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only he who
now restrains will do so until he is taken out of the way.”  (2 Thessalonians
2:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Example #2: Judas Iscariot</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Even though, in His omniscience, God knew that Judas
would reject Him, He allowed Judas to become a disciple. Even though, in His
omniscience, God knew Judas would be dishonest, He didn’t say “no” when the
disciples elected Judas to be the treasurer of their traveling group.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All the evangelism passages in the Sermon on the Mount
were for the express benefit of Judas, and he still rejected. Man has free
will. Christ never coerced Judas’ volition. God is always fair, and just! Judas
felt remorse for his sin (<span lang=EL>μεταμε</span>́<span lang=EL>λλομαι</span>
(metamellomai means remorse in the Greek, not <span lang=EL>μετανοε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (metanoeō) which means repentance). He even made restitution
by giving the money back to the Jewish leaders, but he committed suicide never
having accepted Jesus Christ as Savior. Matt. 27:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then when Judas, who had betrayed Him, saw that He had been
condemned, he felt remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the
chief priests and elders, saying, “I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.”
But they said, “What is that to us? See to that yourself!” And he threw the
pieces of silver into the temple sanctuary and departed; and he went away and
hanged himself.”  (Matthew 27:3-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Fairness of God’s Love</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As you grow spiritually, you will come to love God
personally more and more because of who and what He is. Based on that love and
the enabling power of the Holy Spirit, you can be fair to others regardless of
their actions. You can be fair to them unconditionally (unconditional love)
based on the Bible doctrine in your soul and because you are treating them as
Jesus Christ would. By doing so, you are thinking with the mind of Christ. Matt.
7:12; 1 Cor. 2:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;In everything, therefore, treat people the same
way you want them to treat you, for this is the Law and the Prophets. &quot; 
(Matthew 7:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL
INSTRUCT HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is perfectly fair with all of His creation all of the
time. There are no exceptions. Ever. If we feel we are being treated unfairly,
it is not because of how God is treating us. It may because of how others treat
us, but never God. His plan for your life is a perfect plan that is perfectly
fair in all ways. God is fair to us based on His omniscience. He knows
everything about everything. God treats us fairly at all times even when He has
to discipline us when we have sinned and have not yet confessed those sins to
Him. All He wants is for us to admit that we have sinned and confess those sins
and be restored to the filling of the Holy Spirit. Only then can we learn more
about Him and His plan for us through Bible doctrine. Even when we come under
severe divine discipline, it is from His love so that we will wake up and get
back into functioning according to His plan. This is the expression of His love
and His justice.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God’s Love Toward Us</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>From the time of our physical birth until we believe in
Jesus Christ, we are the objects of God's unconditional love. His unconditional
love emphasizes God’s integrity and our complete unworthiness. When we are
born, we are spiritually dead, we are in total depravity, we are completely
separated from God, and totally helpless to do anything about it. Rom. 5:8.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that
while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.&quot;  (Romans 5:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Once we personally believe in Jesus Christ, we become the
objects of God's personal love. This is because His has already imputed His
perfect righteousness to us at the point of salvation.  Since personal love
emphasizes the worthiness of the one that is loved, God's personal love is
always directed toward our imputed divine righteousness. However, the justice
of God continues to be our point of reference. The justice of God is what keeps
us alive in this, the devil's world. However, God's impersonal and personal
love are only motivating factors in our relationship with Him. The justice of
God is always our point of contact.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God’s Court in Heaven</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is a perfect court in heaven where Jesus Christ is
the judge and where all judgments are rendered perfectly and with perfect
fairness. It is the last court of appeals in history, as well as the court for
personal justice for the individual believer. It is a court which administers
both personal and collective justice. John 5:22; John 5:27.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;For not even the Father judges anyone, but He has
given all judgment to the Son, &quot;  (John 5:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; and He gave Him authority to execute judgment, because
He is the Son of Man. &quot;  (John 5:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This court of heaven fulfills the principle that Jesus
Christ controls history. This court has the highest jurisdiction and overrules
Satan's authority as the ruler of this world. Satan has always been subject to
this court. In this court, many of Satan's plans and policies have been set
aside, overruled, and reversed. It is to this court that King Hezekiah appealed
to Isaiah for intercessory prayer in Isaiah 37:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;'Perhaps the LORD your God will hear the words of
Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to reproach the living
God, and will rebuke the words which the LORD your God has heard. Therefore,
offer a prayer for the remnant that is left.'&quot;&quot;  (Isaiah 37:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is why God’s perfect plan for mankind continues to
unfold exactly as He planned it in eternity past. History continues in spite of
the fact that Satan is the ruler of this world. Jesus Christ is the perfect
judge of human history. In the rise and fall of nations, there are no
accidents, prejudice, or favoritism. There is only the function of perfect
divine justice consistent with the free will of man.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the court of heaven are three equally perfect judges: 
God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. The court of heaven is
the highest court in the universe where God hears cases related to evil in the
world, sinfulness and injustice in human affairs, the rise and fall of nations,
anti-Semitism, conflicts among believers, satanic accusations against
believers, and divine discipline of believers. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The decisions of the court of heaven are always
compatible with God's perfect righteousness.  God is a wise, incorruptible,
perfect, and fair judge of mankind. He has never rendered a wrong decision. In
all the uncountable trillions of decisions God has rendered, not one has ever
been unfair or incorrect. It is impossible for perfect God to render an
imperfect decision as judge. Job 37:23; Psalms 19:9.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;The Almighty—we cannot find Him; He is exalted in
power And He will not do violence to justice and abundant righteousness.&quot; 
(Job 37:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring forever; The
judgments of the LORD are true; they are righteous altogether.&quot;  (Psalms
19:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Jesus Christ as the Perfect Judge</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The uniqueness of Jesus Christ as the highest court judge
has to do with His hypostatic union - the unity of His undiminished deity and
perfect human nature. In His glorified state, the resurrected humanity of
Christ resides at the right hand of God the Father. In that position, He
functions as the highest judge in heaven and as our high priest to the Church
where He makes intersession for believers. John 5:22-23; John 5:27.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;For not even the Father judges anyone, but He has
given all judgment to the Son, so that all will honor the Son even as they
honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who
sent Him. &quot;  (John 5:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; and He gave Him authority to execute judgment, because
He is the Son of Man. &quot;  (John 5:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ as the Son of Man emphasizes His hypostatic
union and the hypostatic union emphasizes the substitutionary judgment of our
Lord for the sins of mankind on the Cross. The judgment of our Lord on the Cross
qualifies Him to be the highest judge in heaven and to represent us personally
as our defense attorney. He presides on the bench in historical judgments involving
the believer’s self-judgment, judgment of the believer's divine good production
following the Rapture at the Judgment Seat of Christ, judgment of the Jewish
and Gentile Tribulational believers at the Second Advent (the Baptism of Fire),
judgment of all unbelievers of the human race at the end of the Millennium (the
Great White Throne Judgment), and judgment of Satan and all fallen angels at
the end of the Millennium (the Great White Throne Judgment).</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The deity of Jesus Christ is perfect and eternal God
complete with all equal attributes possessed by God the Father and God the Holy
Spirit. This possession of perfect righteousness and perfect justice makes Him
qualified to function as a justice of the court of heaven. Jesus Christ judges
based on the combination of His perfect divine essence and His perfect
resurrected humanity. This means that the integrity and capability of our Lord
to preside in the court of heaven is one of eternal and infinite qualifications.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Because our Lord is also omniscient, His perfect deity
and perfect humanity make His judgments beyond reproach. Since He knew every
fact there is to know in eternity past before He created anything, He knows
with perfect clarity and without bias all the facts of every case. His
judgments are always made in perfect and eternal wisdom. He judges every case
with perfect fairness, totally without prejudice or any form of partiality.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Jesus Christ As Our Advocate</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ also functions as our advocate in the court
of heaven for the believer. 1 John 2:1-2. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;My little children, I am writing these things to you so
that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father,
Jesus Christ the righteous; and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins;
and not for ours only, but also for those of the whole world.&quot;  (1 John
2:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer continues to sin after salvation. 1 John
1:8-10.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves
and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and
righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If
we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar and His word is not in
us.&quot;  (1 John 1:8-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan is aware of our sins and periodically, accuses
believers before the court of heaven to serve his own purposes or to attempt to
thwart the plan of God. Job 1:6-12.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present
themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them. The LORD said to
Satan, &quot;From where do you come?&quot; Then Satan answered the LORD and
said, &quot;From roaming about on the earth and walking around on it.&quot; The
LORD said to Satan, &quot;Have you considered My servant Job? For there is no
one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, fearing God and turning
away from evil.&quot; Then Satan answered the LORD, &quot;Does Job fear God for
nothing? &quot;Have You not made a hedge about him and his house and all that
he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his
possessions have increased in the land. &quot;But put forth Your hand now and
touch all that he has; he will surely curse You to Your face.&quot; Then the
LORD said to Satan, &quot;Behold, all that he has is in your power, only do not
put forth your hand on him.&quot; So Satan departed from the presence of the
LORD.&quot;  (Job 1:6-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Whenever Satan accuses a believer in the court of heaven,
Jesus Christ acts as our advocate resulting in the accusation being thrown out
because He already paid the penalty for the sin on the Cross. Zech. 3:1-2.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before
the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him. The
LORD said to Satan, &quot;The LORD rebuke you, Satan! Indeed, the LORD who has
chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is this not a brand plucked from the
fire?&quot;&quot;  (Zechariah 3:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All sins were judged once and for all on the Cross and
cannot be judged again by God the Father. Therefore, He cannot judge the same
sin twice. Rom. 6:10. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For the death that He died, He died to sin once for all;
but the life that He lives, He lives to God.&quot;  (Romans 6:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>However, the sins of the believer become a family matter
for administration of divine discipline. Heb. 12:6.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;FOR THOSE WHOM THE LORD LOVES HE DISCIPLINES, AND HE
SCOURGES EVERY SON WHOM HE RECEIVES.&quot;&quot;  (Hebrews 12:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Application of God’s Justice</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You must understand that the justice of God is our point
of contact. God is fair to the entire human race because He provided, through
Jesus Christ, eternal salvation for the entire human race. Since God is always
fair, all human beings will have a chance to accept God’s free grace gift of
eternal salvation. Also, following acceptance of Jesus Christ as your Savior,
God will continue to be perfectly fair toward us – always. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s justice is the source of all blessing, discipline,
testing, judgment, and punishment. God’s perfect justice and righteousness have
always existed and are incorruptible. There is nothing man can do to corrupt
the justice and righteousness of God. God's righteousness is the guardian of
God's justice. Justice guards the rest of the attributes of God. Mankind’s self-righteousness,
sinfulness, good deeds, or morality cannot influence the righteousness or
justice of God.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s perfect attributes have always remained
incorruptible throughout eternity past and into the eternal future without help
from any angel or human at any time. God does not need our help. We need His
help. This recognition is called humility. Our help comes from the imputation
of blessing from the justice of God to His indwelling righteousness. The
correct application of the essence of God rationale is that all help and all
blessing come from the justice of God to the righteousness in us.</p>
