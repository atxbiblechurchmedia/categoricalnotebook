<h2>Grace in Operation</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God in His sovereignty decided in eternity past to treat
man in grace. Eph. 3:11; Eph. 2:8-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“This was in accordance with the eternal purpose which He
carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord,” (Ephesians 3:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not
of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one
may boast.” (Ephesians 2:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God's grace can only express itself in love and eternal
life because His love is the motivator of grace. God does not ignore the rest
of His character when He expresses grace. Absolute righteousness and justice
stood in the way because sin stood like a wall or barrier between God and man. God’s
absolute righteousness (+R) cannot have fellowship with man’s relative
righteousness (-R). God’s justice demands a penalty for sin. Rom. 6:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is
eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Romans 6:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The penalty for sin is spiritual death which is no
fellowship with God. Adam and Eve sinned and died spiritually. They were
incapable of having fellowship with God. Gen. 2:17; Gen. 3:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall
not eat, for in the day that you eat from it you will surely die.&quot;”
(Genesis 2:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“They heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in
the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence
of the LORD God among the trees of the garden.” (Genesis 3:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The human race is born spiritually dead due to imputation
of Adam’s original sin. Rom. 5:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world,
and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned—”
(Romans 5:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In His love, God sent His Son to the Cross to die
spiritually for the sins of the whole world. On the Cross, Jesus Christ paid
the penalty of sin for all of mankind through His substitutionary spiritual
death. In doing so, He removed the sin barrier. John 3:16; 1 John 2:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For God so loved the world, that He gave His only
begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal
life.” (John 3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins; and not for
ours only, but also for those of the whole world.” (1 John 2:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God cannot just love the human race and ignore His absolute
righteousness (+R) and perfect justice. The work of the Lord Jesus Christ
satisfied the absolute righteousness (+R) of God. The work of the Lord Jesus
Christ on the Cross satisfied the justice of God, making provision for
salvation. So God’s love and eternal life are free to be imputed to the
believer at salvation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Now, the only barrier between man and God is the volition
of every person ever born. You either believe in the work of the Lord Jesus
Christ for your sins or you reject that grace provision. If you don’t receive
Christ satisfying the absolute righteousness (+R)  and justice of God, then you
are subject to His justice.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Grace always depends upon the character of the person,
not on the merits of another. Inherent character depends on what you think, not
what appears on the outside. When a believer operates under grace, they fulfill
the Christian way of life. The believer forgives as Jesus Christ forgave, loves
others unconditionally (<i>agapao</i> love), has no illusion about human
ability, and relies entirely upon God's grace resources to live the spiritual
life. The believer must have <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the right lobe
of their soul to be able to orient to God's grace.</p>
