<h2><a name="_D-Grace"></a>Grace</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Grace is all that God is free to do for man on the basis
of the Cross, therefore grace is the plan and work of God on behalf of man.
Grace is the policy of God’s plan. God provides all. Grace depends upon the
character of God. God's grace depends upon who and what God is and what He can
do for man and still be consistent with His own perfect character.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We have seen that the term grace speaks of the work of
God on behalf of man apart from man’s ability or merit. As such, the grace of
God depends upon who and what God is, never on man’s ability or talent. The
greatest thing God can do for you is to make you exactly like His Son, Jesus
Christ. This is accomplished by redemption, spirituality, and spiritual growth.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is perfect and His plan is perfect. A perfect plan
can only originate from a perfect God. If man can do anything meritorious in
the plan of God, it is no longer perfect. A plan is no stronger than its
weakest link. For this reason, grace excludes human merit, all human ability
and human talent. Human good, legalism, and human works are the enemy of grace.
The works of human righteousness, therefore, have no place in the plan of God.
All human good is associated with the mental attitude sin of pride.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer must sort out the difference between grace
and legalism. Legalism is man doing the work and God is supposed to accept it
and bless it. Grace is God doing the work and man accepts it and God gets the
glory.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At salvation, God the Holy Spirit places every believer
in union with Jesus Christ. This is called Positional Sanctification. 2 Cor
5:17; Hebrews 1; Hebrews 2; 1 Peter 2:2-3. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creature; the
old things passed away; behold, new things have come.” (2 Corinthians 5:17,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“like newborn babies, long for the pure milk of the word, so
that by it you may grow in respect to salvation, if you have tasted the
kindness of the Lord.” (1 Peter 2:2-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At salvation, every Church Age believer receives 40
things from God. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/S/The%2040%20Things%20Received%20at%20Salvation.html">The 40 Things
Received at Salvation</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer growing to spiritual maturity through intake
and application of Bible doctrine and the resultant construction of the
edification complex of the soul is called progressive sanctification. Ultimate
sanctification occurs at the Rapture of the Church when the believer receives a
resurrection body, minus the old sin nature and minus all human good.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The divine attitude of grace is expressed in Isaiah 30:18-19.
God is constantly waiting to pour out His grace on every believer. Every
believer has tasted the grace of God many times.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore the LORD longs to be gracious to you, And therefore
He waits on high to have compassion on you. For the LORD is a God of justice;
How blessed are all those who long for Him. O people in Zion, inhabitant in
Jerusalem, you will weep no longer. He will surely be gracious to you at the
sound of your cry; when He hears it, He will answer you.” (Isaiah 30:18-19,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><a name="_Grace_of_God"></a><b>Paul’s Grace Massage to
The Galatians</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God used a human author, a rascal, the Apostle Paul, to
write Galatians and that was pure grace. God gave Paul the spiritual gift of
Apostleship and that was grace. God provided salvation complete in Christ and
that was grace. The Galatians were still alive even after turning from grace
and that is pure grace. God initiated the plan of salvation for you in
evangelism and that was grace.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God didn’t require man to originate the content of His
message and that is grace. God provided man a system of perception for
receiving biblical content and that is grace. God used man in spite of his
background and that most definitely is grace. Production is a grace operation,
therefore, it doesn’t depend on reputation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God provides a framework of Christian liberty and
respects the volitional choice of man and that is grace. The enemy of grace is
legalism. Grace is not the monopoly of any certain group of people. It is for
Jew or Greek, bond or free, male or female.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Grace can only be received by a non-meritorious system called
faith. Grace includes all the provision of God's promises to Abraham and Isaac.
Grace is shown to be mutually exclusive from works. Grace has always been God’s
procedure in handling His plan. The Mosaic Law did not take its place. God
provided the indwelling Holy Spirit for the Church Age believer as a grace
enablement to accomplish what man could not accomplish in the flesh. This is a
grace provision for the Christian way of life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God provided a permanent, final, and fixed position for
all His children and that is grace. God has provided an inheritance for His
family and that is grace. The true grace expression in the spiritual life is
the filling of the Holy Spirit and the fruits thereof. The opposite of grace is
the human good production or sin when the soul is controlled by the old sin
nature. Grace in the Christian way of life is a necessity because of our many
relationships with people. We must be grace oriented and be able to relate also
to others.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A grace relationship and understanding does not absolve
us of personal responsibility. We have responsibilities to weaker believers who
have not yet grown to spiritual maturity. It is so easy to quote the phrase, “God’s
grace will sustain you” then go our merry way and forget them. If we really understand
grace, we know that all we are or have is due to God's grace, so we should
curtail efforts on our part to seek personal glory.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Grace and Salvation are Inseparable </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Grace and salvation are inseparably linked. The basis for
salvation is the grace of God. Titus 2:11; Acts 15:11. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all
men,” (Titus 2:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But we believe that we are saved through the grace of
the Lord Jesus, in the same way as they also are.&quot;” (Acts 15:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Without grace, there would be no cleansing of sin and
escape from the Lake of Fire. Psalms 103:8-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD is compassionate and gracious, Slow to anger and
abounding in lovingkindness. He will not always strive with us, Nor will He
keep His anger forever. He has not dealt with us according to our sins, Nor
rewarded us according to our iniquities. For as high as the heavens are above
the earth, So great is His lovingkindness toward those who fear Him. As far as
the east is from the west, So far has He removed our transgressions from us.”
(Psalms 103:8-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Without grace, we could not be justified freely. Salvation
is believing in Jesus Christ where God has already provided everything for
salvation. All man can do is respond in a non-meritorious way – faith alone in
Jesus Christ alone. Rom. 3:23-24.</p>

<p class=Verses>“for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, being
justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ
Jesus;” (Romans 3:23-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If we could be saved by good works, we would have to keep
doing good works to maintain that salvation. The moment our good works were
stopped, so would end our salvation. But salvation is based on the grace of God
and you cannot lose that salvation once faith has been expressed in Jesus
Christ. Without grace, victory over sin could not be maintained. Rom. 5:20-21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The Law came in so that the transgression would increase; but
where sin increased, grace abounded all the more, so that, as sin reigned in
death, even so grace would reign through righteousness to eternal life through
Jesus Christ our Lord.” (Romans 5:20-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Without grace, God’s salvation could not be a gift. Eph.
2:8-9. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not
of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one
may boast.” (Ephesians 2:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Without grace, God could have never become poor by paying
for our sins on the Cross and you could never have become rich in salvation. Grace
orientation is a bona fide motivation and the bona fide pattern of thought for
giving. 2 Cor. 8:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though
He was rich, yet for your sake He became poor, so that you through His poverty
might become rich.” (2 Corinthians 8:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Without grace, Jesus Christ could have never died
spiritually for us. His deity could not die. The humanity of the unique
God-man, Jesus Christ died spiritually on the Cross for all of the sins of
mankind, then He dismissed His human spirit and died physically. Heb. 2:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But we do see Him who was made for a little while lower than
the angels, namely, Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory
and honor, so that by the grace of God He might taste death for everyone.”
(Hebrews 2:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Without grace, we could never have become joint-heirs
with Jesus Christ. Titus 3:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“so that being justified by His grace we would be made heirs
according to the hope of eternal life.” (Titus 3:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Father used grace in redeeming the individual. We
are to use the grace of God at all times.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Futility of Salvation by Works</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Christ has set us free (spiritual freedom) to execute the
Christian way of life and He set us free from things which slow us down.
Believers are to keep on standing fast. Gal. 5:1. </p>

<p class=Verses>“It was for freedom that Christ set us free; therefore keep
standing firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery.” (Galatians
5:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Trying to keep the Mosaic Law can hinder us from
executing the Christian way of life. We are not under the Mosaic Law, but under
the higher law produced by the filling of the Holy Spirit. Gal. 5:22-23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience,
kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things
there is no law.” (Galatians 5:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We now have the power to honor Jesus Christ, the purpose
for which He has left us here on earth to represent Him to the world. Believers
have everything they have the grace apparatus for perception. See category of
the <a href="#_Grace_Apparatus_For">Grace Apparatus for Perception</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the early Church, circumcision was an indication that
a person would adhere to the Mosaic Law for the rest of his life. If a person
was going to be saved by a system of works and legalism, then seeking Christ
for salvation was deemed profitless. If the believer wants to return to the
Mosaic Law as a way life, they must accept the responsibility to adhere to the
entire Law. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Galatians 5:2-3 is concerned primarily with the Christian
way of life. Works are not to produce spirituality. Works cannot produce
salvation. Today, circumcision is not an issue in the Gentile world, but today
it is believe and join a church, believe and be baptized, or believe and
forsake your sins. Or in the Christian way of life it is confess and feel
sorry, confess and vow to never do it again. It can be any work added to
salvation or spirituality. Any work added to the spiritual life is an insult to
the blood of Christ.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Behold I, Paul, say to you that if you receive circumcision,
Christ will be of no benefit to you. And I testify again to every man who
receives circumcision, that he is under obligation to keep the whole Law.”
(Galatians 5:2-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Salvation is either by man alone (works), by God and man
(also works), or by God alone through faith alone in Jesus Christ. The Galatian
believers had been “taken in” by legalism and were trying to live under the
Mosaic Law as their Christian way of life. Spirituality by works only puts a
believer in a strait jacket and cancels any spiritual growth because it is not
done while filled with the Holy Spirit and it is therefore, not using God's
grace resources to accomplish it. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Grace and the Christian Walk</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God's grace is always to be the focus in our prayers. Heb.
4:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore let us draw near with confidence to the throne of
grace, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.”
(Hebrews 4:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Grace is involved in the believer’s undeserved suffering.
Through grace, God is able to bless the believer in the midst of suffering and
heartaches. 2 Corinthians 12:9-10 is God's answer to the Apostle Paul’s prayers
for God to remove the “thorn” in his side. The believer’s reliance on God's
grace resources in times of difficulty is the means by which we grow
spiritually. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And He has said to me, &quot;My grace is sufficient for you,
for power is perfected in weakness.&quot; Most gladly, therefore, I will rather
boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me.
Therefore I am well content with weaknesses, with insults, with distresses,
with persecutions, with difficulties, for Christ's sake; for when I am weak,
then I am strong.” (2 Corinthians 12:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Grace releases enabling power of the Holy Spirit to the
believer when in fellowship. 2 Tim. 2:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“You therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in
Christ Jesus.” (2 Timothy 2:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our dependence on God's grace as we learn and apply more
Bible doctrine produces stability in the spiritual life. 1 Peter 5:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Through Silvanus, our faithful brother (for so I regard him),
I have written to you briefly, exhorting and testifying that this is the true
grace of God. Stand firm in it!” (1 Peter 5:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Grace is involved in spiritual growth. That is why the
legalist, the believer negative to Bible doctrine never grows up and remains a
baby spiritually. 2 Peter 3:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory, both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.”
(2 Peter 3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believers entire manner of living should have a
complete focus on God's grace provision. 2 Cor. 1:2, Heb. 12:28.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus
Christ.” (2 Corinthians 1:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, since we receive a kingdom which cannot be shaken,
let us show gratitude, by which we may offer to God an acceptable service with
reverence and awe;” (Hebrews 12:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Grace is the basis for production of divine good. 1 Cor.
15:10, 2 Cor. 6:1, 2 Cor. 9:8, 2 Cor. 9:11, 1 Peter 2:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward
me did not prove vain; but I labored even more than all of them, yet not I, but
the grace of God with me.” (1 Corinthians 15:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And working together with Him, we also urge you not to receive
the grace of God in vain—” (2 Corinthians 6:1, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that
always having all sufficiency in everything, you may have an abundance for
every good deed;” (2 Corinthians 9:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“you will be enriched in everything for all liberality, which
through us is producing thanksgiving to God.” (2 Corinthians 9:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this finds favor, if for the sake of conscience toward God
a person bears up under sorrows when suffering unjustly.”  (1 Peter 2:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our “new freedom” in grace is not freedom to live it up,
but to serve the Lord apart from the bondage of the old sin nature. In
Galatians 5:5, “hope of righteousness” is an appositional genitive in the
Greek, which means it is a hope which is experiential righteousness. There is
an experiential righteousness in the Christian way of life that is produced by
the Holy Spirit in believers by faith, not by the Mosaic Law.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For we through the Spirit, by faith, are waiting for the hope
of righteousness.” (Galatians 5:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Multiplication of Grace </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Multiplication of grace is God’s extension to the
believer. Orientation to grace is man’s appropriation of what God has extended,
resulting in awareness and blessing. 1 Peter 1:2. </p>

<p class=Verses>“according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by the
sanctifying work of the Spirit, to obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with His
blood: May grace and peace be yours in the fullest measure.” (1 Peter 1:2,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Grace is multiplied to you from the day you are born
again and it will go on forever and ever. God’s grace is not like a cake that
has to be divided among all believers. Grace is never divided, but is always
multiplied. His grace resources are infinite so there is no necessity for
dividing grace. There is no limit to God's grace. God always has something for
you in His plan and His resources are infinite and therefore grace will be
multiplied to you throughout all eternity as well as in time. 2 Peter 1:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God
and of Jesus our Lord;” (2 Peter 1:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We can never remove ourselves from the sphere of God’s
grace, nor can anyone else. Eternal security is grace and you have it whether
or not you know it, or believe it. Rom. 8:38-39.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels,
nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor
height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us
from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Romans 8:38-39,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believer never escapes the multiplying grace of God even
though they don’t understand what grace is all about. God blesses in grace and
He disciplines in grace. God's grace is multiplied in election regeneration,
and resurrection. We enter election through grace. 1 Peter 1:2-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by the
sanctifying work of the Spirit, to obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with His
blood: May grace and peace be yours in the fullest measure. Blessed be the God
and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has
caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus
Christ from the dead,” (1 Peter 1:2-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God's grace is multiplied in inheritance and eternal
security. 1 Peter 1:4-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“to obtain an inheritance which is imperishable and undefiled
and will not fade away, reserved in heaven for you, who are protected by the
power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last
time.” (1 Peter 1:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God's grace is multiplied in undeserved suffering. 1
Peter 1:6-8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“In this you greatly rejoice, even though now for a little
while, if necessary, you have been distressed by various trials, so that the
proof of your faith, being more precious than gold which is perishable, even
though tested by fire, may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at
the revelation of Jesus Christ; and though you have not seen Him, you love Him,
and though you do not see Him now, but believe in Him, you greatly rejoice with
joy inexpressible and full of glory,” (1 Peter 1:6-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God's grace is multiplied in deliverance. 1 Peter 1:9-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“obtaining as the outcome of your faith the salvation of your
souls. As to this salvation, the prophets who prophesied of the grace that
would come to you made careful searches and inquiries,” (1 Peter 1:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God's grace is multiplied in our study of the Word of
God. 1 Peter 1:11-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“seeking to know what person or time the Spirit of Christ
within them was indicating as He predicted the sufferings of Christ and the
glories to follow. It was revealed to them that they were not serving
themselves, but you, in these things which now have been announced to you
through those who preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from
heaven—things into which angels long to look.” (1 Peter 1:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our peace of soul is multiplied in our mental attitude
and in our hope or confidence in God's grace provision and protection. 1 Peter
1:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, prepare your minds for action, keep sober in
spirit, fix your hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the
revelation of Jesus Christ.” (1 Peter 1:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our peace of soul is multiplied in our understanding of
God's righteousness and justice. 1 Peter 1:14-16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“As obedient children, do not be conformed to the former lusts
which were yours in your ignorance, but like the Holy One who called you, be
holy yourselves also in all your behavior; because it is written, &quot;YOU
SHALL BE HOLY, FOR I AM HOLY.&quot;” (1 Peter 1:14-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our peace of soul is multiplied in prayer to God the
Father. 1 Peter 1:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If you address as Father the One who impartially judges
according to each one's work, conduct yourselves in fear during the time of
your stay on earth;” (1 Peter 1:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our peace of soul is multiplied in redemption and
predestination. 1 Peter 1:18-20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable things like
silver or gold from your futile way of life inherited from your forefathers,
but with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and spotless, the blood of
Christ. For He was foreknown before the foundation of the world, but has
appeared in these last times for the sake of you” (1 Peter 1:18-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our peace of soul is multiplied in our dependence on the
Father’s plan for our lives. Our peace of soul is multiplied in our divine good
production through the enabling power of the Holy Spirit 1 Peter 1:21-22. </p>

<p class=Verses>“who through Him are believers in God, who raised Him from the
dead and gave Him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God. Since you have
in obedience to the truth purified your souls for a sincere love of the
brethren, fervently love one another from the heart,” (1 Peter 1:21-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our peace of soul is multiplied in our spiritual growth
and our gained understanding of the Word of God. 1 Peter 1:23-25.</p>

<p class=Verses>“for you have been born again not of seed which is perishable
but imperishable, that is, through the living and enduring word of God. For,
&quot;ALL FLESH IS LIKE GRASS, AND ALL ITS GLORY LIKE THE FLOWER OF GRASS. THE
GRASS WITHERS, AND THE FLOWER FALLS OFF, BUT THE WORD OF THE LORD ENDURES
FOREVER.&quot; And this is the word which was preached to you.” (1 Peter
1:23-25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Both multiplications end the same way with an emphasis on
Bible doctrine. God is “tapping His foot” waiting to bless us. Isa. 30:18-19.
God's grace blessings glorify God.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore the LORD longs to be gracious to you, And therefore
He waits on high to have compassion on you. For the LORD is a God of justice;
How blessed are all those who long for Him. O people in Zion, inhabitant in
Jerusalem, you will weep no longer. He will surely be gracious to you at the
sound of your cry; when He hears it, He will answer you.” (Isaiah 30:18-19,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Two-fold Danger in the Christian Life</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is a two-fold danger in the Christian life - the
careless irresponsible sins of the Gentile and the cold legalistic thinking of
the Jews. The doctrine of grace gives the proper perspective to the Christian
life as well as the correct balance. The term grace or its corrected terms is
used some 200 times in the Scripture. Grace is the work of God on behalf of man
apart from man’s ability or merit. However, non-merited favor just doesn’t
click with some. Now we go from a working definition to a concept of grace.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The concept of grace depends completely upon the
character of God. Grace depends upon who and what God is and never who and what
man is. Therefore, grace excludes human good and human merit. Grace is God
doing the work (divine good) and man receiving what God has provided in a
non-meritorious way. God gets all of the credit. Legalism or religion equals
man doing the work and human good. God is supposed to bless man on the basis of
what man can make of himself. Man gets the credit.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The best thing God can do for you is to make you like His
Son. God in His plan of grace in eternity past decided to do this before man
existed. Rom. 8:28-29, Gal. 4:19, Gal. 5:22-23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And we know that God causes all things to work together for
good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.
For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the
image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many brethren;”
(Romans 8:28-29, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“My children, with whom I am again in labor until Christ is
formed in you—” (Galatians 4:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience,
kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things
there is no law.” (Galatians 5:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At salvation, positionally you are like His Son. In the
spiritual life, you are experientially you are like His Son. In eternity, you
will be physically like His Son and with His Son in a resurrection body.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every believer has tasted the grace of God without
exception. At least once in your life, you came into contact with grace and you
responded. In 1 Peter 2:3, “if” is a first class condition which means you have
indeed tasted of the grace God. Tasting of the grace of God involves two
concepts in salvation – reconciliation and propitiation. 1 Peter 2:2-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“like newborn babies, long for the pure milk of the word, so
that by it you may grow in respect to salvation, if you have tasted the
kindness of the Lord. And coming to Him as to a living stone which has been
rejected by men, but is choice and precious in the sight of God,” (1 Peter
2:2-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Reconciliation is from man’s standpoint. When Jesus
Christ was on the cross, He did the most for us by obtaining our peace through
purchase. Now He does much more. Rom. 5:1-2, Rom. 8:32.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with
God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom also we have obtained our
introduction by faith into this grace in which we stand; and we exult in hope
of the glory of God.” (Romans 5:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him over for
us all, how will He not also with Him freely give us all things?” (Romans 8:32,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Propitiation is from God’s viewpoint. God is sovereignty,
absolute righteousness (+R) , and justice. God’s absolute righteousness (+R)
and justice make up His holiness which was satisfied by the work of the Son.
Therefore, God is free to love without violating any aspect of His other
perfect attributes. 1 John 2:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“My little children, I am writing these things to you so that
you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus
Christ the righteous; and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins; and not
for ours only, but also for those of the whole world.” (1 John 2:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Father can love you and still be consistent with
His own holiness because of propitiation. This is most important because it
shows God’s attitude toward you right now. God is constantly waiting to pour
out His grace on every believer. Isaiah 30:18-19. He is tapping His foot
waiting to pour out blessing on you. What’s holding it up? You are! When you
are out of fellowship and in resultant carnality, He has to spend so much time
disciplining you that He can’t pour out His grace on you as He would like.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore the LORD longs to be gracious to you, And therefore
He waits on high to have compassion on you. For the LORD is a God of justice;
How blessed are all those who long for Him. O people in Zion, inhabitant in
Jerusalem, you will weep no longer. He will surely be gracious to you at the
sound of your cry; when He hears it, He will answer you.” (Isaiah 30:18-19,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Falling from Grace</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer’s greatest occupational hazard is
disorientation to the grace of God. Disorientation to grace includes being out
of fellowship, having negative signals toward Bible doctrine, creation of a
vacuum in your soul that sucks in legalism, religion, false doctrine, human
viewpoint, etc. This is occupation with the details of life instead of
occupation with Jesus Christ. Gal. 5:4, Heb. 12:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“You have been severed from Christ, you who are seeking to be
justified by law; you have fallen from grace.” (Galatians 5:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“See to it that no one comes short of the grace of God; that no
root of bitterness springing up causes trouble, and by it many be defiled;”
(Hebrews 12:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Salvation is by grace. God provides for all our needs.
Spirituality is also by grace. Falling from grace refers to not using grace.
For the unbeliever, it would keep them in unbelief because they have not
expressed faith alone in the work of Jesus Christ alone for salvation. For the
believer to not use grace, would be to get out of fellowship. Remember, when in
doubt, think grace!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Galatians 5:4, “have fallen from grace” is <span
lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>κπι</span>́<span lang=EL>πτω</span> (ekpiptō)
and means you are no longer controlled by the principle of grace. You are not
using God’s grace. You are out of fellowship with God and your soul is
controlled by your sin nature. You are in carnality. This verse does not refer
to loss of salvation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Peter 3:17, “fall from your own steadfastness”
refers to an unsteady believer not using God's grace resources in the spiritual
life because they are trying to use their own human abilities in carnality.
They are trying to please God by producing human good.</p>

<p class=Verses>“You therefore, beloved, knowing this beforehand, be on your
guard so that you are not carried away by the error of unprincipled men and
fall from your own steadfastness,” (2 Peter 3:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The remedy to carnality is confession of sin and learning
and applying Bible doctrine using God's grace and thereby growing spiritually.
2 Peter 3:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory, both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.”
(2 Peter 3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 12:15, “comes short” is <span lang=EL>υ</span>̔<span
lang=EL>στερε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (hustereō) and means to be left
behind in the race and so fail to reach the goal, to fall short of the end. It
is an idiom for not using the grace of God. To regain God's grace involves
confession or citing your known sins to God the Father and He is grace removes
all unrighteousness – the sins you forgot or were ignorant of. You are then
filled with the Holy Spirit and empowered to live the spiritual life and
fulfill God's grace plan for your life. </p>

<p class=Verses>“See to it that no one comes short of the grace of God; that no
root of bitterness springing up causes trouble, and by it many be defiled;”
(Hebrews 12:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Turning from grace produces adverse effects in the life
of a believer. Departure from the grace principle in the Christian way of life
living causes communicators anxiety for their sheep. A communicator who is
grace oriented does not take a doctrinal problem as an attack on him
personally.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A person is fallen from grace when he has replaced the
grace system with some other system for salvation, spirituality, maturity, or
production. Grace and faith are set in analogy as warring against legalism, and
vice versa. Grace is never to be distorted as a license to sin. True liberty
should not be used as a base of operations for the old sin nature.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Pride Rejects Grace</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Pride in the carnal believer results in the rejection of
eternal security. They think their sins are greater than what the plan of God
can handle. Pride causes the believer to succumb or knuckle under to pressures
and adversity in life. The proud believer thinks their sufferings are greater
than God's grace provision can cover.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is the pride of the pseudo-spiritual believer. The
negative proud believer thinks their human system is greater than the power of
the Holy Spirit in them. The pride of the believer results when under emotional
revolt of the soul. The negative proud believer thinks their emotions, their
feelings, and their experiences are more important than Bible doctrine.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 8:9, “that though He was rich” is <span
lang=EL>πλου</span>́<span lang=EL>σιος</span><span lang=EL> </span><span
lang=EL>ω</span>̓́<span lang=EL>ν</span> (plousios ōn), the present active
participle of <i>eimi</i>, an absolute status quo verb. This was the status quo
of God in eternity past. This is the maximum concept of wealth. The phrase means
abounding in riches. “Yet for your sake” is <span lang=EL>διά</span> plus
accusative plural of <span lang=EL>συ</span> and means “because of you all” and
refers to the substitutionary plan of salvation on the Cross.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though
He was rich, yet for your sake He became poor, so that you through His poverty
might become rich.” (2 Corinthians 8:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“He became poor” is the aorist active indicative of <span
lang=EL>πτωχευ</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (ptōcheuō) and means abject
poverty. He had something to give, His humanity in innocence. This refers to
the three hours on the Cross when He bore our sins. He did this voluntarily
resulting in the reality of Christ Himself being judged for our sins.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God’s Grace Toward Israel</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Isaiah 54:6, Israel is compared to a jealous,
maligning, and nagging wife.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For the LORD has called you, Like a wife forsaken and
grieved in spirit, Even like a wife of one's youth when she is rejected,&quot;
Says your God.” (Isaiah 54:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ezekiel 16 provides graphic imagery to portray God's
grace to Israel when the nation was abandoned and unacceptable to anyone else. The
imagery is a faithless bride from her birth to her harlotry and evil practices.
Ezek. 16:5, Ezek. 16:9-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;No eye looked with pity on you to do any of these things
for you, to have compassion on you. Rather you were thrown out into the open
field, for you were abhorred on the day you were born.” (Ezekiel 16:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Then I bathed you with water, washed off your blood from
you and anointed you with oil. &quot;I also clothed you with embroidered cloth
and put sandals of porpoise skin on your feet; and I wrapped you with fine
linen and covered you with silk. &quot;I adorned you with ornaments, put
bracelets on your hands and a necklace around your neck. &quot;I also put a
ring in your nostril, earrings in your ears and a beautiful crown on your
head.” (Ezekiel 16:9-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But you trusted in your beauty and played the harlot
because of your fame, and you poured out your harlotries on every passer-by who
might be willing.” (Ezekiel 16:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Israel went from harlotry to sacrificing their children
to idols. Ezek. 16:20, Ezek. 16:28-29. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Moreover, you took your sons and daughters whom you had
borne to Me and sacrificed them to idols to be devoured. Were your harlotries
so small a matter?” (Ezekiel 16:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Moreover, you played the harlot with the Assyrians
because you were not satisfied; you played the harlot with them and still were
not satisfied. &quot;You also multiplied your harlotry with the land of
merchants, Chaldea, yet even with this you were not satisfied.&quot;'&quot;”
(Ezekiel 16:28-29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Through all of Israel’s evil practices and their
continued rejection of God's grace and commandments, God's grace continued
because of His unfailing unconditional love for them. God in grace established
His unconditional covenant with Israel. Ezek. 16:62-63. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Thus I will establish My covenant with you, and you
shall know that I am the LORD, so that you may remember and be ashamed and
never open your mouth anymore because of your humiliation, when I have forgiven
you for all that you have done,&quot; the Lord GOD declares.” (Ezekiel
16:62-63, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has accepted what the world has refused. God accepted
all in Israel who believed that the Messiah would come and be judged for their
sins. God accepted all in Israel who believed on the basis of the work of Jesus
Christ. Rom. 9:6, Rom. 9:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But it is not as though the word of God has failed. For they
are not all Israel who are descended from Israel;” (Romans 9:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children
of God, but the children of the promise are regarded as descendants.” (Romans
9:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every Jew who believed in Christ was saved. We as the
human race are like the nagging, evil woman. The only basis of our acceptance
to God is who and what Jesus Christ is. Therefore, Israel’s regathering in the
Land at the Second Advent is based entirely upon the principle of grace. Israel
was strong in legalism, but this never pleased God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Religion or human good won’t get you anywhere. In grace,
God called us at our worst because He approved of Jesus Christ at His best who
always was and is perfect.</p>
