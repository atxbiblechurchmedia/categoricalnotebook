<h2>Guilt</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Guilt is a feeling of worry or unhappiness that you have
because you have done something wrong, such as causing harm to another person.
Guilt is the state of one who has committed an offense especially consciously.
Guilt is also culpability that brings feelings of deserving censure or blame
especially for imagined offenses or from a sense of inadequacy. Legally, guilt
is having committed a breach of conduct such that it violates the law and
involves a penalty. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Biblically, guilt is a major mental attitude sin followed
often by guilty conduct. Guilt is also an emotional sin. Guilt is a motivator
and as a motivator it leads to no fulfillment. Guilt eliminates grace
orientation and causes emphasis on people over emphasis on God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Perpetuated guilt destroys the benefit of divine
discipline. Guilt is preoccupation with self and in the belief of the
correctness of one’s behavior. Guilt is self-righteous arrogance and denial.
Failure to use God's grace resources and <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the
right lobe of the soul to deal with life’s problems leads to carnality where
the sin nature controls the soul. Extended carnality means you are in denial
and are building garbage in the soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>From guilt comes restitution and it can become a way of
life. You blame others and deny any wrong doing because take no responsibility
for your decisions and their consequences. There is no gratitude and there is a
frantic search for happiness in denial, repression and projection. Hosea 8:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For they sow the wind And they reap the whirlwind. The
standing grain has no heads; It yields no grain. Should it yield, strangers
would swallow it up.” (Hosea 8:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God administers discipline to us to bring us around and
to take care of guilt. Prov. 6:16-19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“There are six things which the LORD hates, Yes, seven which
are an abomination to Him: Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, And hands that shed
innocent blood, A heart that devises wicked plans, Feet that run rapidly to
evil, A false witness who utters lies, And one who spreads strife among
brothers.” (Proverbs 6:16-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God administers discipline to us to make us think about
why we are being punished and to acknowledge or name our knows sins to God the
Father using 1 John 1:9. Divine discipline is always intended to get the
believer back into fellowship with God. Prov. 22:8; Col. 3:25; Gal. 6:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“He who sows iniquity will reap vanity, And the rod of his fury
will perish.” (Proverbs 22:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For he who does wrong will receive the consequences of the
wrong which he has done, and that without partiality.” (Colossians 3:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man
sows, this he will also reap.” (Galatians 6:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Guilt is the designation for the violation of a doctrine.
It is the fact of being a violator. Guilt feelings are just that, feelings
resulting from the old sin nature response to your guilt. The feelings
accompanied with conviction are bona fide. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Conviction is the bona fide soul response to a violation.
Guilt is the fact of the violation. Pain is the feeling often accompanying
conviction. Feeling guilty, sorry, sad, may be the feelings accompanying guilt
reaction.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Greek Terms for Guilt</b></p>

you?&quot; And they all condemned Him to be deserving of death.&quot;  (Mark
14:64, NASB)</p>

point, he has become guilty of all.&quot;  (James 2:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 23:18, “obligated” is <span lang=EL>ο</span>̓<span
lang=EL>φει</span>́<span lang=EL>λω</span> (opheilō) and means to be a debtor,
in violation to that which you by necessity must pay.</p>

nothing, but whoever swears by the offering on it, he is obligated.' &quot; 
(Matthew 23:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Hebrew terms for guilt</b></p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Abimelech said, &quot;What is this you have done to us?

us.&quot;&quot;  (Genesis 42:21, NASB)</p>

day near and have come to your years; therefore I have made you a reproach to
the nations and a mocking to all the lands.&quot;  (Ezekiel 22:4, NASB)</p>
