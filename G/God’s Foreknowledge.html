<h2>God’s Foreknowledge</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s foreknowledge is a subset of His omniscience and is
regarding believers only. God’s omniscience knew in eternity past all the
knowable. This included all actions, decisions, motivations, and thoughts of
all creatures. His foreknowledge includes only the reality (what has or will
happen) of believers’ actions, decisions, motivations, and thoughts. All of
God’s foreknowledge is in God’s Divine Decrees. God’s foreknowledge does not
produce or cause events, but recognizes events which will occur. All that we
have done or will do in our lives was known by God in eternity past as reality
before anything was created by Him. Acts 2:23.</p>

<p class=Verses> “this Man, delivered over by the predetermined plan and
foreknowledge of God, you nailed to a cross by the hands of godless men and put
Him to death.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 2:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has always known from eternity past every believer’s
thoughts, motives, decisions, and actions. There never was a time in all of
eternity past when God did not know everything about you. He always knew every
thought you would ever have, every motive that would be formed from those
thoughts, every decision you would make from your thoughts or lack of
thoughtfulness, and every action you will ever complete.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The foreknowledge of God makes nothing certain, but
merely acknowledges what is certain - the content of the Divine Decrees. 
Foreknowledge is a means of relating us to the plan of God as an individual
since eternity past. This gives us a sense of security. You are never lost or
forgotten by God. You are always in God's mind. This application keeps you from
self-pity. God foreknew all things about us and decreed them from His
omniscience. Isaiah 41:26; Isaiah 42:9; Isaiah 43:9; Isaiah 46:10; Acts 2:23; 1
Peter 1:2.   See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/D/Divine%20Decrees.html">Divine Decrees</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Who has declared this from the beginning, that we might
know? Or from former times, that we may say, &quot; He is right!&quot;? Surely
there was no one who declared, Surely there was no one who proclaimed, Surely
there was no one who heard your words.&quot;  (Isaiah 41:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Behold, the former things have come to pass, Now I
declare new things; Before they spring forth I proclaim them to
you.&quot;&quot;  (Isaiah 42:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;All the nations have gathered together So that the
peoples may be assembled. Who among them can declare this And proclaim to us
the former things? Let them present their witnesses that they may be justified,
Or let them hear and say, &quot;It is true.&quot;&quot;  (Isaiah 43:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Declaring the end from the beginning, And from ancient
times things which have not been done, Saying, 'My purpose will be established,
And I will accomplish all My good pleasure';&quot;  (Isaiah 46:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;this Man, delivered over by the predetermined plan and
foreknowledge of God, you nailed to a cross by the hands of godless men and put
Him to death.&quot;  (Acts 2:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by the
sanctifying work of the Spirit, to obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with His
blood: May grace and peace be yours in the fullest measure.&quot;  (1 Peter
1:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As God, the Lord Jesus Christ knew all things and all men.
Matt. 9:4; John 2:24-25; John 19:28; John 21:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, &quot;Why are you
thinking evil in your hearts? &quot;  (Matthew 9:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But Jesus, on His part, was not entrusting Himself to
them, for He knew all men, and because He did not need anyone to testify
concerning man, for He Himself knew what was in man.&quot;  (John 2:24-25,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;After this, Jesus, knowing that all things had already
been accomplished, to fulfill the Scripture, said, &quot;I am thirsty.&quot;
&quot;  (John 19:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He said to him the third time, &quot;Simon, son of John,
do you love Me?&quot; Peter was grieved because He said to him the third time,
&quot;Do you love Me?&quot; And he said to Him, &quot;Lord, You know all
things; You know that I love You.&quot; Jesus said to him, &quot;Tend My sheep.
&quot;  (John 21:17, NASB)</p>
