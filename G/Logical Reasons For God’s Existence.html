<h2>Logical Reasons For God’s Existence</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Ontological Reason</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The human mind has the concept of an absolute being and
therefore, such an absolute being must exist. The human mind is relative.
Therefore, if a relative factor can find an absolute factor and believe in its
existence and find reality in it, then such an absolute factor must exist.
Therefore, God must exist.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Religious Reason</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God exists because men universally believe in His
existence, the religious instinct. By hearing other people speak of God, you
become aware of His existence. Therefore it is worth investigating. This does
not often occur, but it does happen. Psalms 42:1-2; Acts 17:27.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; For the choir director. A Maskil of the sons of Korah.
As the deer pants for the water brooks, So my soul pants for You, O God. My
soul thirsts for God, for the living God; When shall I come and appear before
God?&quot;  (Psalms 42:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;that they would seek God, if perhaps they might grope for
Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us;&quot;  (Acts 17:27,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Moral or Anthropological Reason</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Man possesses a conscience with the urge to choose
between right and wrong, preferring right, indicating that behind it is an
absolute norm and standard of what is right and wrong. A material ungoverned
universe would know nothing of moral values and distinctions, therefore since
moral values and distinctions exist in government, in individuals with a
conscience, obviously there must be some supreme being as an instigator behind
these concepts. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Philosophical Reason </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The mind possesses a concept of something perfect and
absolute - something beyond the relative pattern. Therefore, there must be a
pre-existent, infinitely existent. Descartes used this philosophy through
rationalism.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Teleological Reason</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The structure of the universe from atoms to galaxies
demands an absolute being as master designer. Who is the designer? Jesus
Christ. Rom. 1:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For since the creation of the world His invisible
attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being
understood through what has been made, so that they are without excuse.&quot; 
(Romans 1:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Cosmological Reason </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The intuitive (perceived by the mind immediately) law of
cause and effect demands the existence of God. The universe is not its own
cause. Here is an effect, what caused it? </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All of these reasons have thinking in common. As you
think, you become aware of the existence of God. At that point, your volition
goes into operation. After an elapse of time, information will be provided by
God the Holy Spirit whereby you can make a decision. John 7:17. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;If anyone is willing to do His will, he will know
of the teaching, whether it is of God or whether I speak from Myself. &quot; 
(John 7:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The best you can do with the systems of rationalism and
empiricism is to say that someone exists, but I don’t understand them. Faith is
the only bona fide system of perception for understanding spiritual phenomena.</p>
