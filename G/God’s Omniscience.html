<h2><a name="_D-God’s_Omniscience"></a>God’s Omniscience</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Omniscience is defined as perfect, eternal, and
simultaneous knowledge of all that is knowable about all creatures and the
universe including both the actual and the possible. In eternity past, God knew
every thought, motivation, decision, and action of every creature. God’s
omniscience also includes all that could have been involved in every possible
situation where the individual action, decision or thought could have been
different.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s omniscience does not affect free will in any way.
God is merely aware of what all creatures will think and do before they do it.
Every minute detail of both angelic and human history was completely,
perfectly, and simultaneously known by God in eternity past.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is all knowledge. So many passages about the
omniscience of God are in Job, because while Job was griping and complaining,
it was brought to his attention that God knew his problems. God was aware of
Job's situation and God was not indifferent to him. Job 31:4; Job 34:21; Job
37:16; Job 42:2.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Does He not see my ways And number all my
steps?&quot;  (Job 31:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;For His eyes are upon the ways of a man, And He
sees all his steps. &quot;There is no darkness or deep shadow Where the workers
of iniquity may hide themselves.&quot;  (Job 34:21-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Do you know about the layers of the thick clouds,
The wonders of one perfect in knowledge,&quot;  (Job 37:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;I know that You can do all things, And that no
purpose of Yours can be thwarted.&quot;  (Job 42:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s omniscience is unlimited. Jer. 16:17; Ezek. 11:5;
Matt. 10:29-31; 1 Sam. 2:3; Psalms 139:1-6; Psalms 147:4-5; Col. 2:2-3. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;For My eyes are on all their ways; they are not
hidden from My face, nor is their iniquity concealed from My eyes.&quot; 
(Jeremiah 16:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and He said to
me, &quot;Say, 'Thus says the LORD, &quot;So you think, house of Israel, for I
know your thoughts.&quot;  (Ezekiel 11:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He counts the number of the stars; He gives names to all
of them. Great is our Lord and abundant in strength; His understanding is
infinite.&quot;  (Psalms 147:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“that their hearts may be encouraged, having been knit together
in love, and attaining to all the wealth that comes from the full assurance of
understanding, resulting in a true knowledge of God's mystery, that is, Christ
Himself, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.”
(Colossians 2:2-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is infinite wisdom and understanding. Prov. 3:19-20; Jer.
17:10; Jer. 51:15; Matt. 6:8; Rom. 8:27; Isaiah 40:13-14; Nahum 1:7; Rom. 11:33;
1 John 3:19-20.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;I, the LORD, search the heart, I test the mind,
Even to give to each man according to his ways, According to the results of his
deeds.&quot;  (Jeremiah 17:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;So do not be like them; for your Father knows what
you need before you ask Him. &quot;  (Matthew 6:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the
Spirit is, because He intercedes for the saints according to the will of
God.&quot;  (Romans 8:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and
knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and unfathomable His
ways!&quot;  (Romans 11:33, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God's Self-Knowledge</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God's self-knowledge relates to the other members of the
Trinity. Each member of the Trinity has perfect knowledge of Himself and all
His attributes of deity and how they function in relation to Himself and the
other members of the Trinity. Each member of the Trinity knew simultaneously in
eternity past all that is knowable about the other two members of the Trinity.
This infinite knowledge is because each has identical absolute and perfect
attributes. For example, God the Father knows everything about Himself as well
as God the Son (Jesus Christ in Hypostatic Union) and God the Holy Spirit. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Since God is a person, He possesses both
self-consciousness and self-determination in relation to His self-knowledge.
Therefore, God acts in compatibility with His absolute will, knowledge, and
perfection. God knows Himself to be beyond comparison with any created being.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God's Omniscience Related To Time</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s omniscience is independent of the passing of time.
God invented time for His created beings. Time has nothing to do with God's
knowledge. Because God knew all the knowable in eternity past, the future is as
clear to Him as is the past.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has always known everything. To Him, what we perceive
as the unknown future is just as well known to God as is the past. We as
created beings have to learn things as we live our lives. God does not. God has
never had to learn anything. He has always known everything. God's omniscience
always existed in eternity past. There never was a time when He didn't know all
that could be known. Therefore, there is no limitation to the knowledge of
infinite and eternal God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Since God possesses self-consciousness,
self-determination, and absolute and simultaneous knowledge of all things, He
is absolutely perfect in His knowledge.  God's knowledge is never irrational.
This is in contrast to many people who have knowledge about a lot of things,
but are irrational, theoretical, and speculative. God's knowledge was absolute,
objective, and simultaneous in eternity past and will remain so throughout the
eternal future.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every minute detail of both angelic and human history is
completely, perfectly, and simultaneously known. He also understood how every
detail would relate and interact with other creatures. Therefore, it is in
God's mind at all times. He doesn't have to remember anything or learn
anything.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God knew everything about you that is knowable, every
thought you've ever had, your every decision, motive, and action from eternity
past. This is also true for the billions of His created angels and human
beings. Both cause and effect, actual and possible, reality and potential have
always been known by Him. Such a knowledge transcends human comprehension. To
know it all simultaneously before time began, in eternity past actually is
beyond our comprehension. We must accept this by faith. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God's Omniscience Related To His Other Attributes</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God's omniscience is totally compatible with all of His
perfect and absolute attributes. God's knowledge cannot be more or less than it
is. Being absolute, God can never have greater knowledge. God’s knowledge is an
absolute pinnacle of all that can be known. His knowledge of Himself cannot be
more or less than it is today, in eternity past, or in eternity future.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is immutable. He cannot ever change because He is
perfect and absolute. Therefore, His knowledge of Himself and of His creation
cannot change. Therefore, His knowledge is as unalterable as He is. This means
that God cannot change or be inaccurate in His knowledge. 1 Cor. 2:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL
INSTRUCT HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Because God is immutable. He has never changed and His
knowledge has never changed.  His attributes have never changed. God is aware
of all the changes in creatures. God's knowledge is never complicated by
ignorance, absurdities, or emotional reaction.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is eternal. God has always existed. This means that
His knowledge is also eternal and thus not related to the passing of time.
God’s word endures for eternity. God's knowledge of Himself precedes both time
and is not limited to space. Therefore, His knowledge of Himself is not subject
to time and space. God will not know more about Himself as time passes. 1 Peter
1: 23-25.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;for you have been born again not of seed which is
perishable but imperishable, that is, through the living and enduring word of
God. For, &quot;ALL FLESH IS LIKE GRASS, AND ALL ITS GLORY LIKE THE FLOWER OF
GRASS. THE GRASS WITHERS, AND THE FLOWER FALLS OFF, BUT THE WORD OF THE LORD
ENDURES FOREVER.&quot; And this is the word which was preached to you.&quot; 
(1 Peter 1:23-25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is infinite. Therefore, God's knowledge is without
boundary or limitation in the universe. God exists beyond the created universe
as well everywhere simultaneously within the universe. Therefore, God's
knowledge is infinite and perfect and not limited to the universe which He
created.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is sovereign. Therefore, His knowledge is superior to
all other knowledge of created beings. God is in absolute control of everything
at all times – except for the free will of mankind. God never had to learn
anything. There never was a time when He did not know all that can be known.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is absolute truth. He cannot lie or deceive about
what He knows. If He deceived anyone about anything, He would cease to be
perfect and absolute truth.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God's knowledge precedes both time and His creation of
the universe. In the eternal and immeasurable past, God had total, absolute,
and complete knowledge about everything that would ever be.   </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The omniscience of God knows all that would have been
involved in every situation where a person's decisions and actions might have
been different from what they actually were. This means that God’s omniscience
and foreknowledge are related to the His divine decrees.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God's Foreknowledge</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s foreknowledge is a subset of His omniscience and is
regarding believers only. God’s omniscience knew in eternity past all the
knowable. This included all actions, decisions, motivations, and thoughts of
all creatures. His foreknowledge includes only the reality (what has or will
happen) of believers’ actions, decisions, motivations, and thoughts.  All of
God’s foreknowledge is in God’s Divine Decrees. All that we have done or will
do in our lives was known by God as reality before anything existed in eternity
past.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has always known from eternity past every believer’s
thoughts, motives, decisions, and actions. There never was a time in all of
eternity past when God did not know everything about you. He always knew every
thought you would ever have, every motive that would be formed from those
thoughts, every decision you would make from your thoughts or lack of
thoughtfulness, and every action you will ever complete.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The foreknowledge of God makes nothing certain, but
merely acknowledges what is certain. This is the content of the Decrees.
Foreknowledge is a means of relating us to the plan of God as an individual
since eternity past. Isaiah 41:26; Isaiah 42:9; Isaiah 43:9; Isaiah 46:10; Acts
2:23; 1 Peter 1:2.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Who has declared this from the beginning, that we might
know? Or from former times, that we may say, &quot; He is right!&quot;? Surely
there was no one who declared, Surely there was no one who proclaimed, Surely
there was no one who heard your words.&quot;  (Isaiah 41:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Behold, the former things have come to pass, Now I
declare new things; Before they spring forth I proclaim them to
you.&quot;&quot;  (Isaiah 42:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;All the nations have gathered together So that the
peoples may be assembled. Who among them can declare this And proclaim to us
the former things? Let them present their witnesses that they may be justified,
Or let them hear and say, &quot;It is true.&quot;&quot;  (Isaiah 43:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Declaring the end from the beginning, And from ancient
times things which have not been done, Saying, 'My purpose will be established,
And I will accomplish all My good pleasure';&quot;  (Isaiah 46:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;this Man, delivered over by the predetermined plan and
foreknowledge of God, you nailed to a cross by the hands of godless men and put
Him to death.&quot;  (Acts 2:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by the
sanctifying work of the Spirit, to obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with His
blood: May grace and peace be yours in the fullest measure.&quot;  (1 Peter
1:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This gives us a sense of security. You are never lost or
forgotten by God. You are always in God's mind. This application keeps you from
self-pity. God foreknows all things about us as certainly future because He has
decreed them from His omniscience. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As God, the Lord Jesus Christ knew all things and all men.
Matt. 9:4; John 2:24-25; John 19:28; John 21:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, &quot;Why are you
thinking evil in your hearts? &quot;  (Matthew 9:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But Jesus, on His part, was not entrusting Himself to
them, for He knew all men, and because He did not need anyone to testify
concerning man, for He Himself knew what was in man.&quot;  (John 2:24-25,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;After this, Jesus, knowing that all things had already
been accomplished, to fulfill the Scripture, said, &quot;I am thirsty.&quot;
&quot;  (John 19:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He said to him the third time, &quot;Simon, son of John,
do you love Me?&quot; Peter was grieved because He said to him the third time,
&quot;Do you love Me?&quot; And he said to Him, &quot;Lord, You know all
things; You know that I love You.&quot; Jesus said to him, &quot;Tend My sheep.
&quot;  (John 21:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God’s Omniscience and The Free Will of Man</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God invented the free will of man. Through His
omniscience, He knew eternally and simultaneously how it would function in
human history. The major principle here is that in human history, the
sovereignty of God and the free will of man coexist by divine decree.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You must understand that God's perfect knowledge of all
of mankind’s decisions has nothing to do with the actual function of mankind’s
free will. God knew in eternity past what we would think, say and do and what
our motives would be in every possible situation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In eternity past, the sovereignty of God the Father gave
every Church Age believer election and predestination. God the Father also knew
what your every thought, motive, decision, and action would be. God does not
and never will coerce any actions of the human race. We are guaranteed our free
will from God Himself.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If you are believer in Jesus Christ, you have a destiny.
Predestination is a part of that destiny.  Only God knows what you will think,
say, or do. He didn’t tell anyone. Not even you.  Therefore, your decisions
determine your life’s outcome. God isn’t going to perform miracles to keep you
on track or in line. He will allow you to live your life as you wish, even
though He may not approve of what you do. Predestination is what God provides
so that you can fulfill His plan for your life and be given the blessings He
has promised. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Remember that it is God's will that every member of the
human race come to know Jesus Christ as their Savior. The fact that millions of
people do not believe in Jesus Christ indicates that the sovereignty of God and
the free will of man coexist by divine decree. This indicates that God does not
in any way coerce human volition.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God manufactured free will for both angelic and human
creatures. God knew simultaneously and eternally how every human being would
function in history, just as He knew how every angelic creature would function
in prehistoric times. God knows whether you will take advantage of all that He
has provided. He has left it up to you. You can decide freely to learn Bible
doctrine on a daily basis and advance to spiritual maturity in your life.
Conversely, you can freely decide to reject Bible doctrine and all that God has
planned for you. Either way, you will spend eternity with God. The difference
will be the blessings you gained in life and for eternity. The more blessings
that God can convey, the more He is glorified because it is all provided by
God’s grace. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Five Elective Decrees</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The five elective decrees from the Divine Decrees are
known theologically as Modified Infralapsarianism. The first elective decree
was the decree of God to create mankind. God’s purpose for this was to resolve
the prehistoric Angelic Conflict. When members of the human race accepted Jesus
Christ as their personal Savior by faith alone in Christ alone, the angelic
conflict was resolved. Heb. 2:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things, and
through whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to perfect the
author of their salvation through sufferings.&quot;  (Hebrews 2:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The second elective decree was the decree of God to
permit the fall of mankind as an extension of the Angelic Conflict. The third
elective decree was the decree of God to provide eternal salvation for all
mankind under unlimited atonement. This occurred when all personal sins from
the human race (past, present, and future) were imputed to the humanity of our
Lord Jesus Christ as our substitute and were judged by God the Father while He
was still alive on the Cross. 2 Cor. 5:14-15; 2 Cor. 5:19; 1 Tim. 2:6; 1 Tim.
4:10; Titus 2:11,; Heb. 2:9; 2 Peter 2:1; 1 John 2:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For the love of Christ controls us, having concluded
this, that one died for all, therefore all died; and He died for all, so that
they who live might no longer live for themselves, but for Him who died and
rose again on their behalf.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 5:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;who gave Himself as a ransom for all, the testimony given
at the proper time.&quot;  (1 Timothy 2:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to
all men,&quot;  (Titus 2:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But we do see Him who was made for a little while lower
than the angels, namely, Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with
glory and honor, so that by the grace of God He might taste death for
everyone.&quot;  (Hebrews 2:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins; and not
for ours only, but also for those of the whole world.&quot;  (1 John 2:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fourth elective decree was for God the Father, in
eternity past, to deposit into an account for every believer, all of the
blessings that could possibly be conveyed to each Church Age believer if they
were to follow God’s plan for their lives in every way. Knowledge that these
blessings exist for every believer provides motivation for each believer and
the means of glorifying God. Eph. 1:3.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in
Christ,&quot;  (Ephesians 1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As each believer lives his or her life more and more
according to God’s plan, Jesus Christ distributes these blessings to them in
life as they gain spiritual capacity to handle these blessings. Jesus Christ will
also distribute those blessings meant for our eternal life at the Judgment Seat
of Christ. Conveying these eternal blessings also glorifies God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fifth elective decree was the simultaneous decrees of
election and predestination. Election is the expression of the will of God for
you. Election provides equal privilege by making every Church Age believer a
royal priest who are then able to represent themselves before God without any
intermediary as was required in the Old Testament. The Levitical Priesthood
served this function. Equal opportunity for all Church Age believers is
provided by God providing everything we need to live our lives on this earth
with His grace resources for the spiritual life. Eph. 1:4-5.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the
world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him. In love He predestined
us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind
intention of His will,&quot;  (Ephesians 1:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Predestination is the provision of the will of God for
you. Equal privilege is provided by placing every Church Age believer into
union with Christ at the moment of salvation. Equal opportunity is provided to
each believer by being allowed to use the unique spiritual life for the Church
Age. This spiritual life was used by Jesus Christ during His life on earth. It
is provided by God to all Church Age believers and is empowered by the Holy
Spirit. This is the only means provided by God for spiritual advance and
learning God’s purpose and plan for our lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Election and predestination provide both motivation and
the means of living our lives as unto the Lord and thereby living according to
God’s plan with resultant distribution of the blessings God stored away in
eternity past for each one of us.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Application of God's Omniscience To Believers</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God knows what we need and what our desires will be. He
knew them in eternity past. God’s knowledge is infinitely superior to the
greatest genius of the angels or mankind. He knows our decisions. He knows our
thoughts. Job 23:10; John 21:17. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;But He knows the way I take; When He has tried me,
I shall come forth as gold.&quot;  (Job 23:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He said to him the third time, &quot;Simon, son of John,
do you love Me?&quot; Peter was grieved because He said to him the third time,
&quot;Do you love Me?&quot; And he said to Him, &quot;Lord, You know all
things; You know that I love You.&quot; Jesus said to him, &quot;Tend My sheep.
&quot;  (John 21:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God knows our minds and He knows who is a believer and
who is not. God also knows our needs at all times. God’s grace provision is
provided to us to live the spiritual life using His grace resources and
blessings conveyed as we mature spiritually. 2 Tim. 2:19; Matt. 6:31-33; James
1:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Nevertheless, the firm foundation of God stands, having
this seal, &quot;The Lord knows those who are His,&quot; and, &quot;Everyone
who names the name of the Lord is to abstain from wickedness.&quot;&quot;  (2
Timothy 2:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;Do not worry then, saying, 'What will we eat?' or
'What will we drink?' or 'What will we wear for clothing?' &quot;For the
Gentiles eagerly seek all these things; for your heavenly Father knows that you
need all these things. &quot;But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness,
and all these things will be added to you. &quot;  (Matthew 6:31-33, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who
gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to
him.&quot;  (James 1:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Knowledge is imparted to the believer through the Word of
God by the Holy Spirit. 1 Cor. 2:16; Heb. 4:12-13; 1 Cor. 2:9-12; 2 Tim. 2:15;
James 3:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL
INSTRUCT HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For the word of God is living and active and sharper than
any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of
both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the
heart. And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are open
and laid bare to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.&quot;  (Hebrews
4:12-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman
who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth.” (2
Timothy 2:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable,
gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, unwavering, without
hypocrisy.” (James 3:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God, in His omniscience, works all things together for
good to those who love Him. Only God, knowing all things, can work all things
together for good. Rom. 8:28.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And we know that God causes all things to work together
for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His
purpose.&quot;  (Romans 8:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is infinite wisdom and understanding. We cannot say
that no one understands us because God understands us perfectly at all times.
He even understand us better than we do. 1 Sam. 16:7; Psalms 44:21; Psalms
147:5; Prov. 5:21; Isaiah 40:13-14; Jer.17:10; Nahum 1:7; Rom. 8:27; Rom.
11:33.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But the LORD said to Samuel, &quot;Do not look at his
appearance or at the height of his stature, because I have rejected him; for
God sees not as man sees, for man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD
looks at the heart.&quot;&quot;  (1 Samuel 16:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Would not God find this out? For He knows the secrets of
the heart.&quot;  (Psalms 44:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Great is our Lord and abundant in strength; His
understanding is infinite.&quot;  (Psalms 147:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For the ways of a man are before the eyes of the LORD,
And He watches all his paths.&quot;  (Proverbs 5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Who has directed the Spirit of the LORD, Or as His
counselor has informed Him? With whom did He consult and who gave Him
understanding? And who taught Him in the path of justice and taught Him
knowledge And informed Him of the way of understanding?&quot;  (Isaiah
40:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The LORD is good, A stronghold in the day of trouble, And
He knows those who take refuge in Him.&quot;  (Nahum 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The verses above relate God’s infinite nature to His
perfect and absolute knowledge. This means that there never was a time when God
didn't know everything that is knowable about every creature and every natural
phenomena. We all need to understand that there never was a time and never will
be a time when God did not know your every thought, motive, decision, or
action. He knew them all billions and billions of years ago in eternity past.
He even knew of the ridiculous things you would do and why. He also knew all of
the even more ridiculous things you thought of doing, but decided not to do. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God knew all your faults and sins, yet He still gave you your
life with your free will to decide as you would. If He did this, then He must
have a plan for your life. His plan for you is for you to learn and apply all
that you can of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ via the same spiritual life
that Jesus Christ used while on the earth. In order to learn, you must be
tested. While under testing from God, you must always keep His grace provision
in mind and your eternal future with Him in mind. Remember, He always knew
everything about you and what you would need and when. If your life is
unfolding contrary to your plan or expectations, remember that God’s plan for
your life in the best one possible. Maybe you should pursue in earnest His plan
for you. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Perceptions of Contradictions in God’s Plan </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Contradictions cannot exist in God’s plan because it is
perfect. Since God is perfect, a perfect God can only design a perfect plan.
All contradictions in the experience of the believer are contrary to God’s
plan. Therefore, when you function within God’s plan by being filled with the
Holy Spirit, contradictions do not exist. When you reject God’s plan and are
trying your own plan and solutions, you are negative toward Bible doctrine.
Here is when contradictions exist in your experience, but these contradictions
are not a part of God's plan. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Once you see a contradiction in your life between God’s
plan for your life and your experience, then you need to use 1 John 1:9 to
confess known sins in your life and trusting that God will restore you to
fellowship. Then, by applying the doctrine in your soul and claiming God’s
promises, you can now make a decision to eliminate that contradiction.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&quot;  (1 John
1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In grace, perfect God has provided a perfect plan for
imperfect persons. All of us as believers continue to sin after salvation. 1
John 1:5-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;This is the message we have heard from Him and announce
to you, that God is Light, and in Him there is no darkness at all. If we say
that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do
not practice the truth; but if we walk in the Light as He Himself is in the
Light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son
cleanses us from all sin. If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving
ourselves and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, He is faithful
and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all
unrighteousness. If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar and His
word is not in us.&quot;  (1 John 1:5-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Contradictions exist in the experience of believers due
to our wrong decisions made apart from Bible doctrine. Our ignorance of Bible
doctrine in our souls means we are ignorant of God’s plan for our lives.
Ignorance of God’s word means you will not be able to apply the Bible doctrine
in your souls to deal with life’s issues and problems. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When we sin, we lose the enabling power of the Holy
Spirit. By our act of volition, we enter into such things as arrogance,
jealousy, bitterness, hatred, self-pity, revenge motivation, slander, gossip,
maligning, judging, self-righteousness, and legalism. All these result in
contradictions due to wrong decisions from a position of spiritual weakness.
Negative believers are negative toward doctrine and therefore are left to their
own devices, which are most often disastrous. Moreover, we come under God’s discipline
designed to get us to realize we are out of His plan and to get us to confess
known sins in our lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some believers remain out of fellowship for the majority
of their time on this earth. They consistently contradict God’s plan for them
in their experience. On the other hand, some believers remain in fellowship by
always using 1 John 1:9 to return to fellowship. These believers live their
lives closer to what God had planned for them and will have a considerable
impact on those around them and even on the nation. God’s blessing to them will
overflow to those around them to such an extent that a single mature believer
can have a great impact on their families, friends, the company where they
work, their community, state and even their nation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Remember that equal privilege and equal opportunity
provide a basis for having no contradictions in your experience. Under election
and predestination, God provides equal privilege and equal opportunity for all
Church Age believers to fulfill His plan.     </p>
