<h2><a name="_D-God’s_Faithfulness"></a>God’s Faithfulness</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scripture speaks often of God’s faithfulness. To be
faithful is to be reliable, steadfast and unwavering. When God promises that He
will do something, He always does it even when it seems impossible to us. When
He says something will happen in Scripture, it will happen. Because God is
perfect, He cannot ever be unfaithful. If He did even once, He would not be
God, and we could not rely on any of His promises. 1 Kings 8:56; Psalms 89:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Blessed be the LORD, who has given rest to His people
Israel, according to all that He promised; not one word has failed of all His
good promise, which He promised through Moses His servant.” (1 Kings 8:56,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“O LORD God of hosts, who is like You, O mighty LORD? Your
faithfulness also surrounds You.” (Psalms 89:8, NASB</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is eternally reliable, steadfast, and unwavering
because His faithfulness and immutability are two of God's inherent attributes.
God does not have to work at being faithful. He is faithful. Faithfulness is an
essential part of who He is. Heb. 13:8</p>

<p class=Verses>“Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.”
(Hebrews 13:8, NASB))</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Thessalonians 5:24, the phrase “calls you” refers to
the point of time when you accept Jesus Christ as your personal Savior and
appropriate God’s faithfulness. The term “will bring it to pass” refers to the
future or eternity. God has a future for you.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“Faithful is He who calls you, and He also will bring it to
pass.”  (1 Thessalonians 5:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God expresses His faithfulness in many different ways to
the believer. God is faithful to forgive sins. Eternal security is the
faithfulness of God keeping us saved. 1 John 1:9; 2 Tim. 2:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”  (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny
Himself.”  (2 Timothy 2:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The faithfulness of God stabilizes us. God is always
faithful in times of pressure, adversity, and suffering.2 Thess. 3:3; 1 Cor.
10:13; 1 Peter 4:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the Lord is faithful, and He will strengthen and protect
you from the evil one.”  (2 Thessalonians 3:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“No temptation has overtaken you but such as is common to man;
and God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are
able, but with the temptation will provide the way of escape also, so that you
will be able to endure it.”  (1 Corinthians 10:13, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, those also who suffer according to the will of God
shall entrust their souls to a faithful Creator in doing what is right.”  (1
Peter 4:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s faithfulness provides for us under our fellowship
with Jesus Christ. 1 Cor. 1:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“God is faithful, through whom you were called into fellowship
with His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.”  (1 Corinthians 1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is faithful in keeping His promises to us. Heb. 10:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering,
for He who promised is faithful;”  (Hebrews 10:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is faithful in providing for the believers’ eternal
future. 1 Thess. 5:24.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Faithful is He who calls you, and He also will bring it to
pass.”  (1 Thessalonians 5:24, NASB)<a name="_The_Fullness_of"></a><a
name="_The_Plan_of"></a></p>
