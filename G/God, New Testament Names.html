<h2>God, New Testament Names</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God: </b><b><span lang=EL>Θεο</span>́</b><b><span
lang=EL>ς</span><span lang=EL> </span>(Theos)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God used as a generic term. Equivalent to the generic
terms in the Old Testament. Used also of heathen objects of worship. This word
occurs 1,000 times in the New Testament. The majority of uses are for God the
Father. Matt. 14:33; Matt. 15:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And those who were in the boat worshiped Him, saying,
&quot;You are certainly God's Son!&quot;&quot;  (Matthew 14:33, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;For God said, 'HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER,' and,
'HE WHO SPEAKS EVIL OF FATHER OR MOTHER IS TO BE PUT TO DEATH.'&quot;  (Matthew
15:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Christ is also called “God” in Romans 9:5 and with reference
to the Godhead, “Deity” <span lang=EL>θεο</span>́<span lang=EL>της</span><span
lang=EL> </span>(theotēs) in Colossians 2:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;whose are the fathers, and from whom is the Christ
according to the flesh, who is over all, God blessed forever. Amen.&quot; 
(Romans 9:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For in Him all the fullness of Deity dwells in bodily
form,&quot;  (Colossians 2:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Lord: </b><b><span lang=EL>Κυ</span>́</b><b><span
lang=EL>ριος</span><span lang=EL> </span>(Kurios)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Used of man and God. It corresponds to both Adonai and
Jehovah. It indicates ownership and rulership. When it is used for men and
heathen gods, it has a large variety of functions; slave owner, guardian,
husband, and rank. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When it is used, the attitude is like that of Adonai. “I
recognize deity and my relationship to that deity...master/slave relationship.”
Caesar was called Lord, ascribing to him deity and then ownership and worship.
Sovereignty is in view, the right to deal with one’s possessions as he pleases.
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In New Testament doctrine, the title developed into a
personal name for Christ. He is often called just “the Lord” because there is
no other Lord. <i>Kurios</i> is used of Christ in Acts 5:14 and Acts 2:36.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And all the more believers in the Lord, multitudes of men
and women, were constantly added to their number,&quot;  (Acts 5:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Therefore let all the house of Israel know for
certain that God has made Him both Lord and Christ—this Jesus whom you
crucified.&quot;&quot;  (Acts 2:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Kurios</i> is used as “Lord” as God the Father in Acts
4:26 and Acts 4:29. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;'THE KINGS OF THE EARTH TOOK THEIR STAND, AND THE RULERS
WERE GATHERED TOGETHER AGAINST THE LORD AND AGAINST HIS CHRIST.'&quot;  (Acts
4:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;And now, Lord, take note of their threats, and
grant that Your bond-servants may speak Your word with all confidence,&quot; 
(Acts 4:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Lord or Master: </b><b><span lang=EL>Δεσπο</span>́</b><b><span
lang=EL>της</span><span lang=EL> </span>(Despotēs)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is translated Lord or Master. It occurs four times for
Christ in Luke 2:29, 2 Peter 2:1, Jude 1:4, and Revelation 6:10 and one time
for God the Father in Acts 4:24. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Now Lord, You are releasing Your bond-servant to
depart in peace, According to Your word;&quot;  (Luke 2:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But false prophets also arose among the people, just as
there will also be false teachers among you, who will secretly introduce
destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing swift
destruction upon themselves.&quot;  (2 Peter 2:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For certain persons have crept in unnoticed, those who
were long beforehand marked out for this condemnation, ungodly persons who turn
the grace of our God into licentiousness and deny our only Master and Lord,
Jesus Christ.&quot;  (Jude 1:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and they cried out with a loud voice, saying, &quot;How
long, O Lord, holy and true, will You refrain from judging and avenging our
blood on those who dwell on the earth?&quot;&quot;  (Revelation 6:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And when they heard this, they lifted their voices to God
with one accord and said, &quot;O Lord, it is You who MADE THE HEAVEN AND THE
EARTH AND THE SEA, AND ALL THAT IS IN THEM,&quot;  (Acts 4:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Most High God, Most High, The Highest: </b><b><span
lang=EL>Υ</span>̔́</b><b><span lang=EL>ψιστος</span><span lang=EL> </span>(Hupsistos)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Emphasis is on the sovereignty of God the Father in Matthew
21:9, Luke 1:32, and Hebrews 7:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The crowds going ahead of Him, and those who followed,
were shouting, &quot;Hosanna to the Son of David; BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN
THE NAME OF THE LORD; Hosanna in the highest!&quot;&quot;  (Matthew 21:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;He will be great and will be called the Son of the
Most High; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father
David;&quot;  (Luke 1:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most
High God, who met Abraham as he was returning from the slaughter of the kings
and blessed him,&quot;  (Hebrews 7:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Almighty: </b><b><span lang=EL>Παντοκρα</span>́</b><b><span
lang=EL>τωρ</span><span lang=EL> </span>(Pantokratōr)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Reference to God the Father in 2 Corinthians 6:18. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;And I will be a father to you, And you shall be
sons and daughters to Me,&quot; Says the Lord Almighty.&quot;  (2 Corinthians
6:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>References to God the Son. Rev. 21:22; Rev. 4:8; Rev.
11:17; Rev. 15:3; Rev. 16:7; Rev. 16:14; Rev. 19:6; Rev. 19:15; Rev. 1:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God the Almighty and
the Lamb are its temple.&quot;  (Revelation 21:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And I heard the altar saying, &quot;Yes, O Lord God, the
Almighty, true and righteous are Your judgments.&quot;&quot;  (Revelation 16:7,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;I am the Alpha and the Omega,&quot; says the Lord
God, &quot;who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.&quot;&quot; 
(Revelation 1:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Father: </b><b><span lang=EL>Πατη</span>́</b><b><span
lang=EL>ρ</span><span lang=EL> </span>(Patēr)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This always refers to God the Father, the first person of
the Trinity. It indicates His relationship to Christ and the Holy Spirit as
planner and to believers as Father. It is only used in the New Testament in
this capacity. John 1:18; John 5:18; Acts 2:33.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;No one has seen God at any time; the only begotten God
who is in the bosom of the Father, He has explained Him.&quot;  (John 1:18,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For this reason therefore the Jews were seeking all the
more to kill Him, because He not only was breaking the Sabbath, but also was
calling God His own Father, making Himself equal with God.&quot;  (John 5:18,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Therefore having been exalted to the right hand of
God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, He has
poured forth this which you both see and hear.&quot;  (Acts 2:33, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Jesus: </b><b><span lang=EL>Ι</span>̓</b><b><span
lang=EL>ησου</span>͂</b><b><span lang=EL>ς</span><span lang=EL> </span>(Iēsous)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Aramaic and Hebrew equivalent to this is “Joshua”
which means “Jehovah is Salvation.” In Matthew 1:21, an angel gave the
commandment to name the child “Jesus” because He would save His people from
their sins. The emphasis in use is on His humanity, providing salvation. Only
true humanity could do this. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;She will bear a Son; and you shall call His name
Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins.&quot;&quot;  (Matthew 1:21,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Christ: </b><b><span lang=EL>Χριστο</span>́</b><b><span
lang=EL>ς</span><span lang=EL> </span>(Christos)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This means Messiah, anointed and designates Him as
fulfilling Messianic prophecies. He is the Messiah. The emphasis is on His
deity. Jesus Christ puts emphasis on His humanity. Christ Jesus puts emphasis
on His deity. Acts 4:26; Rom. 5:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;'THE KINGS OF THE EARTH TOOK THEIR STAND, AND THE RULERS
WERE GATHERED TOGETHER AGAINST THE LORD AND AGAINST HIS CHRIST.'&quot;  (Acts
4:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For while we were still helpless, at the right time
Christ died for the ungodly.&quot;  (Romans 5:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Son of God: </b><b><span lang=EL>Υι</span>̔</b><b><span
lang=EL>ο</span>́</b><b><span lang=EL>ς</span><span lang=EL> </span></b><b><span
lang=EL>Θεο</span>́</b><b><span lang=EL>ς</span><span lang=EL> </span>(Uihos
Theos)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus never called Himself the Son of God. However, when
others designated Him as the Son of God He accepted it in such a way so as to
assert His claim to it. He called Himself “the Son” in relation to His address
of God as the Father, “My Father.” The title definitely indicates deity. John
5:18; John 10:36-38. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For this reason therefore the Jews were seeking all the
more to kill Him, because He not only was breaking the Sabbath, but also was
calling God His own Father, making Himself equal with God.&quot;  (John 5:18,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;do you say of Him, whom the Father sanctified and sent
into the world, 'You are blaspheming,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God'?
&quot;If I do not do the works of My Father, do not believe Me; but if I do
them, though you do not believe Me, believe the works, so that you may know and
understand that the Father is in Me, and I in the Father.&quot;&quot;  (John
10:36-38, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The emphasis is on His deity and on His positive volition
to do the will of God the Father as having the authority and recognizing the
chain of command. Functions of deity can be found in John 5:21-23, John 5:26, and
John 10:9-11. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;For just as the Father raises the dead and gives
them life, even so the Son also gives life to whom He wishes. &quot;For not
even the Father judges anyone, but He has given all judgment to the Son, so
that all will honor the Son even as they honor the Father. He who does not
honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.&quot;  (John 5:21-23,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;For just as the Father has life in Himself, even so
He gave to the Son also to have life in Himself;&quot;  (John 5:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he will
be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture. &quot;The thief comes only
to steal and kill and destroy; I came that they may have life, and have it
abundantly. &quot;I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life
for the sheep.&quot;  (John 10:9-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Son of Man: </b><b><span lang=EL>Υι</span>̔</b><b><span
lang=EL>ο</span>́</b><b><span lang=EL>ς</span><span lang=EL> </span></b><b><span
lang=EL>Α</span>̓́</b><b><span lang=EL>νθρωπος</span><span lang=EL> </span>(Uihos
Anthrōpos)</b> </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus regularly called Himself by this title. In fact, He
always did so except for two times. John 12:34, Acts 7:56. There is emphasis on
His humanity whether in connection with His ministry, His sacrifice, His
resurrection or His Second Advent. Most often it is used in connection with His
Messianic office. To well informed people, the title would clearly indicate
Messiahship, but not so to the general public. But the title also definitely
identifies Him with mankind and His purpose in ministering to them by way of salvation.
Mark 10:45. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The crowd then answered Him, &quot;We have heard out of
the Law that the Christ is to remain forever; and how can You say, 'The Son of
Man must be lifted up'? Who is this Son of Man?&quot;&quot;  (John 12:34, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and he said, &quot;Behold, I see the heavens opened up
and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.&quot;&quot;  (Acts 7:56,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;For even the Son of Man did not come to be served,
but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.&quot;&quot;  (Mark 10:45,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Lamb, The Lamb of God:</b> <b><span lang=EL>Α</span>̓</b><b><span
lang=EL>μνο</span>́</b><b><span lang=EL>ς</span><span lang=EL> </span></b><b><span
lang=EL>Θεο</span>́</b><b><span lang=EL>ς</span><span lang=EL> </span>(Amnos Theos)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Used 28 times in Revelation. This is a title that always
emphasizes the spiritual death of Christ on the Cross, which provided
forgiveness for sins. John 1:29; John 1:36; Rev. 15:3;, Rev. 22:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said,
&quot;Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!&quot;  (John
1:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and he looked at Jesus as He walked, and said,
&quot;Behold, the Lamb of God!&quot;&quot;  (John 1:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And they sang the song of Moses, the bond-servant of God,
and the song of the Lamb, saying, &quot;Great and marvelous are Your works, O
Lord God, the Almighty; Righteous and true are Your ways, King of the
nations!&quot;  (Revelation 15:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;There will no longer be any curse; and the throne of God
and of the Lamb will be in it, and His bond-servants will serve Him;&quot; 
(Revelation 22:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>King of kings, Lord of lords: </b><b><span lang=EL>Βασιλευ</span>́</b><b><span
lang=EL>ς</span><span lang=EL> </span></b><b><span lang=EL>βασιλευ</span>́</b><b><span

lang=EL>ω</span><span lang=EL> </span>(Basileus basileuō, Kurios kurieuō)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is His Messianic title. It is used for Jesus Christ
in judgment at the Second Advent. 1 Tim. 6:15; Rev. 17:14; Rev. 19:16. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;which He will bring about at the proper time—He who is
the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords,&quot;  (1
Timothy 6:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;These will wage war against the Lamb, and the Lamb
will overcome them, because He is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those
who are with Him are the called and chosen and faithful.&quot;&quot; 
(Revelation 17:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And on His robe and on His thigh He has a name written,
&quot;KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.&quot;&quot;  (Revelation 19:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Lion of Judah: </b><b><span lang=EL>Λεω</span>́</b><b><span
lang=EL>ν</span><span lang=EL> </span></b><b><span lang=EL>Ι</span>̓</b><b><span
lang=EL>ουδα</span>́</b><b><span lang=EL>ς</span><span lang=EL> </span>(Leōn
Ioudas)</b> </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Root of David, birthright by physical birth. Rev. 5:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and one of the elders said to me, &quot;Stop weeping;
behold, the Lion that is from the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has
overcome so as to open the book and its seven seals.&quot;&quot;  (Revelation
5:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Light: </b><b><span lang=EL>Φω</span>͂</b><b><span
lang=EL>ς</span><span lang=EL> </span>(Phōs)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Refers to Jesus Christ. John 1:7; John 8:12; John 3:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He came as a witness, to testify about the Light, so that
all might believe through him.&quot;  (John 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then Jesus again spoke to them, saying, &quot;I am the
Light of the world; he who follows Me will not walk in the darkness, but will
have the Light of life.&quot;&quot;  (John 8:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;This is the judgment, that the Light has come into
the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds
were evil.&quot;  (John 3:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Bread of Life: </b><b><span lang=EL>α</span>̓́</b><b><span
lang=EL>ρτος</span><span lang=EL> </span></b><b><span lang=EL>ζωη</span>́ (artos

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Eating the bread = receiving Christ. Drinking the blood =
receiving Christ. John 6:35; John 6:48. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Jesus said to them, &quot;I am the bread of life; he who
comes to Me will not hunger, and he who believes in Me will never
thirst.&quot;  (John 6:35, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;I am the bread of life.&quot;  (John 6:48, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Eating the living bread is receiving Christ as Savior.
John 6:51. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;I am the living bread that came down out of heaven;
if anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever; and the bread also which I
will give for the life of the world is My flesh.&quot;&quot;  (John 6:51, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Refers to Jesus Christ as true God and as the Creator.
John 1:1-3; John 1:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,
and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came into
being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being that has come
into being.&quot;  (John 1:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw
His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Rock: </b><b><span lang=EL>Πε</span>́</b><b><span

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The “Rock” in the New Testament is used only four times.
In all instances, it refers to the Lord Jesus Christ. In Matthew 16:18, “the
rock” does not refer to Peter (Petros), but to Jesus Christ the rock (πέτρα or
petra). The Church is built on Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is the chief
cornerstone.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this
rock I will build My church; and the gates of Hades will not overpower
it.&quot;  (Matthew 16:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is the rock that delivered Israel from Egypt
and guided them for 40 years. 1 Cor. 10:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and all drank the same spiritual drink, for they were
drinking from a spiritual rock which followed them; and the rock was
Christ.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 10:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is the cornerstone. Eph. 2:20; 1 Peter 2:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;having been built on the foundation of the apostles and
prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the corner stone,&quot;  (Ephesians 2:20,
NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For this is contained in Scripture: &quot;BEHOLD, I LAY
IN ZION A CHOICE STONE, A PRECIOUS CORNER stone, AND HE WHO BELIEVES IN HIM
WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.&quot;&quot;  (1 Peter 2:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is the chief cornerstone. Luke 20:17. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But Jesus looked at them and said, &quot;What then is
this that is written: 'THE STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS REJECTED, THIS BECAME THE

to this doom they were also appointed.&quot;  (1 Peter 2:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;just as it is written, &quot;BEHOLD, I LAY IN ZION A
