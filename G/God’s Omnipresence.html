<h2><a name="_D-God’s_Omnipresence"></a>God’s Omnipresence</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Omnipresence means that God is present everywhere at the
same time. Another word for omnipresence is ubiquity. All created beings,
including angels, can only be in one place at one time. Material things occupy
some specific part of space, but do not occupy all space. Space is defined as
the infinite extension of the three-dimensional field in which all matter
exists or the expanse in which the solar system, stars, and galaxies exist,
otherwise known as the universe. God created this universe and is therefore not
subject to it nor limited by it. This is called immensity and means that God
surpasses all of His creation and extends beyond without end. The heavens
cannot contain God. He was present outside the universe when He created it. 1
Kings 8:27; Acts 17:24.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold,
heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain You, how much less this house
which I have built!&quot;  (1 Kings 8:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;The God who made the world and all things in it,
since He is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with
hands;&quot;  (Acts 17:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Omnipresence does not imply that God is spread out or
diffused throughout the universe in that only part of Him is everywhere. This
is erroneous thinking. He is wholly present as fully as if He were in only one
place. God completely fills the entire universe and all aspects of it without
diffusion, expansion, multiplication, or division. The Father, Son, and Holy
Spirit are fully present in every minute part of God's infinite dominion. This
is known as God’s immanence. God is everywhere and in all things simultaneously
in His totality and with all of His perfect attributes.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If space is that outer boundary of the universe, then
God’s presence exceeds this boundary by infinity. This aspect of God’s
omnipresence or infinite presence is called transcendence. God is transcendent
which means He is infinitely above all of his creatures, the universe, and the
heavens which He created. God is both immanent and transcendent. Jer. 23:23-24;
Acts 17:27. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Am I a God who is near,&quot; declares the LORD,
&quot;And not a God far off? &quot;Can a man hide himself in hiding places So I
do not see him?&quot; declares the LORD. &quot;Do I not fill the heavens and
the earth?&quot; declares the LORD.&quot;  (Jeremiah 23:23-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;that they would seek God, if perhaps they might grope for
Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us;&quot;  (Acts 17:27,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is not reasonable for the human finite mind to suppose
that it can fully comprehend the omnipresence of God. Psalms 139:6; Psalms
73:23-24. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; It is too high,
I cannot attain to it.&quot;  (Psalms 139:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Nevertheless I am continually with You; You have taken
hold of my right hand. With Your counsel You will guide me, And afterward
receive me to glory.&quot;  (Psalms 73:23-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God fills all of space and every moment of time as it
passes with His presence. God also sustains everything and gives it purpose and
value. God is the Lord of both time and history. God does not negate time, but
fulfills it.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Application of God’s Omnipresence to the Believer</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One very important aspect of God’s omnipresence is that
God indwells all believers in the Church Age. All Church Age believers are
indwelt by the Trinity, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Psalms
139:7-12.   </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Where can I go from Your Spirit? Or where can I flee from
Your presence? If I ascend to heaven, You are there; If I make my bed in Sheol,
behold, You are there. If I take the wings of the dawn, If I dwell in the
remotest part of the sea, Even there Your hand will lead me, And Your right
hand will lay hold of me. If I say, &quot;Surely the darkness will overwhelm
me, And the light around me will be night,&quot; Even the darkness is not dark
to You, And the night is as bright as the day. Darkness and light are alike to
You. &quot;  (Psalms 139:7-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Christian can take great comfort in the omnipresence
of God. His continual presence in all things should be abundant consolation to
believers. The following verses speak of God’s promises to Israel and to each
of us. They also speak of the mental attitude of confidence we should have in
God’s ability to keep His promises. He has said that He is present when two or
more assemble for the intake of Bible doctrine. God has promised that He will
always be with us in every possible situation. There is no greater
encouragement for the believer under testing. Gen. 28:15; Exodus 33:14; Psalms
121:3-4; Joshua 1:9; Matt. 18:20; Heb. 13:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever
you go, and will bring you back to this land; for I will not leave you until I
have done what I have promised you.&quot;&quot;  (Genesis 28:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He said, &quot;My presence shall go with you, and I
will give you rest.&quot;&quot;  (Exodus 33:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He will not allow your foot to slip; He who keeps you
will not slumber. Behold, He who keeps Israel Will neither slumber nor
sleep.&quot;  (Psalms 121:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous!
Do not tremble or be dismayed, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you
go.&quot;&quot;  (Joshua 1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;For where two or three have gathered together in
My name, I am there in their midst.&quot; &quot;  (Matthew 18:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; Make sure that your character is free from the love of
money, being content with what you have; for He Himself has said, &quot;I WILL
NEVER DESERT YOU, NOR WILL I EVER FORSAKE YOU,&quot;&quot;  (Hebrews 13:5,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Man cannot escape the presence of God. If you think you
can run from God, you don’t know Him. Job 34:21-22; Prov. 15:3.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;For His eyes are upon the ways of a man, And He
sees all his steps. &quot;There is no darkness or deep shadow Where the workers
of iniquity may hide themselves.&quot;  (Job 34:21-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The eyes of the LORD are in every place, Watching the
evil and the good.&quot;  (Proverbs 15:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some people think that if they get out of line and do
something wrong, it won’t be so bad if they do it in another area so as not to
damage their credibility at work or at home. They might be able to hide it from
other people, but they can’t hide it from God.  Psalms 139:7-12 says it very
well.  The pastor might not see you, loved ones might not see you, friends
might not see you, but God is right on the scene. One of the good things about
growing spiritually is you develop virtue and strength of character.  D.L.
Moody said, “Character is what a person is in the dark.”  Dark and light are
all alike to God. He’s on the scene.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Where can I go from Your Spirit? Or where can I flee from
Your presence? If I ascend to heaven, You are there; If I make my bed in Sheol,
behold, You are there. If I take the wings of the dawn, If I dwell in the
remotest part of the sea, Even there Your hand will lead me, And Your right
hand will lay hold of me. If I say, &quot;Surely the darkness will overwhelm
me, And the light around me will be night,&quot; Even the darkness is not dark
to You, And the night is as bright as the day. Darkness and light are alike to
You. &quot;  (Psalms 139:7-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>No matter how far you go out in space or even into
heaven, God is there. God is in His heaven, God is throughout space, God is
throughout our stratosphere, our ionosphere, and atmosphere. God is everywhere
even in the depths of the ocean and in the depths of the earth. You cannot hide
from God and God never hides from any of us.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The omnipresence of God should sober us up and make us realize
that we can’t get away with anything. God knew your life’s entire history with
all of the sordid details in eternity past. He knows all about you. It’s
encouraging to know that God guides each of us. Psalms 31:3</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For You are my rock and my fortress; For Your name's sake
You will lead me and guide me.&quot;  (Psalms 31:3, NASB)</p>
