<h2><a name="_The_Plan_of_1"></a><a name="_D-Plan_of_God"></a><a
name="_Plan_of_God"></a>The Plan of God</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is perfect, therefore His plan is perfect. God’s plan
always existed from eternity past and was designed for His imperfect creatures.
It is the sovereign right of God to make plans for His creatures. Psalms 24:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“A Psalm of David. The earth is the LORD'S, and all it
contains, The world, and those who dwell in it.” (Psalms 24:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In His perfect sovereignty, He chose to give all of His
creatures a free will. The free will of man or volition was created by God for
the execution of God’s plan. Free will, whether positive or negative, was
anticipated and incorporated into God’s divine purpose. The plan continues to
unfold exactly as God foreknew in eternity past regardless of man’s failures to
follow divine guidance and His grace provision.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s perfect plan is intimately linked to God’s essence.
To fully understand God's plan, you must first understand who He is and what
are His characteristics or attributes. See category on the <a
href="#_Essence_of_God">Essence of God</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The plan of God is perfect and is given by a perfect and
absolute God. If man, who is imperfect, can add to God's plan, then the plan would
be imperfect. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God provides the means and the power for the believer to
fulfill His plan. The power is in the enabling power of God the Holy Spirit.
When we are filled with the Spirit we can execute God's plan as He intended.
Eph. 5:18; Gal. 5:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but
be filled with the Spirit,” (Ephesians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the
desire of the flesh.” (Galatians 5:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To understand His plan, we must grow in grace and
knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. We can only do this by the consistent
intake and application of Bible doctrine via the grace apparatus for
perception. 2 Peter 3:18; Heb. 4:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory, both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.”
(2 Peter 3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any
two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of
both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the
heart.” (Hebrews 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One of the biggest problems in understanding God's plan
is that His plan can only be executed using His grace resources and while being
filled with the Holy Spirit. That means we can do nothing of merit from our own
physical capabilities, our intellect, our own accomplishments, or our earned
wealth. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We need to stop trying to help God out with our own way
of doing things. He doesn’t need our help. He wants us to accept the work of
Jesus Christ on the Cross and then to use His grace resources to accomplish His
will, His way. He conveys blessings to those who do so during their time on
earth and in eternity. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Savior Jesus Christ</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Savior Jesus Christ was Prophesied in the Old
Testament </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The plan of God provided a Savior for sinful mankind. The
Savior, Jesus Christ was prophesied in the Old Testament. He would be of the
human race. He would be of the seed of Abraham. Gen. 3:15; Gen. 12:1-3. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And I will put enmity Between you and the woman, And between
your seed and her seed; He shall bruise you on the head, And you shall bruise
him on the heel.&quot;” (Genesis 3:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now the LORD said to Abram, &quot;Go forth from your country,
And from your relatives And from your father's house, To the land which I will
show you; And I will make you a great nation, And I will bless you, And make
your name great; And so you shall be a blessing; And I will bless those who
bless you, And the one who curses you I will curse. And in you all the families
of the earth will be blessed.&quot;” (Genesis 12:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Savior, Jesus Christ would be of the Tribe of Judah.
He would be like unto the prophet Moses. Gen. 49:10; Deut. 18:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;The scepter shall not depart from Judah, Nor the ruler's
staff from between his feet, Until Shiloh comes, And to him shall be the
obedience of the peoples.” (Genesis 49:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like
me from among you, from your countrymen, you shall listen to him.” (Deuteronomy
18:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He would be the Son of King David. He was to be born in
Bethlehem. 2 Sam. 7:16; Micah 5:2. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Your house and your kingdom shall endure before Me
forever; your throne shall be established forever.&quot;'&quot;” (2 Samuel
7:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But as for you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, Too little to be
among the clans of Judah, From you One will go forth for Me to be ruler in
Israel. His goings forth are from long ago, From the days of eternity.&quot;”
(Micah 5:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Savior, Jesus Christ would be virgin born. He would
have certain names. Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:6. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold,
a virgin will be with child and bear a son, and she will call His name
Immanuel.” (Isaiah 7:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us; And
the government will rest on His shoulders; And His name will be called
Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.” (Isaiah 9:6,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He would die on the Cross for the sins of humanity. He
would be resurrected from the dead. Isaiah 53. </p>

<p class=Verses>“He was despised and forsaken of men, A man of sorrows and
acquainted with grief; And like one from whom men hide their face He was
despised, and we did not esteem Him. Surely our griefs He Himself bore, And our
sorrows He carried; Yet we ourselves esteemed Him stricken, Smitten of God, and
afflicted.” (Isaiah 53:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But He was pierced through for our transgressions, He was
crushed for our iniquities; The chastening for our well-being fell upon Him,
And by His scourging we are healed. All of us like sheep have gone astray, Each
of us has turned to his own way; But the LORD has caused the iniquity of us all
To fall on Him.” (Isaiah 53:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, I will allot Him a portion with the great, And He
will divide the booty with the strong; Because He poured out Himself to death,
And was numbered with the transgressors; Yet He Himself bore the sin of many,
And interceded for the transgressors.” (Isaiah 53:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Angels Instructed Regarding the Incarnation of Jesus
Christ </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The angel Gabriel instructed Zacharias, the father of
John the Baptist that his wife Elizabeth would give birth to the herald or
forerunner of the Messiah. Luke 1:11-20. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing to the
right of the altar of incense. Zacharias was troubled when he saw the angel,
and fear gripped him. But the angel said to him, &quot;Do not be afraid,
Zacharias, for your petition has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear
you a son, and you will give him the name John.” (Luke 1:11-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The angel Gabriel instructed the virgin Mary that she
would conceive via the Holy Spirit and thereby give birth to the humanity of
the Lord Jesus Christ. Luke 1:26-38. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to
a city in Galilee called Nazareth, to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was
Joseph, of the descendants of David; and the virgin's name was Mary. And coming
in, he said to her, &quot;Greetings, favored one! The Lord is with you.&quot;”
(Luke 1:26-28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The angel said to her, &quot;Do not be afraid, Mary; for you
have found favor with God. &quot;And behold, you will conceive in your womb and
bear a son, and you shall name Him Jesus.” (Luke 1:30-31, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Mary said to the angel, &quot;How can this be, since I am a
virgin?&quot; The angel answered and said to her, &quot;The Holy Spirit will
come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; and for that
reason the holy Child shall be called the Son of God.” (Luke 1:34-35, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An angel of the Lord instructed the shepherds in the
fields. Luke 2:8-15.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“In the same region there were some shepherds staying out in
the fields and keeping watch over their flock by night. And an angel of the
Lord suddenly stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them;
and they were terribly frightened. But the angel said to them, &quot;Do not be
afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be for all
the people; for today in the city of David there has been born for you a
Savior, who is Christ the Lord.” (Luke 2:8-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An angel of the Lord instructed Joseph in his dreams.
Matt. 1:20-23; Matt. 2:13-15; Matt. 2:19-20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But when he had considered this, behold, an angel of the Lord
appeared to him in a dream, saying, &quot;Joseph, son of David, do not be
afraid to take Mary as your wife; for the Child who has been conceived in her
is of the Holy Spirit. &quot;She will bear a Son; and you shall call His name
Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins.&quot;” (Matthew 1:20-21,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now when they had gone, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared
to Joseph in a dream and said, &quot;Get up! Take the Child and His mother and
flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you; for Herod is going to search
for the Child to destroy Him.&quot;” (Matthew 2:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But when Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in
a dream to Joseph in Egypt, and said, &quot;Get up, take the Child and His
mother, and go into the land of Israel; for those who sought the Child's life
are dead.&quot;” (Matthew 2:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Entrance into God's Plan - Salvation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first stage of the plan of God is salvation.
Salvation belief in the work of Jesus Christ on the Cross is the only entrance
into God's plan. The work for salvation was accomplished at the Cross and by
personal faith in Jesus Christ, we have eternal life. Jesus Christ went to the Cross
and became our substitute. Every sin we have ever committed actually went to
court at the Cross. Our sins were poured out on the humanity of Jesus Christ
and they were judged by God the Father. Because all sins were judged, the
barrier between man and God was removed. Now, all that stands between man and
God is the person of the Lord Jesus Christ and our attitude toward Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s will regarding salvation is expressed in 2 Peter
3:9. God wants all to change their mind (repentance) regarding the person of
the Lord Jesus Christ and believe in His work on their behalf. In eternity
past, God made a sovereign decision to allow man to have free will. In His
immutability, He cannot coerce man’s free will. </p>

<p class=Verses>“The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some count
slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing for any to perish but for all
to come to repentance.” (2 Peter 3:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Positive volition is expressed through a non-meritorious
system of perception known as faith. By a simple act of non-meritorious faith,
anyone can enter into salvation in Jesus Christ. Acts 16:31. </p>

<p class=Verses>“They said, &quot;Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be
saved, you and your household.&quot;” (Acts 16:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God treats man in grace at salvation. Eph. 2:8-9; Eph.
1:6-7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not
of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one
may boast.” (Ephesians 2:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely
bestowed on us in the Beloved. In Him we have redemption through His blood, the
forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace” (Ephesians
1:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>How do you fit into God’s plan? First, through personal
faith in Christ and then through spiritual growth using God's grace resources
and the enabling power of the Holy Spirit. This results in the production of
divine good. Anything done without the filling of the Holy Spirit is human good
and is unacceptable to God.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God's Grace Provision</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s divine policy for God’s plan in the Church Age is grace.
Grace means God does all the work and man receives the benefit of that work.
Divine good is produced when the believer is filled with the Holy Spirit and
uses only God's grace resources to live the spiritual life. We have never done
anything to earn or deserve blessing from God. Grace means that God does all
the work. Man receives the blessing from God for producing divine good. Eph.
3:2; John 1:16; John 1:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“if indeed you have heard of the stewardship of God's grace
which was given to me for you;” (Ephesians 3:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon
grace.” (John 1:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw His
glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.”
(John 1:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has provided salvation through His Son and provides
grace resources in the spiritual life. Acts 4:33; Phil. 1:7; 2 Cor. 9:8; Rom.
12:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And with great power the apostles were giving testimony to the
resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and abundant grace was upon them all.” (Acts
4:33, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For it is only right for me to feel this way about you all,
because I have you in my heart, since both in my imprisonment and in the
defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of grace with
me.” (Philippians 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that
always having all sufficiency in everything, you may have an abundance for
every good deed;” (2 Corinthians 9:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For through the grace given to me I say to everyone among you
not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think; but to think so as
to have sound judgment, as God has allotted to each a measure of faith.”
(Romans 12:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God's Power Provided</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divine power excludes human power. Human power has no
place in God's plan for your life. Human power is unequal, unstable and
unreliable. All believers have an equal opportunity to understand the Word of
God, since it has nothing to do with different human intelligence, abilities,
or genetics. Eph. 3:20-21</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly beyond all
that we ask or think, according to the power that works within us, to Him be
the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and
ever. Amen.” (Ephesians 3:20-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Only divine power provides equality for all believers to
fulfill the plan of God. Church Age believers are provided this divine power to
fulfill God's plan for their life. 2 Cor. 4:7; Eph. 1:19-20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, so that the
surpassing greatness of the power will be of God and not from ourselves;” (2
Corinthians 4:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us
who believe. These are in accordance with the working of the strength of His
might which He brought about in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead and
seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places,” (Ephesians 1:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The link between the power of God and the use of divine
power is Bible doctrine. God makes His perfect plan work in the lives of
believers as we use that divine power that is the Holy Spirit’s teaching
ministry in the Church Age. 1 Cor. 2:9-10. </p>

<p class=Verses>“but just as it is written, &quot;THINGS WHICH EYE HAS NOT SEEN
AND EAR HAS NOT HEARD, AND which HAVE NOT ENTERED THE HEART OF MAN, ALL THAT
GOD HAS PREPARED FOR THOSE WHO LOVE HIM.&quot; For to us God revealed them
through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of
God.” (1 Corinthians 2:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divine power is manifest in the grace apparatus for
perception, whereby the Holy Spirit teaches you Bible doctrine. The filling of
the Holy Spirit also enables the application of Bible doctrine to life’s
situations and decision making. John 16:12-14.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I have many more things to say to you, but you cannot
bear them now. &quot;But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you
into all the truth; for He will not speak on His own initiative, but whatever
He hears, He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come. &quot;He
will glorify Me, for He will take of Mine and will disclose it to you.” (John
16:12-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divine power is a basis for the spiritual life and is the
essence of spiritual freedom. 2 Peter 1:3; Eph. 3:20; John 8:32; 2 Cor. 3:17-18;
Gal. 5:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“seeing that His divine power has granted to us everything
pertaining to life and godliness, through the true knowledge of Him who called
us by His own glory and excellence.” (2 Peter 1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly beyond all
that we ask or think, according to the power that works within us,” (Ephesians
3:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you
free.&quot;” (John 8:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord
is, there is liberty. But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror
the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to
glory, just as from the Lord, the Spirit.” (2 Corinthians 3:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“It was for freedom that Christ set us free; therefore keep
standing firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery.” (Galatians
5:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Faith-Rest</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Faith-rest is based on daily doctrinal intake and
application of <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine to experience. Faith-rest
produces steadiness while in fellowship. The central source for faith-rest for
the new believer and all believers is the Word of God as promises, principles
and doctrines. Isaiah 33:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He will be the stability of your times, A wealth of
salvation, wisdom and knowledge; The fear of the LORD is his treasure.&quot; 
(Isaiah 33:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The faith-rest life begins with a maximum exposure to the
truth of the Word of God, but it must be applied to life. The central purpose
of faith-rest is to bring steadiness into the believer’s life of fellowship. The
basis of faith-rest is  the believer’s permanent relationship to Jesus Christ  Positional
Truth – the top circle of the illustration below. To Grow spiritually, you must
be in fellowship with God where the Holy Spirit controls the soul – the bottom
circle. Rom. 8:1; Rom. 14:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in
Christ Jesus.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 8:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But he who doubts is condemned if he eats, because his eating
is not from faith; and whatever is not from faith is sin.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
14:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses><img border=0 width=550 height=300
src="The%20Plan%20of%20God1.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Faith-rest is from perfect God. No human deed or work can
be added to perfect divine provision. Hence, the believer must cease from their
deeds, human good, and enter into a rest where they do no work – the Holy
Spirit does the work. Heb. 3:12-14; Heb. 3:18-19; Heb. 4:1-3; Heb. 4:10-11. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Take care, brethren, that there not be in any one of you an
evil, unbelieving heart that falls away from the living God. But encourage one
another day after day, as long as it is still called “Today,” so that none of
you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. For we have become partakers
of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our assurance firm until the end,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews
3:12-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And to whom did He swear that they would not enter His rest,
but to those who were disobedient? So we see that they were not able to enter
because of unbelief.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 3:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, let us fear if, while a promise remains of entering
His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short of it. For indeed we have
had good news preached to us, just as they also; but the word they heard did
not profit them, because it was not united by faith in those who heard. For we
who have believed enter that rest, just as He has said, “AS I SWORE IN MY
WRATH, THEY SHALL NOT ENTER MY REST,” although His works were finished from the
foundation of the world.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 4:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the one who has entered His rest has himself also rested
from his works, as God did from His. Therefore let us be diligent to enter that
rest, so that no one will fall, through following the same example of
disobedience.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 4:10-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Therefore, every believer is the product of their own
decisions whether they are good or bad.  Good decisions line up with God
promises and are done in the power of the Holy Spirit. Bad decisions are
contrary to the God promises, are not made in the power of the Holy Spirit, and
will incur divine discipline. Every believer has spiritual freedom and is
provided the grace resources to execute God’s plan for their life. See category

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Authority Orientation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A believer cannot maintain and continue spiritual growth
unless they are authority oriented. Learning Bible doctrine requires authority
orientation to the Word of God and the pastor-teacher  communicating that
doctrine. Perception of doctrine using the grace apparatus for perception is
the only way to advance spiritually. Such perception absolutely demands
authority orientation. You cannot just read your Bible for yourself and
understand the Bible doctrine contained in it. That's why God has given the
spiritual gift of pastor-teacher. Eph. 4:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and
some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers,&quot;  (Ephesians 4:11,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The greater the authority over people, the greater the
responsibility to people. No matter how high we go in life, there is always
higher authority that must be recognized in order to perpetuate humility as
orientation to life. Authority is not only a bona fide concept in Christianity,
but in society as well.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Authority orientation depends on free will to function.
Human freedom allows us to accept or reject any form of authority in life, both
legitimate and illegitimate. Although legitimate authority is divinely
delegated through both the laws of divine establishment and the Word of God,
these forms of legitimate authority mean nothing without human acceptance of
them. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Illegitimate authority is based on mankind's arrogance
from their old sin natures and the influence of Satan’s world system of evil.
This arrogance rejects legitimate authority in life and is the source of evil
in this world. Rejection of authority causes people to degenerate, either
morally or immorally.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Children rejecting the authority of their parents leads
to rejection of other forms of authority such as the teacher, the coach, the
police officer, etc. Their attitude toward their parent’s authority when in the
home determines whether they will mature or not and whether they will continue
that arrogant rejection of authority into other areas of life. Predominant
rejection of authority of parents destroys a society.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Rejection of a legitimate government’s authority is
destructive to a nation, a state, a city, or even a group. Rejection of some
forms of authority may lead to criminality. Such people reject the authority of
the police officer, the judge on the bench, and of management. This also
results in self-induced misery. Such miserable people also make those around
them miserable.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When we choose to orient to legitimate authority, we are
blessed both individually and collectively. However, when people through
arrogance use their free will to make decisions from arrogance to reject
legitimate authority, it has both personal and national repercussions.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are all products of our own decisions. Good decisions
by orienting to legitimate authority produces a capacity for life. Bad
decisions by rejecting legitimate authority will ruin their lives. Col. 3:25,
Hosea 8:7, Gal. 6:7, Prov. 22:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For he who does wrong will receive the consequences of
the wrong which he has done, and that without partiality.&quot;  (Colossians
3:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For they sow the wind And they reap the whirlwind. The
standing grain has no heads; It yields no grain. Should it yield, strangers
would swallow it up.&quot;  (Hosea 8:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man
sows, this he will also reap.&quot;  (Galatians 6:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He who sows iniquity will reap vanity, And the rod of his
fury will perish.&quot;  (Proverbs 22:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Human freedom allows each of us to accept or reject both
legitimate and illegitimate authority in life. Legitimate authority is
delegated by God. Illegitimate authority is based on arrogance and Satan’s
world system of evil. Arrogance rejects legitimate authority in life.<span

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Communication of the Word</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Bible doctrine is the only source of divine wisdom by
which we learn what God's plan is for our life and how to use God’s power to
fulfill His plan. Your pastor-teacher is the divinely delegated authority for
the communication of Bible doctrine. Bible teaching from your pastor-teacher
will clarify God’s plan, purpose, and will for your life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>From authority orientation originates objectivity and
teachability for spiritual growth. You must remain objective in your attitude
toward your pastor-teacher. That means you should not regard your pastor as
either friend or enemy or as a personality, but only as the communicator of
Bible doctrine. It is the Word of God being communicated that counts, not the
person behind the pulpit. You are not designed to learn the Bible on your own.
You are designed to learn under authority. That authority is related to the
local church with the pastor as the final authority.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The system of communication for God's plan is based on
the Scripture. The inerrant Word of God in the original languages is inspired
by God. This is called verbal-plenary inspiration of the Scripture. God
inspired the human authors to record in writing the exact record of the mind
and the will of God as He intended it to be.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The books of the Bible include every book of an
acknowledged messenger of God who was commissioned of God to make known His
will and was accepted immediately as the Word of God. Deut. 31:24-26; Joshua
1:8; John 5:39; 2 Tim. 2:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“It came about, when Moses finished writing the words of this
law in a book until they were complete, that Moses commanded the Levites who
carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying, “Take this book of the law
and place it beside the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may
remain there as a witness against you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Deuteronomy 31:24-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““This book of the law shall not depart from your mouth, but
you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do
according to all that is written in it; for then you will make your way
prosperous, and then you will have success.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Joshua 1:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you
have eternal life; it is these that testify about Me;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 5:39,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman
who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth.” (2
Timothy 2:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Titus 1:3, “but at the proper time manifested” means
to make something known by teaching, authoritative preaching constantly
repeated. Note that “proclamation” is committed to a few men with a spiritual
gift. Never was it committed to a woman. “According to the commandment of God
our Savior” refers to Bible doctrine as God's perfect standard.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“but at the proper time manifested, even His word, in the
proclamation with which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God our
Savior,” (Titus 1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>How do you get maximum doctrine? By responding to communication
leadership in your pastor-teacher and by responding with positive volition to the
Bible doctrine he communicates to you.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Confession of Sin</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God's plan includes the grace means of recovering the
power of the spiritual life – the filling of the Holy Spirit. This grace means
is confession of sin biblically where the believer cites or names to God the
Father their known sins. It is admitting to the God the Father that what you
have thought, said, or done is sin. The believer realizes that this is sin
based on the Bible doctrine in the right lobe (heart) of their soul. 1 John 1:9
is addressed to believers only.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&quot;  (1 John
1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 John 1:9 , the word “If” is a third class condition
in the Greek and means that it is potential,  maybe the believer will confess
known sins biblically, maybe they won’t. But if they do, then the Lord is always
faithful and just to forgive them the sins they remembered and named and to
cleanse them from all unrighteousness including the sins they forgot or were
unaware of.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Confession means to recognize that sin named as one that
has been paid for on the Cross. Confession is the non-meritorious method of
dealing with family type sins. Confession is only made to God the Father,
because God alone can forgive sin. Mark 2:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Why does this man speak that way? He is
blaspheming; who can forgive sins but God alone?&quot;&quot;  (Mark 2:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are to trust that the Word of God will identify what
God says is sin as part of the Bible doctrine that we learn and apply in our
Christian walk. God has provided this “grace” way of being cleansed from all
unrighteousness (sins that you did not know of) just by naming your known sins.
This is His grace! See category on <a href="#_Confession_of_Sin">Confession of
Sin</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><a name="_Old_Sin_Nature_1"></a><b>The Old Sin Nature</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer in a state of sin where the soul is controlled
of the old sin nature is called carnality. The genetically-formed old sin
nature is in every cell in the body and is the source of temptation to sin, but
the source of sin is your volition which is part of your soul. After salvation,
the believer continues to possess their old sin nature and therefore, continues
to sin. 1 John 1:8; Rom. 5:12; Rom. 7:14-15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves and
the truth is not in us.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 John 1:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world,
and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned—”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
5:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For we know that the Law is spiritual, but I am of flesh, sold
into bondage to sin. For what I am doing, I do not understand; for I am not
practicing what I would like to do, but I am doing the very thing I hate.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
7:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The carnal believer under the control of the old sin
nature is described in Romans 7:18-20 and 1 Corinthians 3:1-3. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my
flesh; for the willing is present in me, but the doing of the good is not. For
the good that I want, I do not do, but I practice the very evil that I do not
want. But if I am doing the very thing I do not want, I am no longer the one
doing it, but sin which dwells in me.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 7:18-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual men,
but as to men of flesh, as to infants in Christ. I gave you milk to drink, not
solid food; for you were not yet able to receive it. Indeed, even now you are
not yet able, for you are still fleshly. For since there is jealousy and strife
among you, are you not fleshly, and are you not walking like mere men?”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Corinthians 3:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The old sin nature frustrates bona fide divine good production
in the life of the believer. Rom. 7:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For while we were in the flesh, the sinful passions, which
were aroused by the Law, were at work in the members of our body to bear fruit
for death.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 7:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The old sin nature is acquired genetically from the
father’s chromosomes. Psalms 51:5; Rom. 5:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world,
and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned—”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
5:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, And in sin my mother
conceived me.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 51:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are four main characteristics that make up the old
sin nation. The Area of Weakness produces sins. The Area of Strength produces
human good. The Lust Pattern and Trends produce Antinomianism and Legalism. See
category on the <a href="#_Old_Sin_Nature">Old Sin Nature.</a></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Spiritual Life </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The plan of God provides a spiritual life for every
believer. The believer must live their spiritual life based on the decisions
they make and the Bible doctrine resident in their soul. No one can live your
spiritual life but you. The guidance and knowledge by which you must live the
spiritual life can only be derived from the Word of God. People’s opinions and
secular knowledge provide nothing in the spiritual life. The intake and
application of Bible doctrine must have number one priority.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has provided His unlimited grace resources whereby we
may represent Him on earth while executing the plan of God for our lives. His
grace resources include the filling of the Holy Spirit, confession of sin, the Divine
Institutions and other techniques for living the Christian life. Eph. 5:18; 1
John 1:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but
be filled with the Spirit,” (Ephesians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every Church Age believer is an ambassador for Jesus
Christ while on earth. Acts 1:8; 2 Cor. 3:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon
you; and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and
Samaria, and even to the remotest part of the earth.&quot;” (Acts 1:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“being manifested that you are a letter of Christ, cared for by
us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets
of stone but on tablets of human hearts.” (2 Corinthians 3:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s will for every believer is to stay in fellowship a
maximum amount of time, be filled with the Holy Spirit and grow spiritually by
using God's grace resources. This is how God wants you live the Christian way
of life. There are believers in every generation who will come to realize that
God has a plan and spiritual life for them. This puts a tremendous emphasis on
your awareness and on your volition to make the plan and spiritual life
applicable in your living.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You must be aware of the fact that God has a plan for
your life and this plan is revealed in detail in the New Testament Scriptures.
Nothing is left out. No one can make you be aware of God’s plan for your life.
You must do this for yourself. Awareness of the power of God’s plan comes with
learning about the ministry of God the Holy Spirit controlling your soul and
providing the spiritual resources and power to live the spiritual life.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Through daily consistent residence in the spiritual life,
under the enabling power of the Holy Spirit, the believer is able to understand
and establish the right priorities for the execution of the plan of God, to be
properly motivated, and to possess a right scale of values.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You cannot fulfill the plan of God for your life by
imitating and thinking motives, decisions, and functions of others. Borrowing
their personality, their habits, or their functions become a huge  distraction from
the spiritual life. Your spiritual life comes into focus through awareness and
understanding of Bible doctrine that provides a renewing of your thinking that
results in a divine viewpoint of life. Rom. 12:2; Eph. 1:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by
the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that
which is good and acceptable and perfect.” (Romans 12:2, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, so that
you will know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory
of His inheritance in the saints,” (Ephesians 1:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The key to the spiritual life and Christian service is
the intake and application of <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine. The source of
Christian service is related to your spiritual gift, your priesthood, and your ambassadorship.
You have your very own spiritual life whether you like it or not. Nothing has
greater value than your spiritual life. The one thing you will take with you
into eternity is the <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in your soul. Spiritual
maturity results in obtaining the “fullness of God.” Eph. 3:18-19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the
breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ which
surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God.”
(Ephesians 3:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Stability of God's Plan – Eternal Security</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The instant you believed in the substitutionary spiritual
death of Jesus Christ for all of your sins, the Holy Spirit entered you into
union with the Lord Jesus Christ. This is called the Baptism of the Holy Spirit
and Positional Truth. It is a permanent position in Christ and there can be no
condemnation for any believer placed into union with Jesus Christ. This means
that you have a standing before God which is exactly the same as the Lord Jesus
Christ. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In our relationship with Jesus Christ, we share
everything the Lord Jesus has at the right hand of God the Father. We share His
absolute righteousness, His eternal life, His priesthood, His election, His
destiny, and His heirship. No one or thing is able to change that relationship.
This happens at the moment of salvation, the moment we accept Christ as our
Savior. Salvation is the first phase of God’s plan for our life. John 10:28-30.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; and I give eternal life to them, and they will never
perish; and no one will snatch them out of My hand. &quot;My Father, who has
given them to Me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of
the Father's hand. &quot;I and the Father are one.&quot; &quot;  (John
10:28-30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You must understand that no matter how much you fail or
how much you succeed, you are still in God’s plan. In Titus 1:2, “the hope” is <span
lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>λπι</span>́<span lang=EL>ς</span> (elpis) and
means with the utmost of confidence. The tragedy is that the modern word for
“hope” tends to mean “I hope so” or “it could happen.” Believers in the Church
Age are to have an absolute confidence in their eternal life. </p>

<p class=Verses>“in the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie,
promised long ages ago,” (Titus 1:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What is your confidence to be based on? The Word of God.
God guarantees eternal life at the moment of belief. You are not put on
probation, so relax. You have eternal life the moment you believe and you can’t
be thrown out. You will receive divine discipline from God’s love when you stay
in a state of sin (carnality), but you will always be a member of the family of
God. If you remain in reversionism for a very long time and God chooses to remove
you from the earth through the sin unto death, you are still in the family of
God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Titus 1:2, “which God, who cannot lie” means that God cannot
ever lie because of His perfect essence. Therefore, you can have confidence in
Him. He levels with you and tells you the truth. You may not like someone who
always tells the truth, but you have to respect them.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Wherein does reality lie? In what God says. If you have
believed in Jesus Christ, you have eternal life even though you may not feel
like it. In Titus 1:2, “promised long ages ago” refers to a time before the
times of the ages – eternity past. This means to promise to undertake and
underwrite you was made before creation of the universe. Billions of years ago,
knowing what type of a person you would be, he underwrote you. We don’t earn
it, and we don’t deserve it. You can’t fool God at any time. See category on <a
href="#_Eternal_Security">Eternal Security</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Divine Solutions vs. Human Solutions</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Christian way of life was designed for you to
personally resolve your own problems and make your own decisions before God
without interference from others. God has divine solutions, but you must become
aware of them.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has designed a grace solution to every problem in
life for every believer. This solution was provided in eternity past and is
recorded in the Word of God. Divine solutions can only be exercised through learning
and applying <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine under the ministry of God the Holy
Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To solve problems, you must concentrate on the <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine in the right lobe of your soul. You cannot think about yourself
and use God's grace resources. You become spiritually strong by the filling of
the Holy Spirit plus the teaching ministry of God the Holy Spirit. You utilize
divine power by having the confidence in the Lord Jesus Christ and His Word and
then applying the doctrine in your soul especially under tough circumstances or
when tough decisions must be made. 2 Cor. 12:9; Eph. 3:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He has said to me, &quot;My grace is sufficient for you,
for power is perfected in weakness.&quot; Most gladly, therefore, I will rather
boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me.” (2
Corinthians 12:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly beyond all
that we ask or think, according to the power that works within us,” (Ephesians
3:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Power of Prayer</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Prayer must be directed only to God the Father, (Eph.
5:20; Matt. 6:9; 1 Peter 1:17) in the name of God the Son (John 14:13; John
15:16) and in the power of the Holy Spirit. Eph. 6:18. A believer is never to
pray to the Holy Spirit or to pray to our Lord Jesus Christ. Prayer is
empowered by the Holy Spirit. Prayer is made in the name of the Son.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;always giving thanks for all things in the name of our
Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father;&quot;  (Ephesians 5:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;Pray, then, in this way: 'Our Father who is in
heaven, Hallowed be Your name. &quot;  (Matthew 6:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If you address as Father the One who impartially judges
according to each one's work, conduct yourselves in fear during the time of
your stay on earth; &quot;  (1 Peter 1:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;Whatever you ask in My name, that will I do, so
that the Father may be glorified in the Son. &quot;  (John 14:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;You did not choose Me but I chose you, and
appointed you that you would go and bear fruit, and that your fruit would
remain, so that whatever you ask of the Father in My name He may give to you.
&quot;  (John 15:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;With all prayer and petition pray at all times in the
Spirit, and with this in view, be on the alert with all perseverance and
petition for all the saints,&quot;  (Ephesians 6:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Prayer is a believer’s petition and/or desire directed to
God the Father, while the believer is filled with the Holy Spirit, either
mentally or verbally, personally or collectively, based on His Word. Prayer
involves claiming God’s promises and His thinking to effect His will. John
15:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, ask whatever
you wish, and it will be done for you.”  (John 15:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every Church Age believer is a priest and therefore represents
themselves before God personally. Heb. 4:16.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore let us draw near with confidence to the throne of
grace, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.”
(Hebrews 4:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You cannot offer prayer to coerce a person’s volition,
but you can offer prayer that God will make a person aware of certain things,
such as the Gospel. Awareness is always the key in our prayers for others. Eph.
3:16-19. See category on <a href="#_D-Prayer">Prayer</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory,
to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inner man, so that
Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; and that you, being rooted and
grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the
breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ which
surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God.”
(Ephesians 3:16-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Spiritual Production</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God's plan for every believer is to make use of His grace
resources and the filling of the Holy Spirit to produce divine good. Everything
done while filled with the Holy Spirit is considered by God to be divine good
production. Because every believer is in full time Christian service, this time
spent in the spiritual life is dependent on the believer’s volition.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Legalism is the believer doing work in carnality with
their soul controlled by their sin nature. This work is called human good and
the best the carnal believer can produce. While such human production may seem
beneficial, philanthropic and good from a human perspective, it is all done
apart from God and His grace resources. None of it is acceptable to God. Human
good is also the best that the unbeliever can produce. God completely rejects
all of it as though it was “a filthy garment.” Isaiah 64:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For all of us have become like one who is unclean, And all our
righteous deeds are like a filthy garment; And all of us wither like a leaf,
And our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.” (Isaiah 64:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Rewards and Blessing</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In God's plan, God conveys blessings to the believer
consistent with their spiritual growth and their production of divine good.
These blessings or rewards are provided during the believer’s time on earth and
in eternity. These blessings were available in eternity past with the
believer’s volition being the only obstacle between all that God could have
provided in blessing and what became reality in the believer’s life while on
earth. Rom. 9:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He did so to make known the riches of His glory upon
vessels of mercy, which He prepared beforehand for glory,” (Romans 9:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer can have a significant impact in others’
lives. They can affect others in their periphery from God's blessings to them as
an overflow – blessing by association. This blessing can and does overflow to
the community, the state, and the country you live in. This blessing can extend
through missionaries to other nations. See category on <a href="#_D-Rewards">Rewards</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God's Plan in Eternity</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The final stage of the Plan of God is the believer in eternity.
We will spend eternity with Him in a place prepared by God for each of us. We
will be at home for eternity. 2 Cor. 5:8; John 14:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“we are of good courage, I say, and prefer rather to be absent
from the body and to be at home with the Lord.” (2 Corinthians 5:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again
and receive you to Myself, that where I am, there you may be also.” (John 14:3,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In eternity past, God provided for each of us all the
grace resources and power we would ever need to fulfill His plan for our lives.
We are to live our lives with our promised eternal future in mind. With this
confidence and trust in God in the spiritual life, the believer can handle
anything. See category on <a href="#_Eternity">Eternity</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Attempts to Thwart The Plan of God</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>By Cutting Off its Personnel to Temporarily Disable It</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Cutting off of the Messiah in Daniel 9. Cutting off the
pure human race in Genesis 6. Saul’s attempt to cut off David in 1 Samuel. Absalom’s
and Ahithophel’s attempts to cut off David in 2 Samuel 12 through 2 Samuel 15.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Counsel of Balaam to cut off power of Israel and God’s
use of them as the administrator of national discipline in Numbers 25. Imprisonment
of the disciples and apostles by temporary incapacitation in the book of Acts.
Killing of John the Baptist in Matthew 14. Attacking the plan of God was
expressed in attacking the people.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>By Suggesting Premature Decisions</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is the attempt by others to harmonize God’s plans
for you with their own ingenious plans, of course, not with your interests in
mind. The hunger of Christ was legitimate and it was normal to want to satisfy
it. The plan of presentation in Glory was a real part of the Father’s plan, but
the timing and procedure of Satan was wrong. The acquisition of the kingdom by
Christ was legitimate, but completely wrong if taken in this premature way. Matt.
4.</p>
