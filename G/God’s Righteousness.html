<h2><a name="_D-God’s_Righteousness"></a><a name="_God’s_Righteousness"></a>God’s
Righteousness</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s righteousness is absolute moral perfection and
absence of all sin or contact with anything less than perfect righteousness
equal to His own. Divine righteousness is the absolute standard by which God
judges all of His created beings. Psalms 119:137. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; Tsadhe. Righteous are You, O LORD, And upright are Your
judgments.&quot;  (Psalms 119:137, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is infinitely holy and perfectly righteous in all of
His ways. His righteousness is evident in all of His attributes. This is
because God’s righteousness prevents any compromise of His perfect justice.
God’s perfect justice prevents any compromise of His other attributes from any
source. Deut. 32:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;The Rock! His work is perfect, For all His ways are
just; A God of faithfulness and without injustice, Righteous and upright is
He.&quot;  (Deuteronomy 32:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To be “righteous” means to be acting in accordance with
all of God’s laws and statutes and without sin or guilt. Because God is perfect
in all of His attributes, God’s righteousness is perfect, eternal,
unchangeable, and absolute. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Righteousness Related to Justice</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s righteousness is always related to His justice.
God's perfect righteousness can only contact perfect righteousness. God's
perfect justice demands perfectly fair justice in all cases. God administers
justice to His created beings based on the perfect and absolute principles of
His righteousness. Whatever His righteousness requires to remain perfect, His
justice performs. If any thought or action of any created being does not
measure up to His perfect righteousness, then God’s justice must judge that “unrighteousness.”
This is called sin. Conversely, if any thought or action is in accordance with
His perfect righteousness, then His justice must provide blessing. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For example, if we sin in any way either consciously or
from ignorance, God’s righteousness must condemn that sin and His justice must
provide punishment for it. As believers, God’s justice disciplines us to get us
to return to the filling of the Holy Spirit through confession of sin. When we
do something by either thought or action while filled with the Spirit, the
righteousness of God demands that we be blessed by the justice of God. As we
grow spiritually, God must provide greater grace blessing accordingly.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Unbelievers remain under condemnation from the justice of
God because they have not accepted the perfect saving work of Jesus Christ.
Without God’s perfect righteousness given at the point of salvation faith
belief, they can never have any relationship with God. They will receive the
same perfectly fair punishment from His justice as the fallen angels will
receive – eternal separation from God in the Lake of Fire.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is the righteous ruler over all of His creation and
as such, He is the only just dispenser of rewards and punishments. God’s
perfect righteousness makes Him the only perfectly qualified judge in
existence. The perfect justice of God cannot be unfair or prejudiced and cannot
make a false judgment. This is because the standard of judgment is always God’s
own perfect righteousness. Isaiah 6:3; Dan. 9:14; Psalms 145:17; Lev. 19:2; 1
Sam. 2:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And one called out to another and said, &quot;Holy, Holy,
Holy, is the LORD of hosts, The whole earth is full of His glory.&quot;&quot; 
(Isaiah 6:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Therefore the LORD has kept the calamity in store
and brought it on us; for the LORD our God is righteous with respect to all His
deeds which He has done, but we have not obeyed His voice.&quot;  (Daniel 9:14,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The LORD is righteous in all His ways And kind in all His
deeds.&quot;  (Psalms 145:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Speak to all the congregation of the sons of Israel
and say to them, 'You shall be holy, for I the LORD your God am holy.&quot; 
(Leviticus 19:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;There is no one holy like the LORD, Indeed, there
is no one besides You, Nor is there any rock like our God.&quot;  (1 Samuel
2:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s perfect righteousness makes His character perfect
as are all of His other attributes. God has revealed many of His righteous
actions and judgments. We as believers are to conform to His plan through Bible
doctrine in our soul and thereby to grow in knowledge of Him. Psalms 7:9; Rom.
1:17; Psalms 11:7; Psalms 111:3; Rom. 10:3; 1 John 2:29.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;O let the evil of the wicked come to an end, but
establish the righteous; For the righteous God tries the hearts and
minds.&quot;  (Psalms 7:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith
to faith; as it is written, &quot;BUT THE RIGHTEOUS man SHALL LIVE BY
FAITH.&quot;&quot;  (Romans 1:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For the LORD is righteous, He loves righteousness; The
upright will behold His face.&quot;  (Psalms 11:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Splendid and majestic is His work, And His righteousness
endures forever.&quot;  (Psalms 111:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If you know that He is righteous, you know that everyone
also who practices righteousness is born of Him.&quot;  (1 John 2:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God’s Justice Can Only Bless Perfect Righteousness</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The righteousness and justice of God guarantee that God
will always be consistently fair and impartial in dealing with His creatures.
God’s justice provides whatever His righteousness demands – in all cases. There
has never been a time that His justice provided either blessing or punishment
without perfect input from His righteousness. God’s righteousness first
confirms the need for either blessing or punishment, then signals the justice
of God to execute what is required. Therefore, there is nothing that mankind
can do to alter or corrupt God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God cannot bless mankind when they only possess an old
sin nature. There is no target for blessing, only a target for punishment. When
we accept the perfect saving work of Jesus Christ on the Cross, we receive the
imputation of His perfect righteousness as one of 40 things God gives each
believer at the moment of salvation. This imputation is perfect and permanent.
Whatever God’s righteousness accepts, His justice will bless. Therefore, all blessing
is from the justice of God directly to the righteousness of God in us, not to
us personally. God blesses us because of what He is, not what we are.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God’s Righteousness and Mankind</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has always been totally free from sin. God cannot
tempt or solicit any created being to sin. God cannot be involved in sin in any
way. God’s righteousness can only condemn sin. God’s justice can only judge sin.
This is why Jesus Christ had to become perfect and sinless humanity to be
qualified to be judged in our place for all of the sins of the human race. 2
Cor. 5:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so
that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.&quot;  (2 Corinthians
5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s absolute righteousness cannot have a relationship
with any creature that has anything less than perfect and absolute
righteousness. God’s absolute righteousness cannot have fellowship with sinful
man. Psalms 111:9, Isaiah 6:3, Isaiah 59:2. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He has sent redemption to His people; He has ordained His
covenant forever; Holy and awesome is His name.&quot;  (Psalms 111:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And one called out to another and said, &quot;Holy, Holy,
Holy, is the LORD of hosts, The whole earth is full of His glory.&quot;&quot; 
(Isaiah 6:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But your iniquities have made a separation between you
and your God, And your sins have hidden His face from you so that He does not
hear.&quot;  (Isaiah 59:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As perfect and absolute righteousness, God rejects all
forms of righteousness that do not measure up to His perfect righteousness.
This means that all forms of human righteousness cannot ever measure up to
God’s perfect standard. Isaiah 64:6 tells us exactly where human righteousness
will get us with God.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For all of us have become like one who is unclean, And
all our righteous deeds are like a filthy garment; And all of us wither like a
leaf, And our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.&quot;  (Isaiah 64:6,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Man's concept of righteousness is relative to what is
learned, observed or experienced in life. No human being, except Jesus Christ,
has ever had the capability to measure up to God’s absolute divine standard of
righteousness by themselves. Psalms 14:3; Rom. 3:23; Titus 3:5. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;They have all turned aside, together they have become
corrupt; There is no one who does good, not even one.&quot;  (Psalms 14:3,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of
God,&quot;  (Romans 3:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done
in righteousness, but according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration
and renewing by the Holy Spirit,&quot;  (Titus 3:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Jesus Christ’s Sinless Perfection and The Cross</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ was perfectly sinless (impeccable)
throughout His life here on earth. His humanity remained perfectly sinless even
while He was being physically tortured prior to being nailed to the Cross. He
never even had a single mental attitude sin though it all! He never once called
on His deity to get him out of a jam. His human nature remained absolutely
perfect and sinless, thus maintaining moral perfection. The enabling power of
the Holy Spirit sustained Him as the Holy Spirit does for every believer in the
Church Age. The spiritual life of Jesus Christ sustained him as He paid for our
sins on the Cross. This is the very same enabling power in the spiritual life
that each and every believer possesses. The only thing standing in our way of
using this power is our free will decision to do so. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It goes back to that moment of salvation when you
received Jesus Christ as your Savior. The Baptism of the Holy Spirit (baptism
means identification) entered you into union with the Lord Jesus Christ. In
union with the Lord Jesus Christ, you share the righteousness of God
positionally. You will never be perfectly sinless in this life because you were
born with Adam’s original sin and with a genetically-formed old sin nature.
However, when your soul is controlled by the Holy Spirit, you are by definition
in a sinless state. Once you decide to sin mentally or by action, you
immediately lose the filling of the Holy Spirit and sin in a state of carnality
where your old sin nature controls your soul. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When we’re filled with the Holy Spirit, we’re not
controlled by the old sin nature. When we’re controlled by the old sin nature,
we’re not filled with the Holy Spirit. When we’re filled with the Holy Spirit
and growing under Bible doctrine, we grow spiritually and learn to make use of
the Holy Spirit’s power within to stay in fellowship a maximum amount of the
time on a daily basis.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As you grow spiritually, you will be in fellowship a
greater percentage of the time. The new believer is out of fellowship most of
the time. The mature believer remains in fellowship most of the time. But you
will never come to the place where you do not convert temptation into sin. Only
Jesus Christ lived a life of perfection. The only thing we can do to receive
eternal salvation is to express non-meritorious faith in the perfect
substitutionary work of Jesus Christ on the Cross. This is faith alone in Christ
alone. When you do that, you’re immediately in union with Christ and you share
His righteousness. 2 Cor. 5:21; Rom. 3:22.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so
that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.&quot;  (2 Corinthians
5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus
Christ for all those who believe; for there is no distinction;&quot;  (Romans
3:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For those who think they can get to heaven on their own
by keeping the Mosaic Law, Galatians 2:16 and Romans 3:23 are very clear. For
those who think they can get to heaven on their own by being very moral and
good to others, Isaiah 64:6 has an even clearer message. Everyone sins with the
exception of Jesus Christ who is the only way to eternal life and a
relationship with God.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;nevertheless knowing that a man is not justified by the
works of the Law but through faith in Christ Jesus, even we have believed in
Christ Jesus, so that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the
works of the Law; since by the works of the Law no flesh will be
justified.&quot;  (Galatians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of
God,&quot;  (Romans 3:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For all of us have become like one who is unclean, And
all our righteous deeds are like a filthy garment; And all of us wither like a
leaf, And our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.&quot;  (Isaiah 64:6,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is both perfect humanity and the perfect
undiminished God the Son who is co-equal with God the Father and God the Holy
Spirit.  The triune God is absolute righteousness and cannot be unrighteous or
unfair. God’s absolute righteousness was satisfied with Christ’s work on the Cross.
Therefore, the focal point in all of creation is the Cross. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God’s Blessings Target His Imputed Righteousness In Us</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All blessing from God to the believer is imputed from the
justice of God to His indwelling righteousness that we all received at the
moment of salvation. All divine discipline or punishment also comes from the
justice of God. In either case, what the justice of God sends to us is based on
how we measure up compared to the perfect righteousness of God. If we measure
up because we are filled with the Holy Spirit and producing divine good by our
thoughts and actions, we are blessed from the justice of God. Alternatively,
when we are in carnality, we receive divine discipline from God’s justice to
turn us back to the spiritual life. Whatever the righteousness of God rejects by
either mental attitude or action contrary to His perfect righteousness, the
justice of God must condemn. Divine discipline brings to our attention that we
need to confess our sins per 1 John 1:9 and again be filled with the Holy
Spirit. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&quot;  (1 John
1:9, NASB)</p>
