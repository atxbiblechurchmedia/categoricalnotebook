<h2><a name="_D-God’s_Omnipotence"></a>God’s Omnipotence</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The omnipotence of God is the infinite or limitless power
of God. His unlimited power is employed in all that He wills. Much of what God
does is from His volition and apart from any other means. God simply wills it
or speaks and it is done. When God the Son created the universe, He spoke and
it appeared out of nothing. Psalms 33:9; Psalms 148:5. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For He spoke, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood
fast.&quot;  (Psalms 33:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Let them praise the name of the LORD, For He commanded
and they were created.&quot;  (Psalms 148:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This act alone exceeds our finite comprehension and
overwhelms our human faculties. Further, for God to create the universe and
everything in it required no effort on His part. Isaiah 40:26; Job 26:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Lift up your eyes on high And see who has created these
stars, The One who leads forth their host by number, He calls them all by name;
Because of the greatness of His might and the strength of His power, Not one of
them is missing.&quot;  (Isaiah 40:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;He stretches out the north over empty space And
hangs the earth on nothing.&quot;  (Job 26:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In contrast, the will of man is restricted to thoughts,
purpose, free will decisions, and physical actions. Man can never cause
anything to exist by the force of his will. God’s ability to create the
universe out of nothing all from the force of His will is the most magnificent
and unfathomable manifestation of His limitless power. No other such power has
ever existed. Only God possesses such power. All things are possible with God.
So, when things in life look impossible from our perspective, we should always
remember that to God, nothing is impossible. Matt. 19:26.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And looking at them Jesus said to them, &quot;With people
this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.&quot; &quot; 
(Matthew 19:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is able to do whatever He wills, but He may not will
to do all that His omnipotence can accomplish. God is infinitely able to do all
things that He desires to do, but must at all times be consistent with His
perfect attributes or essence. Isaiah 43:13 shows that God not only has the
power to do all that He wills, but nothing is able to reverse what He does.
Because God is perfect, nothing He does ever needs to be improved or undone. Omnipotence
is exclusively an attribute of God which is essential to the perfection of His
essence or being. God cannot contradict Himself. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Even from eternity I am He, And there is none who
can deliver out of My hand; I act and who can reverse it?&quot;&quot;  (Isaiah
43:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Omnipotence Related to God’s Other Attributes</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God's infinite and limitless power is controlled by His
divine volition, which is His sovereignty.  Divine sovereignty functions under
infinite, eternal, and perfect virtue and wisdom. Omnipotence emphasizes the
eternal supremacy of God’s power. Because God has limitless power, He is always
in control of all things at all times. His sovereignty is backed by His
omnipotence. God can make and back every promise He ever made. We can trust in
His promises as Abraham did in Genesis 17:1-2, because He is all powerful and
limitless in ability.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now when Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD
appeared to Abram and said to him, &quot;I am God Almighty; Walk before Me, and
be blameless. &quot;I will establish My covenant between Me and you, And I will
multiply you exceedingly.&quot;&quot;  (Genesis 17:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is infinite and eternal. Therefore, His power is
infinite and eternal. God exists eternally in three persons who are co-infinite
and co-eternal. Each person of the Godhead has identical unlimited power or
omnipotence. Because God has always and will remain perfect, He is able to do
anything which is compatible with His divine essence, but nothing that is
contrary to it. For example, God cannot use His power to ever compromise
regarding sin, evil, or human good.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God won't violate His perfect justice by making one of
our wrong decisions into a correct decision. He has never abused His unlimited
power. As we all know, man’s history is filled with examples of human beings
abusing their power. This is because they are imperfect and have sin natures.
God is perfect and limits Himself because of His own perfect attributes and by
His plan for mankind. Therefore, He can do all that He wills to do, but cannot
do all that He is capable of. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Sharing of God’s Power to The Believer </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s most profound sharing of His limitless divine power
in human history is the grace provision of the omnipotence of God to every
Church Age believer in order to live God's plan, purpose, and will for their
lives. God’s omnipotence or divine power is related to believers in the Church
Age in many ways. In no other dispensation before the Church Age has God's
power been made available to all believers. Eph. 1:19-21; Phil. 4:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward
us who believe. These are in accordance with the working of the strength of His
might which He brought about in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead and
seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places, far above all rule and
authority and power and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in
this age but also in the one to come.&quot;  (Ephesians 1:19-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I can do all things through Him who strengthens
me.&quot;  (Philippians 4:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The omnipotence of God the Father is related to the
blessings He set aside for every believer in eternity past. He is the author of
the perfect plan for our lives and constructed the spiritual life as the means
for living that plan while making use of a maximum amount of His divine power
and grace resources.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The omnipotence of God the Holy Spirit was only available
to a very few believers in the Old Testament times. Only a privileged few
believers were given the use of divine power under the enduement ministry of
the Holy Spirit. God has delegated more power to the individual believer in the
Church Age than ever before in human history. The power of the Word of God
resident in your soul is infinitely greater than the power of the miracles and
the manifestations in the Old Testament. The greatest believer of the Old
Testament, Moses, longed to see our day.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The divine power that raised Jesus Christ from the dead
is the same power available to each believer under the filling of the Holy
Spirit. This power is made available more and more as we mature spiritually
because we are thinking the same way that Jesus Christ thought during His
incarnation. By doing so, we are thinking the same way that God the Son thought
from eternity past. The power of the Word of God has never before in history been
provided like this. 1 Cor. 2:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL
INSTRUCT HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Whether you use this divine power or not depends on your
free will decisions to learn and apply Bible doctrine. The omnipotence of God
the Holy Spirit is also available to us as He is our teacher and mentor. John
14:26; John 16:12-15; 1 Cor. 2:9-15. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father
will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your
remembrance all that I said to you. &quot;  (John 14:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;I have many more things to say to you, but you
cannot bear them now. &quot;But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will
guide you into all the truth; for He will not speak on His own initiative, but
whatever He hears, He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come.
&quot;He will glorify Me, for He will take of Mine and will disclose it to you.
&quot;All things that the Father has are Mine; therefore I said that He takes
of Mine and will disclose it to you. &quot;  (John 16:12-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;but just as it is written, &quot;THINGS WHICH EYE HAS NOT
SEEN AND EAR HAS NOT HEARD, AND which HAVE NOT ENTERED THE HEART OF MAN, ALL
THAT GOD HAS PREPARED FOR THOSE WHO LOVE HIM.&quot; For to us God revealed them
through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.
For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the spirit of the man
which is in him? Even so the thoughts of God no one knows except the Spirit of
God. Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is
from God, so that we may know the things freely given to us by God, which
things we also speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught
by the Spirit, combining spiritual thoughts with spiritual words. But a natural
man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness
to him; and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually appraised.
But he who is spiritual appraises all things, yet he himself is appraised by no
one.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 2:9-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The omnipotence of God the Son - Jesus Christ, the divine
power that holds the universe together, is also available to further the plan
of God the Father for every Church Age believer.  This is why human history
continues in spite of man's evil and in spite of anything man and Satan do to
wipe out the human race. There will always be many people on planet earth
regardless of any disaster. Mankind cannot and will not be destroyed. This is
guaranteed by the promises of the deity of Jesus Christ and backed by His
omnipotence. There is no weapon that man can invent that will wipe out the
human race or destroy the universe. Mankind will continue through to the end of
the Millennium when God Himself will destroy the present universe and create
the New heavens and New Earth. Rev. 21:1-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first
heaven and the first earth passed away, and there is no longer any sea. And I
saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, made
ready as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the
throne, saying, &quot;Behold, the tabernacle of God is among men, and He will
dwell among them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself will be among
them, and He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there will no longer
be any death; there will no longer be any mourning, or crying, or pain; the
first things have passed away.&quot;&quot;  (Revelation 21:1-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Many believers live their lives thinking they are
operating according to God’s will. However, most have never sought to know
exactly what His plan or will really is for their lives. Still others, upon
hearing Bible doctrine that does not fit their idea of what God’s plan should
be, reject what God wants and continue operating on human abilities and human
power gained through their own efforts. Many believers and even pastors never
escape their preferred use of their own human abilities instead of God’s enabling
power. They even call their own abilities divine power through arrogance.
However, this power is all based on their abilities, not the power of God the
Holy Spirit. This is because they have never given priority to learning,
accepting, believing and applying the whole realm of the Word of God, Bible
doctrine. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The divine power given to us is for the greatest
opportunity for spiritual growth and effectiveness ever given to individual
believers in any time of human history. All things are possible because God has
unlimited, infinite, eternal divine power. Matt.19:26; Luke 1:37.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And looking at them Jesus said to them, &quot;With people
this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.&quot; &quot; 
(Matthew 19:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;For nothing will be impossible with
God.&quot;&quot;  (Luke 1:37, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God’s Omnipotence and the Resurrection of Jesus Christ</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The physical death of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
was absolutely unique. His human spirit went into the presence of God the
Father in the third heaven. His human soul went to a part of Hades in the heart
of the earth called Paradise. His human body went into the grave. This was the
only trichotomous (body, soul, and human spirit) separation in physical death
in all of human history. Luke 23:46; Psalms 16:10; Luke 23:43; Eph. 4:9-10; Luke
23:53.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And Jesus, crying out with a loud voice, said,
&quot;Father, INTO YOUR HANDS I COMMIT MY SPIRIT.&quot; Having said this, He
breathed His last.&quot;  (Luke 23:46, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For You will not abandon my soul to Sheol; Nor will You
allow Your Holy One to undergo decay.&quot;  (Psalms 16:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He said to him, &quot;Truly I say to you, today you
shall be with Me in Paradise.&quot; &quot;  (Luke 23:43, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;(Now this expression, &quot;He ascended,&quot; what does
it mean except that He also had descended into the lower parts of the earth? He
who descended is Himself also He who ascended far above all the heavens, so
that He might fill all things.)&quot;  (Ephesians 4:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And he took it down and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and
laid Him in a tomb cut into the rock, where no one had ever lain.&quot;  (Luke
23:53, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Father was an agent in our Lord's resurrection by
using His omnipotence to restore our Lord’s human spirit to His body in the
grave. Rom. 6:4; Eph. 1:19-20; Col. 2:12; 1 Thess. 1:10; 1 Peter 1:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore we have been buried with Him through baptism
into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the
Father, so we too might walk in newness of life.&quot;  (Romans 6:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward
us who believe. These are in accordance with the working of the strength of His
might which He brought about in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead and
seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places, &quot;  (Ephesians
1:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;having been buried with Him in baptism, in which you were
also raised up with Him through faith in the working of God, who raised Him
from the dead.&quot;  (Colossians 2:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and to wait for His Son from heaven, whom He raised from
the dead, that is Jesus, who rescues us from the wrath to come.&quot;  (1
Thessalonians 1:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;who through Him are believers in God, who raised Him from
the dead and gave Him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.&quot;  (1
Peter 1:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Holy Spirit was an agent in our Lord's
resurrection by using His omnipotence to restore our Lord’s human soul to His
body in the grave. Rom. 1:4; Rom. 8:11; 1 Peter 3:18. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;who was declared the Son of God with power by the
resurrection from the dead, according to the Spirit of holiness, Jesus Christ
our Lord,&quot;  (Romans 1:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead
dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to
your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you.&quot;  (Romans 8:11,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For Christ also died for sins once for all, the just for
the unjust, so that He might bring us to God, having been put to death in the
flesh, but made alive in the spirit;&quot;  (1 Peter 3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This same divine power will be used to resurrect all dead
believers at the Rapture of the Church. 1 Cor. 15:42-44.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown a
perishable body, it is raised an imperishable body; it is sown in dishonor, it
is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; it is sown a
natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there
is also a spiritual body. &quot;  (1 Corinthians 15:42-44, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The omnipotence of God the Son could have raised Himself
from the dead. While the deity of Christ could have raised His own humanity
from the dead, there is no record in the Bible that He did so. John 10:17-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;For this reason the Father loves Me, because I lay
down My life so that I may take it again. &quot;No one has taken it away from
Me, but I lay it down on My own initiative. I have authority to lay it down,
and I have authority to take it up again. This commandment I received from My
Father.&quot; &quot;  (John 10:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord voluntarily restricted the independent use of
all of His divine and unlimited attributes while here on earth prior to His
physical death on the Cross. He did not use any of His divine attributes
including His omnipotence to benefit Himself, to provide for Himself, to
glorify Himself, or to raise Himself from the dead. He did this in compliance
with the Father's plan for His life. Instead, He relied on the power of God the
Father and of God the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hypostatic Union means that when Jesus Christ was
born physically, He was undiminished deity and true humanity in one person
forever. At the instant that He took His first breath as a human being, our
Lord Jesus Christ was a baby in the cradle in His humanity, but in His deity,
He was using His omnipotence to continue to hold the universe together. Also,
while He was on the Cross being judged for the sins of the world in His
humanity, He continued to use His deity to hold the universe together. Heb. 1:3-4;
Col. 1:16-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He is the radiance of His glory and the exact
representation of His nature, and upholds all things by the word of His power.
When He had made purification of sins, He sat down at the right hand of the
Majesty on high, having become as much better than the angels, as He has
inherited a more excellent name than they.&quot;  (Hebrews 1:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For by Him all things were created, both in the heavens
and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or
authorities—all things have been created through Him and for Him. He is before
all things, and in Him all things hold together.&quot;  (Colossians 1:16-17,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ maintained this voluntary restriction
perfectly even under greater testing than we will ever know. In so doing, His
humanity never sinned - even once. He was able to do this because He was always
filled with the enabling power of the Holy Spirit. This is why we are able to
handle anything in life through the intake and application of Bible truth and
resultant growth in the spiritual life. Our spiritual life is the exact same
spiritual life that Jesus Christ lived under all possible circumstances.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God’s Omnipotence in the Church Age</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Your faith should not depend on those around you or what
you can learn from them. Your faith should stand on God’s omnipotence. Paul was
trying to tell the Corinthians that in approaching God, they should not depend
on the empirical knowledge or wisdom acquired through education. Human
knowledge is woefully insufficient. Only non-meritorious faith perception of
God’s Word through the enabling power of the Holy Spirit will work. God’s
unlimited knowledge and power are the solutions we should seek. 1 Cor. 2:4-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and my message and my preaching were not in persuasive
words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, so that your
faith would not rest on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God.&quot;  (1
Corinthians 2:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers in the Church Age have been endowed with God’s
omnipotence when filled with the Holy Spirit and applying God’s truth to
situations in our lives. This results in courage and stability under pressure
and sharing God’s happiness. Never before in history has every believer been
endowed with God’s power.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;to obtain an inheritance which is imperishable and
undefiled and will not fade away, reserved in heaven for you, who are protected
by the power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the
last time.&quot;  (1 Peter 1:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;seeing that His divine power has granted to us everything
pertaining to life and godliness, through the true knowledge of Him who called
us by His own glory and excellence.&quot;  (2 Peter 1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God’s Power In The Spiritual Life  </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We have the indwelling of God the Father as the assurance
and the guarantee that His power has provided every grace blessing for the
Christian way of life. Everything that we need to grow spiritually and honor
and please Him has been provided by God the Father. He provides everything from
the filling of the Spirit right through to sharing His very own happiness.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are indwelt by God the Son as the guarantee that our
lives will be perpetuated because God the Son meets all of our needs according
to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus. He controls nature, He controls human
history, and this is the guarantee that we’re going to be in this life just as
long as God wants us to be. That’s the power of the Lord Jesus Christ.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The power of God the Holy Spirit fills us. The filling of
the Holy Spirit simply means that God the Holy Spirit has total control over
our soul. This is His power. When we are in fellowship with God, we are
controlled by the Holy Spirit with God’s unlimited enabling power. Col. 1:10-12;
Eph. 3:16; 2 Thess. 1:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;so that you will walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, to
please Him in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in
the knowledge of God; strengthened with all power, according to His glorious
might, for the attaining of all steadfastness and patience; joyously giving
thanks to the Father, who has qualified us to share in the inheritance of the
saints in Light.&quot;  (Colossians 1:10-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;that He would grant you, according to the riches of His
glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inner
man,&quot;  (Ephesians 3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;To this end also we pray for you always, that our God
will count you worthy of your calling, and fulfill every desire for goodness
and the work of faith with power,&quot;  (2 Thessalonians 1:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We have received Christ as Savior and we are protected by
the omnipotence of God. We are protected by God’s power. This is in the perfect
tense in the Greek so that it means protected in the past with the result that
you keep on being protected forever. You can’t lose your salvation. God guards
you, shields you, and is a sentry for what you have in your soul. You are going
to be with him forever and ever whether you like it or not. 1 Peter 1:3-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
who according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living
hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to obtain an
inheritance which is imperishable and undefiled and will not fade away,
reserved in heaven for you, who are protected by the power of God through faith
for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.&quot;  (1 Peter 1:3-5,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some Christians become atheists after they are saved.
That doesn’t mean they have lost their salvation. It does mean that they’re
going to be miserable in this life. Anyone who is an atheist or an agnostic or
anyone who does not give God His proper due in life is going to be very
unhappy.  However, they will always remain saved and they will be happy in
heaven. This is protected by the power of God.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are many ways we as believers can apply the
principle of God’s limitless power to the spiritual life. Some relate to how we
handle problems that come our way. We are to handle them with God’s grace
resources and by applying <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine solutions rather than
our own inadequate abilities. Isaiah 40:29-31; Psalms 27:1; Isaiah 26:4; 2 Tim.
1:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He gives strength to the weary, And to him who lacks
might He increases power. Though youths grow weary and tired, And vigorous
young men stumble badly, Yet those who wait for the LORD Will gain new
strength; They will mount up with wings like eagles, They will run and not get
tired, They will walk and not become weary.&quot;  (Isaiah 40:29-31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i><span style='color:blue'>&quot; A Psalm of David. The
LORD is my light and my salvation; Whom shall I fear? The LORD is the defense
of my life; Whom shall I dread?&quot;  (Psalms 27:1, NASB)</span></i></p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Trust in the LORD forever, For in GOD the LORD, we
have an everlasting Rock.&quot;  (Isaiah 26:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For this reason I also suffer these things, but I am not
ashamed; for I know whom I have believed and I am convinced that He is able to
guard what I have entrusted to Him until that day.&quot;  (2 Timothy 1:12,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Other applications of God’s omnipotence to the spiritual
life involve the teaching ministry of the Holy Spirit, which empowers believers
to live as God intended believers to live. Jer 33:3, Acts 1:7-8, 2 Cor. 9:8;
Eph. 3:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;'Call to Me and I will answer you, and I will tell you
great and mighty things, which you do not know.'&quot;  (Jeremiah 33:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He said to them, &quot;It is not for you to know times or
epochs which the Father has fixed by His own authority; but you will receive
power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be My witnesses
both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and even to the remotest part
of the earth.&quot; &quot;  (Acts 1:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that
always having all sufficiency in everything, you may have an abundance for
every good deed;&quot;  (2 Corinthians 9:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly beyond
all that we ask or think, according to the power that works within us,&quot; 
(Ephesians 3:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Believer’s Use of God’s Power vs. Use of Man’s
Power</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every believer must continuously chose between
application of God’s solutions to their problems and situations or to apply
human solutions. This is the struggle between use of divine power through the
filling of the Holy Spirit or use of our own human abilities without the Holy
Spirit. The greatest flaw that a believer can develop is to substitute human
power, human personality, or human dynamics for divine power. Divine power is
given to us through the intake, belief, and application of Bible doctrine. What
we apply is directly from what is resident in the right lobe of our souls.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In every dispensation, God has a plan, will, and purpose
for all believers. Although God is perfect and His plan is perfect, the
believer is not. After salvation, we are all tempted to sin. 1 John 1:5-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;This is the message we have heard from Him and announce
to you, that God is Light, and in Him there is no darkness at all. If we say
that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do
not practice the truth; but if we walk in the Light as He Himself is in the
Light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son
cleanses us from all sin. If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving
ourselves and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, He is faithful
and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all
unrighteousness. If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar and His
word is not in us.&quot;  (1 John 1:5-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As Church Age believers, we do not have the power or
ability to live God's plan for our lives my our own means. God’s perfect plan
can only be lived by using a perfect power. All believers are given this
perfect power at salvation – the enabling power or omnipotence of God the Holy
Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God’s Power to Live According to His Plan</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The omnipotence of God is made available by living the
spiritual life and the filling of the Holy Spirit. This spiritual life of the
believer grows in depth based on the knowledge of God’s wisdom by the
consistent perception of Bible doctrine. All believers are given at least one
spiritual gift at salvation as part of the 40 things God gives to all believers
at salvation. Eph. 5:17-18. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/S/The%2040%20Things%20Received%20at%20Salvation.html">The
40 Things Received at Salvation</a>. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So then do not be foolish, but understand what the will
of the Lord is. And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but be
filled with the Spirit,&quot;  (Ephesians 5:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The combination of consistent intake and application of
Bible doctrine to our lives leads us to understand the function of our
spiritual gifts. This combination allows us to think divine viewpoint in every
situation and to glorify God in the production of divine good. This is called
walking in the Spirit. The filling of the Spirit and the thinking of Bible
doctrine in the soul is the delegation of divine power. Gal. 5:16-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out
the desire of the flesh. For the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit, and
the Spirit against the flesh; for these are in opposition to one another, so
that you may not do the things that you please.&quot;  (Galatians 5:16-17,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divine power for living according to God’s plan for our
lives is made available through our relationship with the Holy Spirit and our
attitude toward Bible doctrine. The spiritual life is where we are to seek to
live according to God's will and purpose. We can only accomplish this by using
the unlimited power of the Holy Spirit. If we do not, we operate under human
power and ability, which produces nothing acceptable to God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divine power and human power are mutually exclusive.
Spirituality is also an absolute. We are either 100% filled with the Holy
Spirit or we are 100% controlled by our sin nature using some form of human
power and human wisdom. When we use our own human solutions and abilities to
solve our problems in life, we are not filled with the Holy Spirit, but
controlled by our sin nature. Being out of fellowship with the Holy Spirit is
called grieving the Holy Spirit in Ephesians 4:30 and quenching the Holy Spirit
in 1 Thessalonians 5:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were
sealed for the day of redemption.&quot;  (Ephesians 4:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Do not quench the Spirit;&quot;  (1 Thessalonians 5:19,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Christian way of life is only lived by Christians who
live the spiritual life through the filling of the Holy Spirit. Without this
supernatural power, the believer functions under human power, human ability,
and carnality. The believer leaves the spiritual life to sin. The sinning
believer can only recover the filling of the Spirit through confession of all
known sins biblically using 1 John 1:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&quot;  (1 John
1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The omnipotence of God the Father provides the
encouragement for the believer through His grace policy and the provision of grace
blessings for our lives and for eternity. The omnipotence of God the Son
provides the historical environment for the believer to live according to God’s
plan by preserving the universe and perpetuating the human race. The
omnipotence of the Holy Spirit provides the enabling power to live the
spiritual life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Human power and ability are no substitute for divine
power. Human power takes the form of various types of legalism. The legalism of
salvation adds human works to faith alone in Christ alone as the means of
salvation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If you have added anything to believing in Christ such as
making Christ Lord of your life, inviting Christ into your heart, water baptism,
commitment, or human behavioral change, you have not been saved by faith alone
in Christ alone. You are not a believer. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is also the legalism of post-salvation works, such
as keeping the Law, living a good life, charity for others, and tithing. Again,
this approach to living the Christian life is living by using human abilities
and power, not divine power.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Your Authority in Living the Spiritual Life</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Do you have any authority in your spiritual life? God has
declared that He will never coerce your free will at any time. This is your
divinely mandated authority to make your own decisions in life.  However, this
means that you are always responsible for your own decisions – no one else. In
this age of shifting responsibility for people’s poor decisions to others that
had nothing to do with the decision, God always hold us accountable for every
decision we make. No exceptions.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher can only teach Bible doctrine. He does
not have the power to force it on anyone. Whether we learn Bible truth and
fulfill God's plan, purpose, and will for our lives depends on our decision to
use God’s divine power. No matter how great or powerful or brilliant we may be
(human IQ), we must make non-meritorious use of the Holy Spirit’s unlimited
power to learn, accept, and apply the Word of God (spiritual IQ) in our lives. This
is the only way we can fulfill the plan of God. Matt. 22:29.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But Jesus answered and said to them, &quot;You are
mistaken, not understanding the Scriptures nor the power of God. &quot; 
(Matthew 22:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Use of divine power always depends on the believer's
volition and their priorities, motivations, and values in life. Every challenge
in life demands the equivalent power and authority for meeting and overcoming
that challenge. The power for living according to God’s plan resides in the
function of your volition or free will.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every believer must take the full responsibility for their
own decisions after salvation. This is the law of volitional responsibility.
You can either sow to Bible doctrine and reap a magnificent life, or you can
sow to the wind and reap the whirlwind. Hosea 8:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For they sow the wind And they reap the whirlwind. The
standing grain has no heads; It yields no grain. Should it yield, strangers
would swallow it up.” (Hosea 8:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every believer has been given equal privilege and equal
opportunity to live their lives as unto the Lord. This is why only the enabling
power of the Holy Spirit is the means. Your free will is the key as to whether
you will make use of it. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To live according to God’s plan, we are to make the right
decisions for Bible doctrine, especially under the conditions of life’s
pressures and distractions. It also demands the faithful function of the
pastor-teacher to accurately teach Bible doctrine.</p>
