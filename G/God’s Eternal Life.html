<h2><a name="_D-God’s_Foreknowledge"></a><a name="_D-God’s_Eternal_Life"></a>God’s
Eternal Life</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God existed in eternity past and He will exist forever.
God had no beginning and will have no end. He is eternal life and has always
existed. God is not subject to time. He invented time and has always existed
apart from time. We as believers in Jesus Christ as our personal Savior have
been given everlasting life from God at the moment of salvation. 1 John 5:11-12;
John 10:28-29. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And the testimony is this, that God has given us eternal life,
and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has the life; he who does not
have the Son of God does not have the life.” (1 John 5:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and I give eternal life to them, and they will never perish;
and no one will snatch them out of My hand. &quot;My Father, who has given them
to Me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of the
Father's hand.” (John 10:28-29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This means that we had a beginning, but we are given
everlasting life permanently at salvation and will be with Jesus Christ
forever. God had no beginning and will have no end. Therefore, God is the only
being to possess eternal life. But He is more than that, He is eternal life. John
3:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For God so loved the world, that He gave His only
begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal
life.” (John 3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is spirit. God is perfect self-existence and is
absolutely self-sustaining and independent from any other being. He is absolute
existence. God exists eternally unsustained either by Himself or by any other
source. God is the cause of all existence outside of Himself, but there is no
cause for Himself.  John 4:24; John 8:58; Gen. 1:1; Isaiah 43:13; Col. 1:17;
Job 36:26; John 1:1-5, Rev. 1:8. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in
spirit and truth.&quot;” (John 4:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Jesus said to them, &quot;Truly, truly, I say to you, before
Abraham was born, I am.&quot;” (John 8:58, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.”
(Genesis 1:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Even from eternity I am He, And there is none who can
deliver out of My hand; I act and who can reverse it?&quot;” (Isaiah 43:13,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together.”
(Colossians 1:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Behold, God is exalted, and we do not know Him; The
number of His years is unsearchable.” (Job 36:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and
the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came into being
through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being that has come into
being. In Him was life, and the life was the Light of men. The Light shines in
the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.” (John 1:1-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I am the Alpha and the Omega,&quot; says the Lord God,
&quot;who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.&quot;” (Revelation
1:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God Is Spirit</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is not made up of matter as we are. He is invisible
yet possesses real life. God is not only eternal life, but He is spirit. John
4:24.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in
spirit and truth.&quot;” (John 4:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>No one can receive spiritual life until they believe in
Christ. We are given everlasting life at the moment of salvation and we develop
our spiritual life through the consistent learning and applying of Bible
doctrine to our lives. Our spiritual life depends on how consistently we follow
God’s mandates for us to learn Bible doctrine and by applying it to our lives,
we grow in grace and knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Relationship of God’s Eternal Life To Time</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The eternal life of God means that God has always
existed. God is the cause of time. Deut. 32:40; Psalms 90:2; Psalms 102:27; Eph.
1:4. </p>

<p class=Verses>“'Indeed, I lift up My hand to heaven, And say, as I live
forever,” (Deuteronomy 32:40, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Before the mountains were born Or You gave birth to the earth
and the world, Even from everlasting to everlasting, You are God.” (Psalms
90:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But You are the same, And Your years will not come to an
end.” (Psalms 102:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world,
that we would be holy and blameless before Him. In love” (Ephesians 1:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Before God invented time, He always existed. Billions of
years before He created the angels and mankind, He eternally existed. This
attribute of God is difficult for mankind to grasp as we have finite frames of
reference and finite minds. How do we measure the immeasurable? Time was
designed by God in eternity past for man’s convenience and so we could orient
to our life in the simplest possible way. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is not in time, but time is in God and subject to
God. God created the universe on which time and space are constructed. God
transcends all creation. Although without substance, both time and space are
objects of God's creation. Time is finite and has duration. It began at a point
of God’s choosing and will end at a point of God’s choosing. In contrast,
eternity, which is infinite, has duration only. The difficulty with human
frames of reference is that we cannot fully understand the infinite. Therefore,
we have trouble fully understanding the concept or eternal life because all
that we see or understand apart from God is finite.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Imputation of God’s Eternal Life to the Believer</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has always lived. Jer. 10:10; 1 Thess. 1:9.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“But the LORD is the true God; He is the living God and the
everlasting King. At His wrath the earth quakes, And the nations cannot endure
His indignation.” (Jeremiah 10:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For they themselves report about us what kind of a reception
we had with you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve a living and
true God,” (1 Thessalonians 1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God does not merely possess life. God is life. Each
member of the Trinity has eternal life, infinite life, and spiritual life. God
imputes His very own eternal life to the believer through Jesus Christ as the
only Savior. John 6:47; 1 John 5:11-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes has eternal
life.” (John 6:47, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the testimony is this, that God has given us eternal life,
and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has the life; he who does not
have the Son of God does not have the life. These things I have written to you
who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have
eternal life.” (1 John 5:11-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The imputation of eternal life is one of the 40 things
that God does for every Church Age believer at the moment of faith in Jesus
Christ. The Holy Spirit creates in us a human spirit (Regeneration) as the
target for the imputation of God’s perfect eternal life. When we are physical
born, the life we possess is human life or soul life. This human life or soul
life is imputed to us from God the Father at birth when we take our first
breath. Eternal life is given to us when we are spiritually born again - the
new birth. This is why we must be born again.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The unbeliever does not have the life of God. The
unbeliever has only soul life created by God and given to every member of the
human race at birth. Soul life means the human soul will live forever. The
issue is where the soul will reside forever – in heaven with God or in the lake
of fire apart from God. John 3:36. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who
does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on
him.&quot;” (John 3:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To receive the eternal life of God, you must believe in
the substitutionary spiritual death of the Lord Jesus Christ on the Cross for
the sins of all mankind. This in the only path to everlasting life.</p>
