<h2>Grace Resources for Learning Bible Doctrine</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s grace has provided human volition that must
willingly chose to accept the teaching of Bible doctrine and then willingly
believe that Bible doctrine whereby the Holy Spirit transfers the understood
spiritual knowledge (<i>gnosis</i>) from the left lobe to the right lobe of the
soul as believed spiritual knowledge (<i>epignosis</i>). God’s grace has
provided His plan for the human race and for each believer individually. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s grace has provided the written divinely-inspired
Word of God, the Canon of Scripture for the believer’s understanding of who God
is and what His plan is for their lives. No one earned or deserved the 66 books
of the Word of God. 1 Cor. 2:16; John 5:39; Heb. 4:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT
HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.” (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>““You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you
have eternal life; it is these that testify about Me;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 5:39,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any
two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of
both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the
heart.” (Hebrews 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>God’s grace has provided the omnipotence
of God the Holy Spirit inside the spiritual life enabling us to understand and
apply Bible doctrine and fulfill God's plan for our life. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>God’s grace has authorized the
local church for the authoritative teaching of Bible doctrine in public
assembly. Worship is academic, not emotional. God always raises up local
churches where pastors are faithful in the teaching of the Word of God. You
must know who God is and His plan to grow spiritually and to fulfill His plan
for your life. 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, Titus.</p>

<p class=Verses>“for which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle and a
teacher.” (2 Timothy 1:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“but at the proper time manifested, even His word, in the
proclamation with which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God our
Savior,” (Titus 1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>God’s grace has provided the spiritual
gift of pastor-teacher as a communicator of Bible doctrine to the congregation of
believers. This communication is strictly a monologue, not a dialogue. God’s
grace has provided a pastor-teacher for every believer who is positive to the
teaching of Bible doctrine. There is no such thing as a self-made Christian.
You must learn Bible doctrine from someone else with the gift of pastor-teacher.
Eph. 4:11-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some
as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the
saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ; until
we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of
God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the
fullness of Christ.” (Ephesians 4:11-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s grace has provided the royal priesthood of the
believer in the Church Age for privacy of reception and application of Bible
doctrine. The purpose of having a public assembly for the teaching of Bible
doctrine is to be able to privately in your own soul either accept or reject
what is taught. 1 Peter 2:5; 1 Peter 2:9; Rev. 1:5-6. </p>

<p class=Verses>“you also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual
house for a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
through Jesus Christ.” (1 Peter 2:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But you are A CHOSEN RACE, A royal PRIESTHOOD, A HOLY NATION,
A PEOPLE FOR God's OWN POSSESSION, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of
Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;” (1 Peter 2:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of
the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To Him who loves us and
released us from our sins by His blood— and He has made us to be a kingdom,
priests to His God and Father—to Him be the glory and the dominion forever and
ever. Amen.” (Revelation 1:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s grace has provided the universal indwelling of the
Holy Spirit for all Church Age believers. The Holy Spirit is our teacher of
Bible doctrine and source of divine power to live the spiritual life. 1 Cor.
2:9-16; 1 John 2:27; John 16:13; 1 Cor. 6:19-20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“As for you, the anointing which you received from Him abides
in you, and you have no need for anyone to teach you; but as His anointing
teaches you about all things, and is true and is not a lie, and just as it has
taught you, you abide in Him.” (1 John 2:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide
you into all the truth; for He will not speak on His own initiative, but
whatever He hears, He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come.”
(John 16:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy
Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and that you are not your own?
For you have been bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body.” (1
Corinthians 6:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>God’s grace has provided the
confession of sin to God the Father as the only means of recovering the filling
of the Holy Spirit. This is a grace procedure, confess quietly, privately. You
are not required to be sorry, to agonize. 1 John 1:9; Eph. 3:19; Eph. 4:10;Eph.
5:14-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that
you may be filled up to all the fullness of God.” (Ephesians 3:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He who descended is Himself also He who ascended far above all
the heavens, so that He might fill all things.)” (Ephesians 4:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>God’s grace has provided a human
spirit at salvation which is the target for doctrinal teaching from the Holy
Spirit. 1 Cor. 2:12; Job 32:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the
Spirit who is from God, so that we may know the things freely given to us by
God,” (1 Corinthians 2:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But it is a spirit in man, And the breath of the
Almighty gives them understanding.” (Job 32:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s grace has provided the left lobe of the soul (<i>nous</i>),
the perceptive lobe, the mind where comprehended spiritual knowledge is stored
as <i>gnosis</i>. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s grace has provided the right lobe of the soul, the
heart, where believed spiritual knowledge (<i>epignosis</i>) is transferred by
the Holy Spirit from the left lobe and stored in the edification complex of the
soul.  2 Peter 3:18; Rom. 12:2; Heb. 4:12; Rom. 8:16; Eph. 3:16-18; 1 Cor.
2:1-6; James 1:18-25; Eph. 4:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory, both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.”
(2 Peter 3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by
the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that
which is good and acceptable and perfect.” (Romans 12:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any
two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of
both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the
heart.” (Hebrews 4:12, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are
children of God,” (Romans 8:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory,
to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inner man, so that
Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; and that you, being rooted and
grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the
breadth and length and height and depth,” (Ephesians 3:16-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind,”
(Ephesians 4:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s grace has provided grace resources whereby every
Church Age believer is supported in this life to fulfill God’s plan for their
life. This includes transportation, clothes, food, shelter, and other
necessities of life. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s grace has provided spiritual freedom that exists
only within the believer’s spiritual life. Gal. 5:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“It was for freedom that Christ set us free; therefore keep
standing firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery.” (Galatians
5:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s grace has provided human freedom for the entire
human race through the laws of divine establishment.  John 8:32.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you
free.&quot;” (John 8:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><a name="_Spiritual_IQ"></a>God's grace has provided a spiritual
IQ that is due to the enabling power of the Holy Spirit in the perception and
application of Bible doctrine. In learning and applying Bible doctrine, you
must distinguish between human IQ (mental age divided by chronological age) and
spiritual IQ. Spiritual IQ is the grace function of the Holy Spirit to enable
the believer to understand Bible doctrine being communicated to them. See
category on <a href="#_D-Spiritual_IQ">Spiritual IQ</a>.</p>
