<h2>God’s Personality</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>A person is defined as having
two essential elements - self-consciousness and self-determination. To have
self-consciousness, one must first be aware of their own existence. Once that
is understood, then one can demonstrate self-determination by making decisions
in relationship to that awareness. All members of the human race are persons
because they all possess these two essential elements to a limited degree. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>God is a person because He
possesses the same essential elements of personality – the same
self-consciousness and self-determination, but to an infinite and perfect
degree. His divine personality is perfect, absolute, and eternal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>When God was talking to Moses
in Exodus 3:14, He indicated His self-consciousness. God illustrates His self-determination
through His will and divine plan for mankind. God’s plan for mankind reflects
all of His perfect and absolute attributes. God is above all because He created
all that exists apart from Himself.  Eph. 1:9; Eph. 1:11.</span></p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;God said to Moses, &quot;I AM WHO I AM&quot;; and He
said, &quot;Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, 'I AM has sent me to
you.'&quot;&quot;  (Exodus 3:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He made known to us the mystery of His will, according to
His kind intention which He purposed in Him&quot;  (Ephesians 1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;also we have obtained an inheritance, having been
predestined according to His purpose who works all things after the counsel of
His will,&quot;  (Ephesians 1:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b><span style='color:black'>Relating Human Personality Attributes
to God’s Attributes</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>Adam was created with a body, soul
and human spirit, but no old sin nature. The rest of us are born with an old
sin nature, but no human spirit. We all have invisible attributes in our soul.
From these invisible attributes in the soul come our personality with self-consciousness,
mentality, volition, emotion, etc. Personality is the manifestation of how
things function in the soul.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>God’s personality is related to
His other perfect attributes. God has always been aware of His unique and
infinite attributes. He knows Himself to be beyond any comparison with any of
His creation. God is the cause of all existence outside of Himself. Gen. 1:1. </span></p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;In the beginning God created the heavens and the
earth.&quot;  (Genesis 1:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>He has always known He is
infinite and without boundary or limitation. God exists eternally, not sustained
by Himself or any other source. He has always known that those perfect
attributes are unique and belong to His life and to His person. Therefore, to
an absolute degree, God is the ultimate in personality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>Knowledge is always a part of
the personality of anyone. Because God has always known all the knowable, His
knowledge is absolute and is a part of His personality. This omniscience
supports His perfect confidence and faithfulness in His grace plan for mankind.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>The sovereignty of God is
related to His personality just as with people where the decisions you make establish
your personality. God’s decisions made in eternity past as part of the Divine
Decrees establish His personality. All of God's decisions were made in eternity
past, therefore His personality is immutable. Isaiah 44:6; 1 Tim. 1:17.</span></p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Thus says the LORD, the King of Israel and his
Redeemer, the LORD of hosts: 'I am the first and I am the last, And there is no
God besides Me.&quot;  (Isaiah 44:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only
God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.&quot;  (1 Timothy 1:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>Self-consciousness and volition
are important aspects of your personality. Self-consciousness and volition are
a part of man’s personality because man’s soul was created in God's own image.
God recognizes Himself as a person. God has always been conscious of Himself. As
such He functions with perfect integrity and perfect rationality. Personality
should have integrity and rationality. Rationality means you think and
integrity means you apply what you think. Therefore, God is infinite
personality. Isaiah 45:5-6.</span></p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;I am the LORD, and there is no other; Besides Me
there is no God. I will gird you, though you have not known Me; That men may
know from the rising to the setting of the sun That there is no one besides Me.
I am the LORD, and there is no other,&quot;  (Isaiah 45:5-6, NASB)</p>
