<h2>Components of the Hebrew Language</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The content and subject matter of this Hebrew Language is
taken from the rough teaching notes of the instructor of a beginning Hebrew
class. The greatest benefit that these can be to someone not in the class is to
use them with a Hebrew grammar, to guide you in your study of the Hebrew
language. Due to the nature of these factors, much explanation will be missing.
The reader should take this into consideration in using this material. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Parts of Speech of the Hebrew Language</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Verbs: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i><u>Tense</u></i>: means quality of action in the
Hebrew. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Perfect tense</i>: completed action. Time is indicated
by the context. It has many variations of usages. An advanced grammar will
clarify all the usages of the perfect tense. The simple narration of past
events, even in relating repeating actions. Corresponds to the Greek aorist. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To represent actions, events, or states, which were
terminated in the past and finally concluded. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To represent actions which were already completed in the
past at the time when other actions or conditions took place. This is the
pluperfect concept. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To represent actions, events, or states, which, although
completed in the past, nevertheless extend their influence into the present. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To represent in a direct narration, reactions which,
although really only in process of accomplishment, are meant to be represented
as already accomplished in the mind of the writer. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To represent facts which have formerly taken place, and
are still of constant recurrence, and therefore matters of common experience. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To represent future actions, when the speaker intends by
an express assurance to represent them as finished, or accomplished facts. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To express facts that are undoubtedly imminent, and
therefore, in the imagination and mind of the writer, they are already
accomplished. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To express actions or facts which are meant to be
indicated as existing in the future in a completed state. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To express actions and facts, whose accomplishment in the
past is to be represented not as actual, but only as possible. This is the
imperfect idea in Latin. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Imperfect tense</i>: incomplete action. Time is
indicated by the context. Also has many variations. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The imperfect tense represents actions, events, or states
which are regarded by the speaker at any moment as still continuing, or in
process of accomplishment or even as just taking place. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Conceived in the mind of the speaker, or simply desired
by the speaker. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The imperfect tense used with past time in context:
Expresses actions which continued throughout a longer or shorter period.
Expresses actions which were repeated in the past, either at fixed intervals or
occasionally. Job 1:5 “Thus did sob continually.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The imperfect tense in the present time: Expresses
actions which continued throughout a longer or shorter period. Expresses
actions which were repeated in the past, either at fixed intervals or
occasionally. To express actions which although, strictly speaking, are already
finished, are regarded as still lasting on into the present time, or continuing
to operate in the present time.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The imperfect tense and future time: Actions seen as
future from the standpoint of the speaker’s present time. Represent actions
which from some point of time in the past are to be represented as future. To
represent actions, yet future, that are “willed, or not willed,” therefore,
conditional, and only contingent. This could be a simple desire, an imperative,
a definite expectation that something will not happen. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To represent actions, yet future, as possibly taking
place or not taking place. Maybe it will, maybe it won’t. Actions referred to
in a permissive sense: Gen. 2:16 “Of every tree in the garden, thou mayest
freely eat.” This is a permissive imperfect. In negative sentences to express
actions which cannot or should not happen. In conditional clauses “yea, though
I walk, or might walk.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i><u>Stem</u></i>: this indicates two things - first,
how the subject is related to the action of the verb or action word, and
secondly, the specific nature of the action as to degree; simple, intensive, or
causative. Using the verb “to kill,” the following Hebrew stems are standard.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Qal stem: Active voice, indicative mood, Declarative:
“kills.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Niphil stem: Passive voice and reflexive, declarative:
“was killed.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Piel stem: Intensive, active: “he kills violently.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Pual stem: Intensive, passive: “was killed violently.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Hithpael stem: Intensive reflexive middle (like the
Greek) declarative: “suicide” or “he killed himself.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Hiphil stem: Intensive, causative, active: “to cause to
kill.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Hophal stem: Intensive, causative, passive: “caused to be
killed.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i><u>Conjugations</u></i>: Strong: root having three
radicals none of which are gutterals or “n.” Weak: with three basic varieties
and many other small categories.  Stative verb conjugations. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i><u>Identification</u></i>: By prefix, by radicals, by
vowel pattern, by suffix, and by pronominal suffix. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i><u>Characteristics</u></i>: A verb will have tense
characteristics. The imperfect has the prefix in the strong verb. A verb will
have stem characteristics which identify a certain stem. A verb may have
conjugation characteristics. A verb will have suffix characteristics.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Nouns:</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are four main classes of nouns and also other
groupings with special types. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The noun has two basic functions called “states.” The
absolute state and the construct state which is the genitive idea, “of” such as
“the man of.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As to gender: it is masculine or feminine. No neuter in
Hebrew. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As to number: it is singular, plural, or dual. Dual is
the concept of the “pair.” It is not used for the ordinary idea of two things,
unless they are like, two eyes, etc. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Declining a noun requires the identification of the
suffix endings to determine the person, gender, and number as well as the
absolute or construct state of the noun. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Vowel pattern in nouns as well as verbs is altered by the
addition of suffixes. This is usually a vowel reduction.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The position: the construct occurs first in word order,
and the absolute follows.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The definiteness: for either the absolute or construct
noun, the definiteness depends on the definite article used with the absolute,
or the noun being of such nature that it is definite without the article, such
as proper names.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Infinitive: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Definition</i>: it is a verbal noun, noun of action. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>State</i>: it is either absolute or construct. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Function</i>: strengthen the verb or indicate purpose.
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>As to form</i>: in all the stems of the strong verb
except the niphil, it has only two forms per stem. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>As to limitations</i>: the absolute can have nothing
prefixed or added to it. The construct cannot stand alone in a sentence but
must be a part of an absolute construct relationship. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The infinitive as a part of the Hebrew sentence: </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>It is a verbal
noun. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>It has two
forms: <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>קְטֹל</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>and <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>יִקְטֹל</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>   </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>It has two
functions: Absolute and Construct. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>The Absolute
and the Construct Infinitive have specifics related to each of them. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>The infinitive
is timeless, it may express past, present, or future concepts.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>The infinitive
may function as a noun or as a verb. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The infinitive absolute; verbal substantive: </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As to form: absolute and construct. In all the stems of
the strong verb, the infinitive has only two forms except in the Niphil. This
is true for Greek as there is only one form for the Greek infinitive per tense,
so there is one form for Absolute and one for Construct per stem.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As to function: The Infinitive Absolute normally serves
to strengthen the verb. It may stand independently as a finite verb and take an
object.  It may be used as the object of a finite verb: “I love eating.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When used with a verb of the same root, it occurs before
the verb to strengthen it. It precedes to strengthen and follows to show
continuation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When used with a verb of a different root it is used to
define the verbal idea more clearly. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It may be used as the subject or predicate nominative of
a sentence. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Its limitations: Nothing can be prefixed or added. It
stands alone, and throws up the bare idea of the verb. It usually is
accompanied by a finite verb. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The infinitive construct: </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As to function: It may serve as the subject of a
sentence, the object of a verb, or the object of a preposition, commonly the
preposition “to.” The killing of the man was hidden. (subject). He went to kill
the bear. (object of verb).  I went to the killing of the criminals (object of
preposition). It may appear as the first member of a construct relation. To
kill the man. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Prepositions: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Purpose of the

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Participle:</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The participle is a verbal adjective and descriptive in
nature. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The participle has a voice concept: active or passive.
The one killing or killed.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The participle is timeless, may refer to the present,
past or future time. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>With the exception of the qal participle, the other stem
participles have a prefix <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>מ</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The participle may take an object. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The participle in its distinctiveness: </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>The participle
emphasizes an action or condition in unbroken continuity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>The participle
emphasizes continuity, the imperfect emphasizes succession. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>The participle
is a line ________ and the imperfect is a succession of points .......... </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>The participle
in general would emphasize the continuity of action while the infinitive would
emphasize the purpose in the action or the action as a purpose. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The participle as to form: it has two. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Active:  <span

dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span>  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The qal stem is the only one having the active and
passive. In all stems but the qal, the participle is active, only. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The verb tense indicates quality of action. The
infinitive emphasizes the purpose in the action. The participles emphasize the
continuity of the action.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Imperative: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Function: it is a positive command and cannot be used
with negative commands. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Form: based on the forms of the imperfect and omitting
the prefix.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Hebrew Sentences: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The nominal sentence: both subject and predicate are
substantives, usually connected by copula or implied copula. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The verbal sentence: subject is a noun or pronoun and
predicate is a finite verb. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The compound sentence: sentence in which either the
subject or predicate is a complete clause in itself. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The incomplete sentence: Incomplete sentences are those
where either the subject or the predicate or both, have to be supplied by the
context. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The exclamation sentence: Sentences introduced by  <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>מָה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span>  are often exclamations of wonder or indignation or ridicule or
astonishment. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The interrogative sentence: As a rule the simple question
is introduced by the interrogative  <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>הֲ</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> . </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The promise or threat sentence: Often introduced by  <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>אִם</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>  </span>to indicate certainly or certainly not. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The desiderative sentence: A sentence expressing a wish
by use of the simple imperfect, cohortative, jussive, imperative, perfect
consecutive or by simple noun clause. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The negative sentence: Independent sentences made
negative by the use of adverbs, conjunctions, particles, certain suffixes, etc.
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sentences connected by Waw: Thus two sentences are joined
together that form a syntactical unit. Possibly in a coordinating way, possibly
the antithesis, or circumstantial relationship, or casual significance. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Conditional sentences: Sentences usually of two
varieties. Conditional sentences which are capable of fulfillment, and those
incapable of fulfillment. They appear in two basic ways: with and without an
introductory particle. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Conditional sentences capable of fulfillment: The
fundamental rule is that this type of sentence is expressed by the imperfect
with its equivalents, the jussive, cohortative, imperative, perfect consecutive
and participle. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Conditional sentences incapable of fulfillment: The
fundamental rule is that this type of sentence is expressed by the introduction
with  <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>לוּ</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>  </span>followed by the
perfect.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Hebrew Constructions:</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrew as well as Greek, individual words are used in
sentences within the framework of constructions. Some of these constructions
are grammatical, some relate to word order, or position, others relate to
constructions with emphasis on the components of that construction. The
following are some of the basic constructions that may occur in the Hebrew
text.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The adjective and noun construction: (attributive or
predicate). Each construction usually has a word order or position of words
within that construction which must be noticed. It has certain components. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The absolute-construct relationship: Construction of
nouns, infinitives, adjectives, etc. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Infinitive and verb constructions: Position is important,
infinitive before the verb or after it. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Nominal sentence construction: Components more of a
factor than word position. Here the subject and predicate are both
substantives. Noun or noun equivalents such as participles. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Verbal sentence construction: Position of the verb and
the subject of the sentence is the issue here.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Waw consecutive structure: This is a narrative sentence
structure. If this is ignored one could arrive at strange conclusions about the
text. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Demonstrative pronoun constructions: This is important as
to the position and word order of the pronoun and the word it is related to.
Attributive or predicate. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Pronominal suffix constructions: position and nature of
that to which it is attached. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Compound sentence construction: Primary subject, as a
clause, occurring first, sometimes appearing as floating in the air but,
however, not. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Negative sentence construction: Important factor in this
construction is the choice of the negative particle doing the negating. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paragraph construction - sentences connected by waw: </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Relative clause construction: </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Circumstantial clause construction: </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Conditional sentence construction: </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Comparative clause construction:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Construction related to particles: position, use and
attachment within sentences.</p>
