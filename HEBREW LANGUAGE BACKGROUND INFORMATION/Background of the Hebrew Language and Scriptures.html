<h2>Background of the Hebrew Language and Scriptures</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Hebrew Language</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Hebrew language itself: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Biblical designations: It is called the “language of
Canaan.” Isaiah 19:18. It is called the “Jews’ language.” 2 Kings 18:26, Neh.
13:24. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Characteristics: As to sounds, consonants carry emphasis
over the vowels. As to roots, it is characterized by three letters to the root
(consonants). As to style, it is simple, poetic, and pictorial.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The family origin of the Hebrew language: from the
Semitic language family. </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Babylonian-Assyrian: </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Oldest known Semitic language - cuneiform type.  This was
adopted by the Semitic Babylonians in about 4,000 BC. It was simplified by the
Assyrians in 1500 BC. It was sometimes called Babylonian, other times Assyrian.
It was used by the Hittite empire from 2,000 to 800 BC. By 1,000 BC, Arameans
used alphabetic writing and pen and ink. Indo-European Medes invaded in 700 BC
and devised an alphabet of 38 letters. Persians in 500 BC used an alphabet of
signs. Influence reached through Palestine and into Egypt for over 3,000 years
with this Babylonian-Assyrian Semitic language. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Aramaic:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is derived from “Aram,” one of the five sons of Shem.
Gen. 10:22.  When “Aram” is translated it is rendered “Syria.”  It is referred
to in 2 Kings 18:26 as “Syrian.”  Ezra 4:7; Isaiah 36:11; Dan. 2:4. Aramaic was
the language of Syria. Aramaic was the language of Mesopotamia (Padan-Aram) in
Laban’s time. Gen. 31:47. Abraham’s country. Gen. 24:4,10; Gen. 28:2,5. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It spread east into Assyria and south into Babylonia. It
became the popular commercial language. Daniel and Ezra knew it. It spread
throughout western Syria and Palestine and into parts of Arabia and Egypt and
even into Asia Minor. The Hebrew leaders knew it in Hezekiah’s time. 2 Kings
18:26. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jeremiah used it in Jer. 10:11. Daniel used it in Dan.
2:4 - Dan. 7:28. Ezra used it in quoting Gentile correspondence in Ezra 4:8 -
Ezra 6:18 and Ezra 7:12-26. By the 1st Century BC, Aramaic had become the
common language of the Jews and continued during the time of Christ. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Hebrew: </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The alphabet has 22 consonants with square
Assyrian-Hebrew script (later Aramaic). The Hebrew alphabet originated from the
Old Phoenician alphabet from which all eventually came, Semitic and
non-Semitic. The roundness of the Hebrew letters is a modification of Aramaic
characters. Vowel points in modern Hebrew were added in 600-800 AD by Masoretic
scholars, at Tiberias in Palestine. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Its geographical orientation: “The Canaanite origin of
Hebrew is attested by Ugaritic and Phoenician,” quotes Dr. Unger. Hebrew is
closely aligned with a Canaanite dialect. There were 11 tribes of the
Canaanites, one of which became the most noted, the Phoenicians. They were
Hamitic, but became Semitic in language.  Hebrew was called “the language of
Canaan” in Isaiah 19:18.  Palestine (Canaan) is the native place of Hebrew.
Some think Abraham brought Hebrew into Canaan. Others say that it is an
adaption of his language with a dialect of Canaan. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The origin of the term “Hebrew” and its use as a title
for language. “Hebrew” as a language designation takes its name from the Hebrew
people in the Old Testament who used it. Gen. 14:13; Gen. 40:15; Gen. 41:12. The
term “Hebrew” may come from an ancestor of Abraham, Eber, a Semitic progenitor.
Gen. 10:21-22; Gen. 10:25; Gen. 11:15-16. This is quite probable. The root idea
of the term means to cross over or the cross-over man. It was first called
Hebrew in the prologue of Ecclesiasticus in 130 BC. The term Hebrew in the New
Testament refers to Aramaic. John 5:2; John 19:13; John 19:17; John 19:20; Acts
21:40; Acts 22:2; Acts 26:14. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The time orientation of the Hebrew language:  It was
already spoken and written by 1440 BC when Moses and the Israelites came out of
Egypt (Dr. Unger).  Early Hebrew goes back to the time of Abraham. The Gezer
Calendar, in 925 BC, was written in perfect classical Hebrew.  Old Hebrew was
practically the same as Phoenician. There were two types of Script: Old Hebrew
or Phoenician script and New Hebrew or Aramaic script. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Influences on the Hebrew language: Phoenician script:
mainly the alphabet - pronged type.  Aramaic script: square (roundness) script.
Aramaic script had replaced the Phoenician script and influenced the Hebrew to
the square letters. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Arabic: </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Southern branch, language of northern Arabia.  The best
preservation of the original Semitic forms. It is rich, simple, and flexible.
It gives much insight into sounds, grammatical forms and etymology. It is the
language of the Koran and one of the principle languages of the world. By the
10-11th Century AD, it had virtually replaced Aramaic in Palestine. It is the
only living representative of the Semitic family still used.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Formation of the Old Testament Canon: Only the correct
view is given. </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Old Testament books were written as being held sacred
and divinely authoritative. Inspiration is the basis of canonicity. The
prophets were conscious that they were giving the Word of God. There are
Scriptures too numerous to mention. The prophets had an established reputation
as a prophet of God, office of a prophet and gift of a prophet. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Books were not made canonical by reason of being in a
collection. They were collected because they were canonical. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The real basis for the three section division of the
Hebrew text lies in the official position and/or status of the individual
writer.  Section one: the law from the lawgiver, Moses.  Section two: the
prophets authored by those having both the office of prophet and the gift of
prophet.  Section three: the writings authored by those having the prophetic
gift, but not the office of prophet. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The three steps or facets requisite to canonicity: Divine
inspiration recognized in each book as it was written.  Human recognition by
providential guidance under inspiration principles. Eventual collection into a
canon.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Subdivisions of the text: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Division into words: Isaiah Scrolls of 125-100 BC contain
word divisions.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Division into verse: indicated in Mishnah, about 200 AD. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Soph Pasuq: the period - mentioned only after 500 AD.
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Textual divisions: Parashah, also liturgical divisions: The
law section was divided into 54 large portions called “parachah.” These
sections were read every sabbath and enabled reading the Law once a year. The “parachah”
were divided into 669 smaller sections. In Palestine, they divided the Law into
154 sections called S’dharim, to be read in three years. In the Maccabean
times, the prophets were also divided into 54 sections called the “haphtarahs.”
Chapter divisions as we know them were first noted in the Hebrew Bible (margin)
in 1330 AD and first printed in 1571 AD. Arias Montanus was the first to break
up the text into chapters. Verse divisions in the printed texts were made in
1547 by numbering every fifth verse.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Diacritical marks in the text: 135-500 AD </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Heavy dot over a word or letter: indicated a word or
passage in which a problem existed in the opinion of ancient scholars. Paseq or
divider: vertical mark between two Hebrew words, occurring about 480 times.
Meaning has become obscure in the passage of time. The inverted nun: the Hebrew
nun is written upside down. Num. 10:34-36. The reason is not known. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Peculiar writing of certain letters:  Raised letter:
denotes a variant meaning. Judges 18:30. Enlarged letter: indicating the
beginning of a book middle of the Pentateuch or famous passage. Gen. 1:1. Small
letters: Gen. 2:4. Broken letters: Num. 25:12.  Closed letters: Exodus 32:25. Final
letters used in the middle: Is. 9:6. Non-final letters used at the end: Neh.
2:13. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A blank space sometimes to note an omission.  Removal of
so-called obscenities where indelicate words were substituted with euphemistic
equivalents. Deut. 28:27; 1 Sam. 5:6; 1 Sam. 5:9; 1 Sam. 5:12; 2 Kings 18:27;
Isaiah 36:12.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Other factors concerning the text will be noted in entire
sections devoted to that phase of textual information. These will be further
developed: Manuscripts, transmission, translations, and versions. Writers of
the text.  Chronological developments relating to the text.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Pentateuch: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Its five-fold division: Philo and Josephus attest to the
five-fold division in the 1st Century BC.  The five-fold division exists in the
Septuagint back to the 3rd Century BC. The meaning of Pentateuch comes from two
Greek words, pente and teuchos. Pente means five and teuchos means a tool or
implement. The latter was used later for a sheath or case such as used in carry
the five books or scrolls. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Its designation throughout the Scriptures:  “The Law.”
Josh. 1:7. “The book of the Law.” Josh 8:34. “The book of the law of Moses.”
Josh. 8:31. “The book of the law of God.” Josh 24:26. “The law of Moses.” 1
Kings. 2:3. “The book of the law of the Lord.” 2 Chron. 17:9. “The book of the
law: Gal. 3:10. “The law.” Matt. 5:17; Luke 10:26. “The law of the Lord.” Luke
2:23. “The law of Moses.” Luke 2:22. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The structure of the Pentateuch: </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Genesis was built around a ten-fold genealogical

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Manuscripts and Transmission of the Text:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Two Classes: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Synagogues rolls: three rolls. Pentateuch, Prophets, and Megilloth
with five rolls - Song of Solomon, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, and Esther.
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Private copies.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Rules for preparing the Old Testament manuscripts:
taken from Talmud</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Parchment must be of the skin of a clean animal. Each
column must be at least 48 lines and no more than 60 lines. Pages must be lined
first before copying takes place. Ink must be black. No word or letter could be
written from memory. Scribe had to have authentic copy before him at all times.
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scribe had to pronounce the word before writing it.
Scribe had to wipe the pen before writing the word for God each time. Scribe
had to take a bath each time before writing the word “Jehovah.” Any revision
had to be made within 30 days from writing. One mistake per sheet condemned the
sheet. Three mistakes on a page ruled out the entire manuscript. Every word and
