<h2>Syntax of the Hebrew Verb Forms</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Perfect Tense: </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Basically, the
perfect tense has the idea of completed action. There is no concept of time
except as indicated by the immediate context. The perfect tense should actually
be divided into two kinds of action, perfective and aoristic.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Aoristic Action: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Simple or Definite Past: </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Like the simple
perfect in English, it looks at an action as a past action. Ruth 1:14 “but Ruth
remained with her.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>When the action
is a recent event in the past, the English auxiliary word “has” or “have” is
used. Ruth 1:15 “Your sister-in-law has returned.” Gen. 4:10 “And he said, ‘What
have you done.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Indefinite Past: </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>This points to
some undefined time in the past. Also uses the English “has” and “have.” I Sam.
12:3 “Whose ox have I taken?” Ruth 1:13. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Often there is
a unique quality to this undefined action. The English will add the words “ever”
or “never.” Isaiah 66:8 “Who has ever heard such a thing.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Gnomic Perfect: To express facts which have formerly
taken place, and are still of constant recurrence and, therefore, are events of
common experience. (Cf. the Greek Gnomic Aorist.) The English present tense
best expresses this usage. Psalms 9:11 “For you, Lord, do not forsake them that
seek you.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Present Perfect or Characteristic Perfect: This
represents actions, events or states, though completed in the past, that extend
their influence into the present, in English, sometimes “have” or “has,” and
sometimes the use of the present tense. Psalms 143:6 “I have spread forth my
hands (and still keep them spread forth) or I spread forth my hands,” Psalms
2:1 “Why do the heathen rage?”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Instantaneous Perfect: To indicate an action in the
process of completion but viewed as accomplished at the instant of speaking or
doing. Deut. 18:19 “I testify,” Job 9:22 “I declare.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Perfective Action: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Present Perfect: The subject is in a present state based
on a past action. Isaiah 1:4 “They have forsaken Jehovah.” Uses the English “have”
or “has.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Adjectival Perfect: This describes the condition of the
subject. Ruth 1:12 “I am too old to get married.” This is used with stative
intransitive verbs. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Stative, Transitive Perfect: Used to indicate affections
or states of mind. Num. 11:5 “We remember” I Sam. 2:1 “I rejoice” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Past Perfect: To indicate an event previous to a past
moment. I Sam. 28:3 “And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits....”
Ruth 1:6 “Because she had heard; also that Jehovah had visited his people.’’</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Future Perfect: To express the subject in the future and
the action of the verb previous to that. Isaiah 4:4, “When he shall have washed
away.” Gen. 28:15, “In the good land which he will have given you.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Perfect of Resolve: This is used to indicate that which
the subject has decided or resolved to do in the future. Ruth 4:3. Naomi has
decided to sell the field. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Prophetic Perfect: To express facts which are undoubtedly
imminent and, therefore, in the mind of the one speaking already fulfilled. Isaiah
5:13, “Therefore my people are gone (shall go) into captivity.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Imperfect Tense: </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Imperfect tense indicates progressive or incomplete
action. The uses of the imperfect have been divided into five categories.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Future Action: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Simple or Specific Future: This is the manner in which
most imperfects function. Gen. 2:17, “Dying you shall die.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Historical Future: This views a future event from the
standpoint of a past moment. 2 Kings 13:14, “Now Elisha was sick from the
sickness from which he would die.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Anterior Future: This is just like the future perfect.
Job 40:14, “Your own right hand shall have given you the victory.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Repeated action either in present or past time: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Habitual Imperfect: To express facts known by experience
which at any time may occur again. Something that is a universal truth. To
express actions which may be repeated at any time, or are customarily repeated
on a given occasion. Judges 11:40, “The daughters of Israel go yearly to
commemorate.” Deut. 1:44, “They pursued you as bees do (are accustomed to do).”
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Progressive Imperfect: To indicate actions which are in
progress, or are incomplete. Gen. 37:15, “What are you seeking? (What do you
seek?)”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Customary Imperfect: To indicate actions repeated in the
past, either at fixed intervals or occasionally. Job 1:5, “Thus did Job
continually.” Exodus 33:7, “And Moses used to take (every time) the tabernacle
and pitch it without the camp.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Aspects of Mood:</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Potential Imperfect: To indicate actions which are viewed
as possibly taking place or as not taking place. Gen. 6:21, “Take all the food
which is able to be eaten (which may be eaten or is edible).” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Permissive Imperfect: Where the action has the concept of
giving permission. Gen. 2:16, “Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat.”
Ruth 2:2, “You may go, my daughter.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Deliberative Imperfect: To indicate deliberation. Gen.
39:9, “How then can I....” Gen. 43:7, “Could we in any way know....” Ruth 1:21,
“For what reason then, should you call me Naomi?”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Imperfect of Obligation: To express an obligation or
necessity according to the judgment of another person. Ruth 3:4, “And he will
tell you what you should do (what you ought to do).” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Desiderative Imperfect: To indicate an expression of will
either definite intention and arrangement or a simple desire. Ruth 1:10, “We
desire to return with you to your people.” Ruth 1:16, “Where you shall go, I
desire to go, and at what place you shall spend the night, I desire to spend
the night.” Ruth 1:16, “Where you shall die, I desire to die and there I desire
to be buried.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Imperfect of Possibility: To indicate the concept of
possibility. Joshua 7:5 “Whoever may lap with his tongue from the water....” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Imperfect of Purpose: To indicate purpose. Exodus 4:5, “In
order that they might believe.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>To indicate the moods of volition: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Imperfect of Command: Urgent request or entreaty. Gen.
43:12; Psalms 17:8. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Imperfect of Instruction: To indicate legislation or
instruction. Exodus 12:11; Exodus 21:8; Lev. 19:32. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Imperfect of Prohibition: To express negative legislation
or instruction. This is commonly used with the negative, “lo.” Exodus 12:10; Exodus
20:13.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>To indicate past action with various adverbs: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Exodus 15:1; 1 Kings 3:16; Joshua 3:1; Exodus 12:34; Gen.
2:5; Gen. 19:4; Gen. 24:45; Gen. 27:33; Gen. 37:18.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Cohortative:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Resolve:</u> The expression of the will or the desire
of the one speaking. Gen. 45:28, “I will go down.” Exodus 3:3, “I will turn
aside.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Request:</u> Used of one person requesting permission
from someone else. Ruth 2:2, “Permit to go to the field.” Ruth 2:7, “Permit me
to glean.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Horatory:</u> This is one person encouraging another
to join him in a particular course of action. Gen. 37:17; Deut. 13:3,7,14.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Purpose:</u> To express an intention or intended
consequence. Gen. 27:4; Isaiah 5:19.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Jussive:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This can be viewed from two standpoints: (1) From one of
high rank to one of lower rank. (2) From one of low rank to one of higher rank.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>From one of high rank to one of lower rank:</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Commandment:
Gen. 1:3. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Counsel:
Deut. 20:5.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>From one of low rank to one of higher rank: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Demand of permission: 2 Sam. 19:38. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Advice: Gen. 41:33. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Desire: Gen. 30-34; Gen. 33:14. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Invitation: 2 Sam. 13:24. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Prayer: Exodus 34:9. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Blessing: Num. 6:24.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Jussive is also found frequently with the
negative, “al.”</u> </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Negative desire: Ruth 1:16; 1 Kings 2:20. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Negative prayer: Deut. 9:26; 1 Kings 2:20; Psalms 27:9; Psalms
69:18. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Prohibition: 1 Kings 13:22; Exodus 34:3.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Imperative</b>:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>To express permission:</u> Isaiah 21:12; Isaiah 45:11;
Gen. 50:6.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>To express real commands:</u> Gen. 12:1.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>To express a distinct assurance:</u> Isaiah 65:18; 2
Kings 19:29; Psalms 110:2.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>To express interjection:</u> Ruth 1:8; Exodus 32:1;
Gen. 11:3,7 This occurs when it immediately precedes a second imperative, and
most often with the words, halak, qum and yahabh.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>To express condition:</u> Gen. 42:18; Gen. 17:1; 1
Kings 22:12; Isaiah 36:16. Do this and live...if you do this, you will live.

18:22; 2 Sam. 21:3; 2 Sam. 21:3, “Wherewith shall I make atonement in order
that you may bless.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Waw Consecutive:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>With the imperfect tense it may function in any of the
capacities of the perfect tense. See above under the perfect tense.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>With the perfect tense it may function in any of the
capacities of the imperfect tense. See above under the imperfect tense.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For the other many and varied uses of the waw connective,
consult Hebrew lexicons and advanced grammars.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Participle:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The participle may function either verbally or
adjectivally.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Verbal usage:</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When used verbally, it expresses the concept of durative,
linear action and does not indicate time. Time must be determined by the
context. It may function in the area of past, present or future times. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Past time: The concept is durative, action in the past.
Compare with the Greek imperfect tense. 2 Sam 15:30, “And David was ascending
by the ascent of the Mount of Olives weeping as he was ascending.” Gen. 41:1; I
Kings 14:17; Gen. 39:3. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Present time: Gen. 4:10, “The voice of your brother’s
blood is crying to me.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Future instantaneous: To express action which is about to
occur but is dependent upon some other event occurring first. Gen. 6:17, “Behold,
I am bringing the flood (I am about to bring the flood” Deut. 1:20, “The land
which Jehovah is giving you (is about to give you).” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Future time: Stresses the continuous progress of the
action in the future. Gen. 7:4, “For in seven days I will be sending rain on
the earth.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Adjectival usage: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The adjectival participle does not express durative
action but expresses the basic quality of the verbal root that it is from.
There is no indication of time or aspect except through the context.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Used as an attributive adjective: Deut. 4:24; Gen. 35:3;
Ex. 11:5. 3. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Used as a predicate adjective: Deut. 3:21. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Used as a substantive: Amos 5:13; Gen. 26:11; 9:6.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some participles have actually their primary function as
a noun that indicates rank, office or occupation. Judge - Shophat; Priest -
Kohan; Watchman - Shomar; Shepherd - Roeh.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Infinitive Absolute:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is a verbal noun which expresses simply the basic
abstract verbal action of the root. It speaks of an action without any regard
to the agent or to the circumstances of time and mood under which it takes
place.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It may function as a noun or a verb.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As a noun it may function as a subject, object or
predicate nominative, but these uses are very infrequent. Examples: Prov. 8:21;
Isaiah 32:17; Isaiah 1:17.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It may also be used to add emphasis to the sentence and
when doing so it usually precedes the verb. There are various shades of this
emphasis so for a detailed analysis consult the advanced grammars.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is also used as an adverbial accusative which
describes the action of a previous verb. In this usage the infinitive absolute
will follow the verb. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Job 37:2, “Hear
attentively.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Num. 24:10, “You
have blessed them thoroughly.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sometimes there are two infinitive absolutes coordinated
with each other. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>To express an
accompanying or antithetical action or the aim to which the principle action is
directed. 1 Sam. 6:12, “Lowing as they went.” Isaiah 19:22, “Smiting and (but
also) healing again.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>To express the
long continuance of an action. Isaiah 6:9, “Hear you continually.” Jer. 6:29; Jer.
23:17; Gen. 19:9; Num. 11:32; Gen. 12:9, “And Abraham advanced continually
toward the south.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sometimes the infinitive absolute will function as a
finite verb. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>When it is
sufficient to simply mention the basic verbal idea. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Or, when the
writer uses a hurried or for some other reason, excited style. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>The finite verb
which precedes, will determine how the infinitive is to be rendered. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>References:
Dan. 9:5; Exodus 36:7; 1 Sam. 2:28; Jer. 14:5; Hag. 1:6; Zech. 12:10.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Infinitive Construct: </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This form, like the infinitive absolute, may represent a
verbal noun, but it is much more flexible in character than the infinitive
absolute. It is able to function in any of the cases.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As the subject of a verb: 1 Sam. 18:23; Jer. 2:17; Gen.
30:15; Isaiah 7:13; Gen. 2:18, “Not good is the being of man in his separation.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As the direct object of the verb: 1 Kings 3:7, “I know
not the going out or the coming in (I know not to go out and to come in).”
(With or without a preposition.)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As a genitive: Exodus 3:4, “A time of mourning and a time
of dancing.” Gen. 2:17; Gen. 29:7; Neh. 12:46. (With or without a preposition.)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The infinitive construct will have various uses with
prepositions, but the meaning will be based on the function of the preposition.
For detail one needs to consult the lexicon and the advanced grammar. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>The
prepositions “be” and “ke” are used basically to express time determinations. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>The preposition
“al” indicates a causal clause.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>The preposition
“le” is used to indicate many different concepts: direction towards, purpose,
aim, to introduce the object, to state motives or attendant circumstances,
consequence, result, obligation and degree.</p>
