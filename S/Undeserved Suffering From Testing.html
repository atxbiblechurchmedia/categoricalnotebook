<h2><a name="_Undeserved_Suffering_From"></a>Undeserved Suffering From Testing</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All suffering of the believer while filled with the Holy
Spirit is designed by God for your blessing. This is undeserved suffering. God adjusts
the suffering for the believer after confession of sin so the believer is able
to handle it using God's grace resources. Even the self-induced misery that you
brought on yourself by bad decisions will be reduced when filled with the Holy
Spirit.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Suffering is designed by God for our good because it
restrains us from sin, human good, and evil, just as our parents restrained us
as children. Suffering also challenges us to advance in the spiritual life just
as our parents challenged us to grow up as children.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Suffering under testing accelerates our spiritual growth.
The believer receives blessing from God under testing, produces divine good and
glorifies God when we pass the testing by relying only on God's grace
resources. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All suffering while filled with the Holy Spirit is
designed for your blessing, for the believer’s spiritual advance, for development
of spiritual discernment and divine wisdom, for applying common sense, and for
the correct application of <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine to the situation. All
suffering for blessing is designed by God. The believer’s spiritual advance
glorifies God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God never brings more suffering by testing to the
believer than they are able to bear. By using God's grace resources and
applying Bible doctrine, the believer is equipped to handle or endure the
testing and to thereby grow spiritually from it. 1 Cor. 10:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“No temptation has overtaken you but such as is common to man;
and God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are
able, but with the temptation will provide the way of escape also, so that you
will be able to endure it.” (1 Corinthians 10:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Testing and the undeserved suffering that comes with it
produces spiritual growth and spiritual endurance. This suffering is the means
of the believer establishing the right priorities in the spiritual life where
the consistent daily intake and application of Bible doctrine becomes number
one priority. James 1:2-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various
trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance. And let
endurance have its perfect result, so that you may be perfect and complete,
lacking in nothing.” (James 1:2-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer grows spiritually from the combination of
suffering with application of Bible doctrine resident in their soul. Some
believers have problems, but use God's grace resources to handle the problems
and use divine solutions from application of Bible doctrine to the problems.
This is suffering turned to blessing. When human solutions are tried, the
suffering intensifies.  God's grace solutions are the only solutions that work
in the spiritual life. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some believers simply react to people when they have
problems. They always think it’s someone else who has the problem and are blind
to the fact they are projecting their own flaws onto others. Some believers
have problems because they want their own solutions instead of God’s solutions.
1 Cor. 15:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward
me did not prove vain; but I labored even more than all of them, yet not I, but
the grace of God with me.” (1 Corinthians 15:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Undeserved suffering in testing focuses on God’s grace
and turns the believer to worship, love, and appreciate God. Undeserved
suffering develops the believer’s reliance on God’s grace resources instead of
their own. The believer cannot solve the reason for the suffering, but must
trust in divine solutions to the suffering. Consequently, as the believer grows
spiritually, each test brings additional spiritual application from the Bible
doctrine in their soul. The believer becomes more and more capable of applying
the believed Word of God to each test instead of their own weak human
capabilities and thus passing the tests. Blessing from God results. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer will suffer in their spiritual life because
they are representatives of Jesus Christ on earth. Belief in the Lord Jesus
Christ for salvation is an act of faith and is a mental attitude that has as
its object the Lord Jesus Christ. The believer suffers “for His sake” and
through this testing will rely more and more on God's grace and the enabling
power of the Holy Spirit than on their own abilities. When the believer falls
back onto their own abilities, they inherit deserved suffering and self-induced
misery from making bad decisions while out of fellowship. Phil. 1:29; 1 Peter
2:18-20; Phil. 3:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For to you it has been granted for Christ's sake, not only to
believe in Him, but also to suffer for His sake,” (Philippians 1:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Servants, be submissive to your masters with all respect, not
only to those who are good and gentle, but also to those who are unreasonable.
For this finds favor, if for the sake of conscience toward God a person bears
up under sorrows when suffering unjustly. For what credit is there if, when you
sin and are harshly treated, you endure it with patience? But if when you do
what is right and suffer for it you patiently endure it, this finds favor with
God.” (1 Peter 2:18-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection and the
fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death;” (Philippians 3:10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Philippians 1:29, “For to you” is the dative of
advantage of <span lang=EL>ο</span>̔́<span lang=EL>τι</span> (hoti) and means
because to you. “It has been granted” is the aorist passive indicative of <span
lang=EL>χαρι</span>́<span lang=EL>ζομαι</span> (charizomai) and means it was
given graciously, freely. Suffering is given to you on a grace basis. You are
graced out by God when given undeserved suffering.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The aorist tense means that in a point of time, you have
undeserved suffering. The passive voice means you receive it on a grace basis.
The indicative mood connotes the reality of God’s plan for you. It means
literally that it was given to you in the behalf of Christ - a substitutionary
proposition. Every Church Age believer personally represents the Lord Jesus
Christ on earth as a function of their priesthood and ambassadorship during
this stage of the Angelic Conflict. We are representing Him on the spiritual battlefield.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Philippians 1:29, “not only to believe in Him” is the
dramatic present active voice plus the directional preposition <span lang=EL>ει</span>̓<span
lang=EL>ς</span> (eis) and means towards. There is no suffering in believing in
Christ. The act itself has no undeserved suffering connotations. “But also” is <span
lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>λλα</span>́ <span lang=EL>και</span>́ (alla kai)
and very strongly introduces our purpose on this earth in the spiritual life.
“To suffer” is the present active infinitive of <span lang=EL>πα</span>́<span
lang=EL>σχω</span> (paschō). The dramatic present means in combat. The active
voice means the believer enters into combat. The infinitive mood means it is
God’s intent to put you under undeserved suffering in His behalf. In 1 Peter
2:7-8, “the stone which the builders rejected” refers to the Lord Jesus Christ.
Rom. 5:2-4; 1 Peter 2:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“through whom also we have obtained our introduction by faith
into this grace in which we stand; and we exult in hope of the glory of God.
And not only this, but we also exult in our tribulations, knowing that
tribulation brings about perseverance; and perseverance, proven character; and
proven character, hope;” (Romans 5:2-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“This precious value, then, is for you who believe; but for
those who disbelieve, &quot;THE STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS REJECTED, THIS BECAME
THE VERY CORNER stone,&quot; and, &quot;A STONE OF STUMBLING AND A ROCK OF
OFFENSE&quot;; for they stumble because they are disobedient to the word, and
to this doom they were also appointed.” (1 Peter 2:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For you have been called for this purpose, since Christ also
suffered for you, leaving you an example for you to follow in His steps,” (1
Peter 2:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Undeserved suffering insulates the believer against
arrogance and prepares them for future testing consistent with their level of
spiritual growth. Undeserved suffering from testing is provided by God with His
grace resources to empower the believer to advance to spiritual maturity. Prov.
19:8. </p>

<p class=Verses>“He who gets wisdom loves his own soul; He who keeps
understanding will find good.” (Proverbs 19:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Peter 1:6-8, “tested by fire” refers to the process
of refinement of gold. Fire increases the quality of the gold by removing
impurities. Similarly, undeserved suffering in testing changes the nature of
the believer and for the time they remain in fellowship applying the Bible
doctrine in their soul to the testing, they grow spiritually which is divine
good and is rewarded by blessing in life and eternal blessing at the Judgment
Seat of Christ.</p>

<p class=Verses>“In this you greatly rejoice, even though now for a little
while, if necessary, you have been distressed by various trials, so that the
proof of your faith, being more precious than gold which is perishable, even
though tested by fire, may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at
the revelation of Jesus Christ; and though you have not seen Him, you love Him,
and though you do not see Him now, but believe in Him, you greatly rejoice with
joy inexpressible and full of glory,” (1 Peter 1:6-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Why Believers Suffer During Testing</b> </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers suffer from rapid and accelerated construction
of the edification complex of the soul. James 1:1-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“James, a bond-servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, To
the twelve tribes who are dispersed abroad: Greetings. Consider it all joy, my
brethren, when you encounter various trials, knowing that the testing of your
faith produces endurance. And let endurance have its perfect result, so that
you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing. But if any of you lacks
wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach,
and it will be given to him. But he must ask in faith without any doubting, for
the one who doubts is like the surf of the sea, driven and tossed by the wind.”
(James 1:1-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers suffer from relationships with those who
suffer. 1 Cor. 12:26; Rom. 14:7; 1 Chron. 21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; if
one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.” (1 Corinthians 12:26,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For not one of us lives for himself, and not one dies for
himself;” (Romans 14:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers suffer from direct involvement in the Angelic
Conflict. 1 Peter 1:12; 1 Peter 3:17; Eph. 3:9-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves,
but you, in these things which now have been announced to you through those who
preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven—things into
which angels long to look.” (1 Peter 1:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For it is better, if God should will it so, that you suffer
for doing what is right rather than for doing what is wrong.” (1 Peter 3:17,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore I ask you not to lose heart at my tribulations on
your behalf, for they are your glory.” (Ephesians 3:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers suffer to demonstrate the power and provision
of God's grace. 2 Cor. 12:1-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, for
this reason, to keep me from exalting myself, there was given me a thorn in the
flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me—to keep me from exalting myself!” (2
Corinthians 12:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He has said to me, &quot;My grace is sufficient for you,
for power is perfected in weakness.&quot; Most gladly, therefore, I will rather
boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me.
Therefore I am well content with weaknesses, with insults, with distresses,
with persecutions, with difficulties, for Christ's sake; for when I am weak,
then I am strong.” (2 Corinthians 12:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers suffer while they learn the value of Bible doctrine
and grow spiritually. Psalms 119:67-68; Psalms 119:71.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Before I was afflicted I went astray, But now I keep Your
word. You are good and do good; Teach me Your statutes.” (Psalms 119:67-68,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“It is good for me that I was afflicted, That I may learn Your
statutes.” (Psalms 119:71, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers suffer from national disaster. Isaiah 59:15-21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Yes, truth is lacking; And he who turns aside from evil makes
himself a prey. Now the LORD saw, And it was displeasing in His sight that
there was no justice. And He saw that there was no man, And was astonished that
there was no one to intercede; Then His own arm brought salvation to Him, And
His righteousness upheld Him.” (Isaiah 59:15-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“According to their deeds, so He will repay, Wrath to His
adversaries, recompense to His enemies; To the coastlands He will make
recompense. So they will fear the name of the LORD from the west And His glory
from the rising of the sun, For He will come like a rushing stream Which the
wind of the LORD drives.” (Isaiah 59:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers suffer from war. Deut. 21; Deut. 24; Matt.
24:6-7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You will be hearing of wars and rumors of wars. See that
you are not frightened, for those things must take place, but that is not yet
the end. &quot;For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against
kingdom, and in various places there will be famines and earthquakes.” (Matthew
24:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers suffer in the process of dying. Dying grace is
provision of deliverance in extreme difficulty. Job 5:17-21; Psalms 33:19;
Psalms 56:13; Psalms 116:8. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/D/Dying%20Grace.html">Dying
Grace</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Behold, how happy is the man whom God reproves, So do not
despise the discipline of the Almighty. “For He inflicts pain, and gives
relief; He wounds, and His hands also heal. “From six troubles He will deliver
you, Even in seven evil will not touch you. “In famine He will redeem you from
death, And in war from the power of the sword. “You will be hidden from the
scourge of the tongue, And you will not be afraid of violence when it comes.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Job
5:17-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;To deliver their soul from death And to keep them alive
in famine.&quot;  (Psalms 33:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For You have delivered my soul from death, Indeed my feet
from stumbling, So that I may walk before God In the light of the
living.&quot;  (Psalms 56:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For You have rescued my soul from death, My eyes from
tears, My feet from stumbling.&quot;  (Psalms 116:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers suffer because of a specific spiritual gift
such as Paul suffered during his missionary journeys. See category on <a
href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/P/Paul%2C%20Missionary%20Journeys.html">Paul, Missionary Journeys</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Undeserved Suffering In Marriage</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Undeserved suffering allows you to really understand the
thinking of the Lord Jesus Christ as you grow spiritually and to also
understand the thinking of your spouse as they grow spiritually. Suffering
brings out character and endurance, reservoir and potentiality in people. It
proves your spiritual growth and dependence on God's grace resources. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In marriage, undeserved suffering can be beneficial for
the wife as she learns to love her husband in his absence even as she loves the
Lord Jesus Christ in His absence. The wife learns to love her children, absent
or present. The wife, via undeserved suffering, enables her home to have a biblical
climate of happiness. She has hope or confidence that there are better days
coming by application of Bible doctrine. Pressure isn’t lessened in spiritual
maturity, but varied. 1 Peter 1:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“so that the proof of your faith, being more precious than gold
which is perishable, even though tested by fire, may be found to result in
praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ;” (1 Peter 1:7,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When your spouse chews you out, shouts at you, condemns
what you did in good faith, you may think about giving up and returning the
hostility. If you do, you will enter into all kinds of mental attitude sins
with bitterness, hostility, the silent treatment, punishing them for decisions
they made, generally spreading your mental attitude sin environment throughout
the whole house. The worst form of this is criticizing your spouse in front of
your children.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Parents who raise their children in a loving grace
environment, teach their children Bible doctrine, live as a spiritual example
for them, teach them all about authority orientation, provide all the
opportunities that are available for their children’s future success may likely
have to endure times where their children do not seem to appreciate any of
their efforts. They may even seem to reject all they have provided and go in
the opposite direction. This is why being a parent is so hard a test. This is a
test of the parent’s unconditional love.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The opposite can also be true where the child does all
that they are told to do by their parents and still be treated as though they
are opposing them. This can be a tough authority orientation test for a young
believer still living in the home. This is a test of the child’s unconditional
love. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Unless you understand the spiritual purpose of undeserved
suffering - to grow spiritually by depending on God's grace resources instead
of your own human abilities, the result will be disillusionment, heartache,
loneliness, and depression. Heb. 12:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For consider Him who has endured such hostility by sinners
against Himself, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.” (Hebrews
12:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For a believing wife married to an unbelieving husband, if
she can understand the personal sins of her husband, but not let the pressure
from him elicit personal sins in her, the result can be a husband who becomes
positive to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. This is the wife demonstrating a
gracious attitude with unconditional <i>agapao</i> love. In 1 Peter 3:1-2,
“behavior” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>ναστροφη</span>́
(anastrophē) and means to conduct oneself in a manner becoming to God’s plan
in Bible doctrine. Peter loves this word, a favorite in his vocabulary. 1 Peter
3:4-5; 1 Peter 2:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“In the same way, you wives, be submissive to your own husbands
so that even if any of them are disobedient to the word, they may be won
without a word by the behavior of their wives, as they observe your chaste and
respectful behavior.” (1 Peter 3:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“but let it be the hidden person of the heart, with the
imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious in the
sight of God. For in this way in former times the holy women also, who hoped in
God, used to adorn themselves, being submissive to their own husbands;” (1
Peter 3:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For what credit is there if, when you sin and are harshly
treated, you endure it with patience? But if when you do what is right and
suffer for it you patiently endure it, this finds favor with God.” (1 Peter
2:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The wife’s role in marriage is the responder with the
husband in a leadership authority role. With both the husband and wife
exercising unconditional mental attitude love for each other, they will be able
to endure any undeserved suffering and thereby grow spiritually. Undeserved
suffering has as its reward, prayer between husband and wife. The marriage
becomes stronger with both demonstrating a mental attitude of grace orientation
and inner tranquility. 1 Peter 3:7; 1 Peter 3:8-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“You husbands in the same way, live with your wives in an
understanding way, as with someone weaker, since she is a woman; and show her
honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life, so that your prayers will not be
hindered.” (1 Peter 3:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“To sum up, all of you be harmonious, sympathetic, brotherly,
kindhearted, and humble in spirit; not returning evil for evil or insult for
insult, but giving a blessing instead; for you were called for the very purpose
that you might inherit a blessing.” (1 Peter 3:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If you are talking back to your spouse when they are
ranting and raving, nothing will be solved and this reaction could damage your
marriage relationship. God has provided the grace resources for the believer to
stay in fellowship under undeserved suffering and to refrain from mental
attitude sins that easily become verbal sins. When a husband or wife go from
mental attitude sins to sins of the tongue, they are on their way to destroying
themselves, their marriage, and other relationships. 1 Peter 1:15-16; 1 Peter
1:17-19; 1 Peter 2:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, always being ready
to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that
is in you, yet with gentleness and reverence; and keep a good conscience so
that in the thing in which you are slandered, those who revile your good
behavior in Christ will be put to shame.” (1 Peter 3:15-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“If you address as Father the One who impartially judges
according to each one's work, conduct yourselves in fear during the time of
your stay on earth; knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable things
like silver or gold from your futile way of life inherited from your
forefathers, but with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and spotless,
the blood of Christ.” (1 Peter 1:17-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles, so that in
the thing in which they slander you as evildoers, they may because of your good
deeds, as they observe them, glorify God in the day of visitation.” (1 Peter
2:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Undeserved suffering is the top priority doctrine in the
home and has to be learned before true happiness can exist in the home. This is
a doctrine that eventually coordinates the will of two people. In 1 Peter
3:11-12, “turn away” is <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>κκλι</span>́<span
lang=EL>νω</span> (ekklinō) and means to turn out of, to turn aside, to
deviate from the right way and course. Because she hates evil, she will stay
with divine good. As she hates evil, she will seek peace and pursue it. The
Lord will hear her prayer and the husband will learn the hard way. God will
keep him from harming you if you are living divine viewpoint. 1 Peter 3:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;HE MUST TURN AWAY FROM EVIL AND DO GOOD; HE MUST SEEK
PEACE AND PURSUE IT. &quot;FOR THE EYES OF THE LORD ARE TOWARD THE RIGHTEOUS,
AND HIS EARS ATTEND TO THEIR PRAYER, BUT THE FACE OF THE LORD IS AGAINST THOSE
WHO DO EVIL.&quot;” (1 Peter 3:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Who is there to harm you if you prove zealous for what is
good?” (1 Peter 3:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Undeserved Suffering Due to Friends</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer in undeserved suffering often takes the
brunt of the personal sins of others. This includes relatives, friends, job
associates, husband, wife or children. The seventh test for Job was the most
difficult test to pass. Job’s friends had ascribed darkness to Job. Their
personal sins were directed full force against Job. These men were the business
associates of Job. He had set them up with his capital. Job’s prosperity had
enabled these men to be something, then they turned on him. 1 Peter 2:11ff.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Beloved, I urge you as aliens and strangers to abstain from
fleshly lusts which wage war against the soul. Keep your behavior excellent
among the Gentiles, so that in the thing in which they slander you as
evildoers, they may because of your good deeds, as they observe them, glorify
God in the day of visitation.” (1 Peter 2:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Book of Job, Job was being tested to the maximum.
Starting in Job 3, Job failed the severe test due to his negative volition.
Great pressure was not the cause. Great riches was not the cause. Heredity was
not the cause. Environment was not the cause. Job’s mental attitude sins, sins
of the tongue, overt sinful activity, scar tissue, carnality, emotional revolt,
reversionism and friendship decisions took him in the wrong direction. He was
constantly rethinking the past. He wanted answers to his questions right now. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Job doubted the character of God and becomes dissatisfied
with creation. He thought the Word of God was not the answer. He regarded his
physical birth as a mistake. He regarded death as an insult. Job had fear
rather than love. Job disregarded Bible doctrine. He was thinking his own
thoughts through to a human viewpoint conclusion rather than following God’s
thoughts in the Word of God (Bible doctrine) through to a divine solution. See

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Undeserved Suffering From People With Negative
Volition </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Christ identified with our personal sins. His work on the
Cross made it possible to have sins forgiven, salvation to be possible to
anyone with positive volition, and to have fellowship with Him in the spiritual
life. Contact with the sins of all mankind in our Lord’s body on the Cross did
not cause Him to commit personal sins. Heb. 12:1-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses
surrounding us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so
easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before
us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the
joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at
the right hand of the throne of God. For consider Him who has endured such
hostility by sinners against Himself, so that you will not grow weary and lose
heart.” (Hebrews 12:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Undeserved suffering also comes from relatives and in-laws
who are negative the plan of God. You can be under undeserved suffering before spiritual
maturity. You will be able to handle it part of the time in practice. The
mature believer can handle undeserved suffering with full efficiency according
to God's plan. The Lord becomes your father when your family forsakes you.
Matt. 10:34; Luke 14:25-27; Matt. 12:47; Zech. 13:6; 2 Cor. 12:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Do not think that I came to bring peace on the earth; I
did not come to bring peace, but a sword.” (Matthew 10:34, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now large crowds were going along with Him; and He turned and
said to them, &quot;If anyone comes to Me, and does not hate his own father and
mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own
life, he cannot be My disciple. &quot;Whoever does not carry his own cross and
come after Me cannot be My disciple.” (Luke 14:25-27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;And one will say to him, 'What are these wounds between
your arms?' Then he will say, 'Those with which I was wounded in the house of
my friends.'” (Zechariah 13:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Here for this third time I am ready to come to you, and I will
not be a burden to you; for I do not seek what is yours, but you; for children
are not responsible to save up for their parents, but parents for their
children.” (2 Corinthians 12:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Undeserved suffering gives mental stability and happiness
instead of fear or a troubled spirit. In 1 Peter 3:14, “fear” is <span lang=EL>φοβε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span><span lang=EL> </span>(phobeō) and means to put to flight by
terrifying, to scare away, to fear, to be afraid. “Troubled” is <span lang=EL>ταρα</span>́<span
lang=EL>σσω</span> (tarassō) and means to agitate, to trouble, perplexity, to
disquiet, make restless, to strike one’s spirit with fear and dread, to render
anxious or distressed.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness,
you are blessed. AND DO NOT FEAR THEIR INTIMIDATION, AND DO NOT BE TROUBLED,”
(1 Peter 3:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Undeserved suffering enables you to answer or not answer
people who are negative as Christ did on the Cross. Actually this is the only
way some people will go positive to the Gospel. 1 Peter 3:15-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, always being ready
to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that
is in you, yet with gentleness and reverence; and keep a good conscience so
that in the thing in which you are slandered, those who revile your good
behavior in Christ will be put to shame. For it is better, if God should will
it so, that you suffer for doing what is right rather than for doing what is
wrong. For Christ also died for sins once for all, the just for the unjust, so
that He might bring us to God, having been put to death in the flesh, but made
alive in the spirit;” (1 Peter 3:15-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Undeserved suffering will take you through fiery and
strange trials with many of them unexplained. But remember, you are a partner
with Christ in undeserved suffering. You will be tempted in undeserved
suffering to exchange it for deserved suffering. 1 Peter 4:12; 1 Peter 4:14-16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you,
which comes upon you for your testing, as though some strange thing were
happening to you;” (1 Peter 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“If you are reviled for the name of Christ, you are blessed,
because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you. Make sure that none of you
suffers as a murderer, or thief, or evildoer, or a troublesome meddler; but if
anyone suffers as a Christian, he is not to be ashamed, but is to glorify God
in this name.” (1 Peter 4:14-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Deserved suffering means you have sinned and are no
longer filled with the Holy Spirit and your soul is controlled by your old sin
nature. When tested by others, you are tempted to fight back, to revile and
threaten rather than suffer humiliation which is what Christ suffered on the Cross.
In undeserved suffering you commit your cause to God. God is always fair. See
category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/S/Deserved%20Suffering.html">Deserved Suffering</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Undeserved suffering provides for promotion in due time,
so cast all your cares upon Him. The sources of undeserved suffering are your
old sin nature and Satan’s world system of evil. This was so for Jesus Christ
on the Cross. 1 Peter 5:6; 1 Peter 5:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that
He may exalt you at the proper time,” (1 Peter 5:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Be of sober spirit, be on the alert. Your adversary, the
devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.” (1 Peter
5:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The time benefits of undeserved suffering in the
spiritual life are to mend your blind spots and tragic flaws. In 1 Peter 5:10,
“perfect” is <span lang=EL>καταρτι</span>́<span lang=EL>ζω</span> (katartizō)
and means to render, to complete, to mend what has been broken or rent, to
repair. To “confirm” is <span lang=EL>στηρι</span>́<span lang=EL>ζω</span>
(stērizō) and means to make stable, to make firm, to set fast, to fix, to
strengthen. “Stengthen” is <span lang=EL>σθενο</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(sthenoō) and means to strengthen weak areas. “Establish” is <span lang=EL>θεμελιο</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (themelioō) and means to lay a foundation.</p>

<p class=Verses>“After you have suffered for a little while, the God of all
grace, who called you to His eternal glory in Christ, will Himself perfect,
confirm, strengthen and establish you.” (1 Peter 5:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Undeserved Suffering From Satan’s World System of Evil</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Undeserved suffering comes to the believer in fellowship
as pressure from the world, the old sin nature, and Satan as they relate to
people. This forms a temptation to conform to Satan’s program. The world, the sin
nature, and the devil form a trinity of evil to get the believer to sin and
remain in carnality thus converting their undeserved suffering to deserved
suffering as divine discipline. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The personal sins of people constitute the greatest
attack on your undeserved suffering. 1 John 1:9 is how you deal with your sins.
Undeserved suffering is how you deal with sins of others. You must learn to not
be reactive to other believers who are out of fellowship and yet still be
responsive to the Lord.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Maximum undeserved suffering has to do with personal sins
of friends coercing your volition and may include pressure of potential death. Undeserved
suffering also comes from helpless and hopeless situations. This is where there
is maximum divine good production. Job 1-2. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is always fair to the grace oriented believer
regardless of the allotment of undeserved suffering. Testing is the
solicitation to blessing. Temptation is the solicitation to evil.</p>
