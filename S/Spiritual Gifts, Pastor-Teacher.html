<h2>Spiritual Gifts, Pastor-Teacher</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The spiritual gift of pastor-teacher is God’s means for
the communication of the mystery doctrine of the Church Age to every believer.
The spiritual gift of pastor-teacher is sovereignly bestowed by the Holy Spirit
at salvation totally apart from any human merit or ability. This is true for
all spiritual gifts in the Church Age. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This gift enables the trained and prepared pastor-teacher
to go directly to the Canon of Scripture and dig out divine policy himself,
grow spiritually based on his personal study of the Word of God, and
communicate Bible doctrine in public after proper preparation. Thus, the Body
of Christ grows spiritually. Only the spiritual gift of pastor-teacher has both
authority from God and ability from the spiritual gift to provide the necessary
doctrinal information for the believer to learn of and fulfill God's plan for
their life. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The gift of pastor-teacher is one of two permanent
communication spiritual gifts provided by God the Holy Spirit at salvation to a
small percentage of male believers only. The other permanent communication
spiritual gift for the Church Age is evangelism. All kinds of different
personalities receive this gift. No one type of character or personality should
be stereotyped as that of a pastor-teacher. Only with spiritual growth can the
believer come to the knowledge that he has this important communication spiritual
gift.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Pastor-teacher is the highest communication gift for the
Church Age and is designed to function only within the local church. This
spiritual gift will function only for the Church Age. After the Rapture of the
Church, this gift will cease on earth.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor is not an administrator. He is a policy maker.
A pastor is a pastor by virtue of his spiritual gift. He didn’t earn it or
deserve it. These are given out by the decree of God and it is based on His
sovereign plan. Eph. 4:11; Eph. 3:7-10; Rom. 12:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and
some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers,&quot;  (Ephesians 4:11,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;of which I was made a minister, according to the gift of
God's grace which was given to me according to the working of His power. To me,
the very least of all saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles
the unfathomable riches of Christ, and to bring to light what is the
administration of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God who created
all things; so that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known through
the church to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly places. &quot; 
(Ephesians 3:7-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;if service, in his serving; or he who teaches, in his
teaching;&quot;  (Romans 12:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ephesians 4:11, “pastors” is <span lang=EL>ποιμη</span>́<span
lang=EL>ν</span> (poimēn) in the Greek and means a shepherd, one who tends
herds or flocks of sheep. The word “teachers” is <span lang=EL>διδα</span>́<span
lang=EL>σκαλος</span> (didaskalos) and is used for one person teaching a group
of people in public assembly. The coordinate conjunction <span lang=EL>και</span>
(kai) coordinates the two nouns pastor and teacher, resulting in the correct
term of “pastor-teacher.” This is technically known as an hendiadys in which
two nouns are joined by a conjunction to express one idea. The term “pastor”
emphasizes his authority in communication and “teacher” emphasizes his function.
The pastor-teacher is a shepherd who teaches.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Identification of the Spiritual Gift </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In every Church Age generation, the Holy Spirit provides
some men with the spiritual gift of pastor-teacher. They have all kinds of
personalities, just as we all do. Because of that normal human condition, many
male believers with the gift of pastor-teacher never become pastors of local
churches. Some never discover that they have the spiritual gift of
pastor-teacher. This may be due to negative volition toward Bible doctrine.
Spiritual growth is the only path to discovery of this gift. This gift is not
discovered emotionally, but rationally through the perception of Bible doctrine.
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some discover that they have the spiritual gift, but
become distracted by romance or an early marriage. They can become distracted
by having a family before they can adequately prepare for the ministry. They
can become distracted by technical or financial success in business or in
another profession. Success can be very stimulating and can be difficult to
turn from to prepare academically for the ministry. Of all the professions in
life, the gift of pastor-teacher takes more consistent pursuit, energy, and time
to prepare for the ministry. Preparation is everything.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Identification of this spiritual gift is not simple
because it demands persistence in the perception of doctrine. It is not
connected with emotion. No feeling should lead or guide you. You have to know
from <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in your soul and have confidence from that
knowledge. If you identify your gift too late for proper preparation, don't be
concerned because God uses that gift in many other ways. After the individual
male recognizes his spiritual gift and prepares for it, then the Bible demands
that some local church recognize his spiritual gift through the ritual of
ordination. Eventually, some local church will recognize him by calling him to
be their pastor.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some male believers discover their spiritual gift and
prepare themselves for the ministry and then find they have no opportunity to
use their communication gift. In a nation where negative volition becomes
predominant, the demand for grace oriented Bible-teaching pastors diminishes.
God honors this category of men in other functions of life. God can bless in
many ways, not only in business and professional careers, but also in his
relationships in life with wife, family, and friends. In contrast, in positive
generations, there may not be enough prepared pastors to meet the spiritual
demand. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Also, some male believers may discover their spiritual
gift, prepare themselves, and even enter some form of Christian service
compatible with their gift. They can become pastors of local churches,
professors, teachers in seminaries or Bible schools, writers, administrators
and teachers in Christian service organizations, or missionaries. From God's absolute
wisdom related to His omniscience, God the Holy Spirit always over supplies.
There are always more men with the gift of pastor-teacher than men who will
actually use it.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><a name="_The_Gift_of_1"></a><b>Greek Words Defining
Functions of the Pastor-Teacher </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Several words are used in the New Testament for the
pastor of a local church. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Episkopos</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 20:28, the word “overseers” is <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span
lang=EL>πι</span>́<span lang=EL>σκοπος</span> (episkopos) in the Greek and also
means a man charged with the duty of seeing that things to be done by others
are done rightly, an elder, curator, supervisor, guardian, policy maker, or
superintendent. This refers to the function of a pastor and speaks of a
shepherd looking after his flock. By teaching Bible doctrine, the pastor-teacher
becomes the guardian of the congregation in the sense that he is the chief
policy maker for the local church. His policy making is based upon his teaching
of the Word of God. <i>Episkopos</i> is also used in Titus 1:7, Philippians 1:1,
1 Peter 2:25, 1 Peter 5:2, and 1 Timothy 3:1-2; Acts 20:28.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock,
among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of
God which He purchased with His own blood.&quot;  (Acts 20:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For the overseer must be above reproach as God's steward,
not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not addicted to wine, not pugnacious, not
fond of sordid gain,&quot;  (Titus 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus, To all
the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, including the overseers and
deacons:&quot;  (Philippians 1:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For you were continually straying like sheep, but now you
have returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls.&quot;  (1 Peter 2:25,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;shepherd the flock of God among you, exercising oversight
not under compulsion, but voluntarily, according to the will of God; and not
for sordid gain, but with eagerness;&quot;  (1 Peter 5:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;It is a trustworthy statement: if any man aspires to the
office of overseer, it is a fine work he desires to do. An overseer, then, must
be above reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, prudent, respectable,
hospitable, able to teach,&quot;  (1 Timothy 3:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock, among which
the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God which He
purchased with His own blood.”  (Acts 20:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A pastor-teacher’s function is to establish local church
policy based on grace. This includes the pastor-teacher acting as a guardian to
protect the believers’ privacy should others in the local church enter into gossip,
maligning, or judging of others.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher must also delegate authority to other
mature believers in the congregation that he recognizes as having the spiritual
gift of Administration to act as members of the church board of deacons. Their
function is to handle church operations and administration, thus leaving the
pastor-teacher to study and teaching with the confidence that they are handling
everything based on grace. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Diakonos</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 3:5, <span lang=EL>δια</span>́<span
lang=EL>κονος</span> (diakonos) means minister, servant, or waiter. This refers
to any believer who administrates or ministers, like deacons, but when it
refers to a pastor-teacher, it emphasizes his daily routine, his actual
ministry as observed overtly. This Greek noun means a servant in the sense of
spiritual power. A good translation is “minister” when it applies to the
pastor-teacher. <i>Diakonos</i> also occurs in the following verses. Eph. 3:7;
Col. 1:7; Col. 1:23; Col. 4:7; 1 Thess. 3:2; Heb. 6:10; Acts 6:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? Servants through
whom you believed, even as the Lord gave opportunity to each one.&quot;  (1
Corinthians 3:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;of which I was made a minister, according to the gift of
God's grace which was given to me according to the working of His power.&quot; 
(Ephesians 3:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For God is not unjust so as to forget your work and the
love which you have shown toward His name, in having ministered and in still
ministering to the saints.&quot;  (Hebrews 6:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Presbuteros</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 20:17, the word “elder” is <span lang=EL>πρεσβυ</span>́<span
lang=EL>τερος</span> (presbuteros) and means “old man” and is a word of rank
and authority. <i>Presbuteros</i> means “the old man” in the sense of being in
the highest authority, commander, commanding officer, or elder. The pastor may
be young, but he is the ranking officer in that local church or the final
authority in the local church based on the Word. It refers to the authority of
the pastor. Every local church has only one commander. There's no such thing as
plurality of elders. 1 Tim. 5:17; 1 Tim. 5:19; Titus 1:5; James 5:14; James 1:5;
1 Peter 5:1; 2 John 1:1; 3 John 1:1; Heb. 13:7; Heb. 13:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;From Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called to him the
elders of the church.&quot;  (Acts 20:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The elders who rule well are to be considered worthy of
double honor, especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching.&quot; 
(1 Timothy 5:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Is anyone among you sick? Then he must call for the
elders of the church and they are to pray over him, anointing him with oil in
the name of the Lord;&quot;  (James 5:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in
truth.&quot;  (3 John 1:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Remember those who led you, who spoke the word of God to you;
and considering the result of their conduct, imitate their faith.”  (Hebrews
13:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch over
your souls as those who will give an account. Let them do this with joy and not
with grief, for this would be unprofitable for you.”  (Hebrews 13:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Bosko</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 21:15 and John 21:17, <span lang=EL>βο</span>́<span
lang=EL>σκω</span> (boskō) means to nourish, to teach Bible doctrine. It means
to minister to mature believers who are under terrific pressure. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So when they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon
Peter, &quot;Simon, son of John, do you love Me more than these?&quot; He said
to Him, &quot;Yes, Lord; You know that I love You.&quot; He said to him,
&quot;Tend My lambs.&quot;&quot;  (John 21:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Proistēmi</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Thessalonians 5:12-13, the phrase “have charge over
you” is <span lang=EL>προι</span>̈́́<span lang=EL>στημι</span> (proistēmi) and
means to put before, to set over, to rule, have charge over. The word
“instruction” is <span lang=EL>νουθετε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(noutheteō) and means to admonish, warn, exhort.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But we request of you, brethren, that you appreciate
those who diligently labor among you, and have charge over you in the Lord and
give you instruction, and that you esteem them very highly in love because of
their work. Live in peace with one another.&quot;  (1 Thessalonians 5:12-13,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He said to him the third time, &quot;Simon, son of John, do
you love Me?&quot; Peter was grieved because He said to him the third time,
&quot;Do you love Me?&quot; And he said to Him, &quot;Lord, You know all
things; You know that I love You.&quot; Jesus said to him, &quot;Tend My
sheep.” (John 21:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The phrase “esteem them very highly in love” is <span
lang=EL>υ</span>̔<span lang=EL>περεκπερισσω</span>͂<span lang=EL>ς</span>
(huperekperissōs) + <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>γα</span>́<span
lang=EL>πη</span> (agapē) and means to have a mental attitude love for them beyond
measure, exceedingly, very highly, over and above out of super abundance. This
applies to the believers in the congregation. They are to esteem beyond all
measure their pastor.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Epipotheō </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 1:11 and Philippians 2:26, “to long” is the
present active participle of <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>πιποθε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (epipotheō) + the imperfect active indicative of <span
lang=EL>ει</span>̓<span lang=EL>μι</span>́ (eimi). This is called an imperfect
periphrastic and is a very strong word for love, a very strong desire or
affection. It is as strong a statement as you can make. His love for the
Philippians was as strong as his love could be. The periphrastic indicates
durative force. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For I long to see you so that I may impart some spiritual
gift to you, that you may be established;&quot;  (Romans 1:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;because he was longing for you all and was distressed
because you had heard that he was sick.&quot;  (Philippians 2:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The phrase “was distressed” is the present active
participle of <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>δημονε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(adēmoneō) and means to be troubled, great distress or anguish, depressed.
Absence from those you love with a deep capacity causes distress of soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Poimen</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Pastors is <span lang=EL>ποιμη</span>́<span lang=EL>ν</span>
(poimēn) and refers to pastor-teachers as shepherds. Eph. 4:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some
as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers,”  (Ephesians 4:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Pastor-Teacher’s Responsibilities</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A pastor-teacher is held responsible to give an account
of the soul status of his congregation. In Hebrews 13:17, “obey” is the present
middle imperative of <span lang=EL>πει</span>́<span lang=EL>θω</span> (peithō)
and means to convince or persuade through authority. The word “leaders” is the
present middle participle of <span lang=EL>η</span>̔<span lang=EL>γε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ομαι</span> (hēgeomai) and means to lead or guide, the chief speaker.
Acts 14:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch
over your souls as those who will give an account. Let them do this with joy
and not with grief, for this would be unprofitable for you.&quot;  (Hebrews
13:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And they began calling Barnabas, Zeus, and Paul, Hermes,
because he was the chief speaker.&quot;  (Acts 14:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To “submit” is the present active imperative of <span
lang=EL>υ</span>̔<span lang=EL>πει</span>́<span lang=EL>κω</span> (hupeikō)
and means to yield under. To “keep watch” is the present active indicative of <span
lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>γρυπνε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (agrupneō)
and means to keep awake, to be on the alert, to watch and guard. Eph. 6:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;With all prayer and petition pray at all times in the
Spirit, and with this in view, be on the alert with all perseverance and
petition for all the saints,&quot;  (Ephesians 6:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 13:17, “give an account” is the future active
participle of <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>ποδι</span>́<span lang=EL>δωμι</span>
(apodidōmi) and means to render account. “Let them do” is the present active
subjunctive of <span lang=EL>ποιε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (poieō) and
means to do, to make.  The word “grief” is the present active participle of <span
lang=EL>στενα</span>́<span lang=EL>ζω</span> (stenazō) and means to sigh,
groan or complain.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A translation of Hebrews 13:17 is, “You, yourself keep on
obeying (submission to proven authority) the ones who themselves are the chief
speakers even yielding under (them) for they keep on guarding over your souls
as they that will render account, that they may do it joy and not with sighing,
groaning, complaining.” 3 John 1:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I have no greater joy than this, to hear of my children
walking in the truth.&quot;  (3 John 1:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the context, the accounting is at the fifth cycle of
discipline, three years later in 70 AD and also refers to the Judgment Seat of
Christ. The under-shepherd gives an account of his pasture wandering at the end
of the season to the owner-shepherd.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher is the total product of grace and the
plan of God. 1 Cor. 15:10; Eph. 3:7; 1 Tim. 1:12-16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace
toward me did not prove vain; but I labored even more than all of them, yet not
I, but the grace of God with me.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 15:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;of which I was made a minister, according to the gift of
God's grace which was given to me according to the working of His power.&quot; 
(Ephesians 3:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher must always be grace oriented in
dealing with troublemakers, opposers, and must be spiritually mature enough to
be consistent and “not a new convert” as mentioned in 1 Timothy 3:6. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and not a new convert, so that he will not become
conceited and fall into the condemnation incurred by the devil.&quot;  (1
Timothy 3:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He must have authority from his ability in his developed
spiritual gift to teach Bible doctrine. It is not for the pastor to argue with
someone, but to be gracious and treat them on the basis of what he knows, not
on the basis of what they do not know. That is one-on-one again and that is why
questions take away from his authority. 2 Tim. 2:24. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The Lord's bond-servant must not be quarrelsome, but be
kind to all, able to teach, patient when wronged,&quot;  (2 Timothy 2:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher must stay in fellowship when dealing
with cantankerous believers. The pastor cannot afford to let them get the best
of him. Analogous situations were frequently used by Greek writers to
characterize a nurse with trying children, or a teacher with rebellious
students, or a parent with a mouthy child. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Timothy 2:24, the phrase “to all” means the
pastor-teacher must be gracious by cranking out Bible doctrine in public
assembly. “Able to teach” means he is qualified to teach and skillful in
teaching. There is only one way to teach like this and that is to study until
your brains fry. To be “patient” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>νεξι</span>́<span
lang=EL>κακος</span> (anexikakos) and means to endure the pressure of the fact
they don’t get it. To bear the pressure with his mind on the job. If they don’t
get it the first time, teach it again. Tell them to just stick with it and be
persistent. Maybe they need some other doctrines first. They should come to all
the Bible classes that are available and augment those face-to-face lessons
with recordings of the pastor’s past lessons.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Timothy 2:25, “with gentleness” is <span lang=EL>πρα</span>ͅ<span
lang=EL>ο</span>́<span lang=EL>της</span> (praotēs) and means grace
orientation. “Correcting those” is <span lang=EL>παιδευ</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(paideuō) and means to teach them the principle. Then, if they don’t seem to
“get it” then teach it again more aggressively with a slightly different
approach. The pastor-teacher should teach the Bible doctrine and when they
don’t seem to be absorbing it, change tactics or illustrations and teach it
again.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;with gentleness correcting those who are in opposition,
if perhaps God may grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the
truth,&quot;  (2 Timothy 2:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The phrase “those who are in opposition” refers to mental
opposition with the result that they don’t buy into the Bible doctrine being
taught. They are negative. “If perhaps God may grant them” is the aorist
optative and means that there is a remote possibility that they will recover
and get positive to Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Let’s say there is a hard core group in your church. When
the pastor gets tough on them with Bible doctrine, a small percentage will get
straightened out and go for Bible doctrine. But once a believer goes negative,
it is rare that they go back to positive. In fact it is so rare, it’s a
miracle. “Repentance” is a change of mental attitude toward Bible doctrine. You
can’t change them, but God may be able to. <i>Didasko</i> is one type of
teaching, <i>paideuo</i> is really being tough and laying it on the line. You
get tough with the rebels to protect the rest of the sheep from them.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Knowledge of the truth” is <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span
lang=EL>πι</span>́<span lang=EL>γνωσις</span> (epignōsis) and is full
knowledge or the Bible doctrine believed and transferred to the right lobe of
the soul as applicable to life’s problems, decisions, and situations. A
corrected translation is, “If there is an outside chance that God would give them
a complete change of mental attitude resulting in full know ledge of doctrine.”
Why? </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Timothy 2:26, “snare of the devil” always refers to
false doctrine. The devil captures the believer with thoughts. “Held captive”
is the perfect passive participle of <span lang=EL>ζωγρε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(zōgreō) and means to take alive, to take, to catch, to capture. The job of
the pastor is to drive out those who are captured alive by the devil. They are
taken captive by their thoughts.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and they may come to their senses and escape from the
snare of the devil, having been held captive by him to do his will.&quot;  (2
Timothy 2:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher must have that split second timing
that rides the local church through a crisis. The application of pertinent
Bible doctrine to pertinent problems is the key. In 2 Timothy 4:5, “be sober in
all things” is the present active imperative of <span lang=EL>νη</span>́<span
lang=EL>φω</span> (nēphō) and means to be sober, abstain from wine, be
morally alert, calm, circumspect.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But you, be sober in all things, endure hardship, do the
work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.&quot;  (2 Timothy 4:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A pastor-teacher’s ministry is only finished when he goes
to be with the Lord. He dies with his boots on. 2 Cor. 5:8; 2 Tim. 4:6-8. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;we are of good courage, I say, and prefer rather to be
absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord.&quot;  (2 Corinthians
5:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For I am already being poured out as a drink offering,
and the time of my departure has come. I have fought the good fight, I have
finished the course, I have kept the faith; in the future there is laid up for
me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award
to me on that day; and not only to me, but also to all who have loved His
appearing.&quot;  (2 Timothy 4:6-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Understanding The Spiritual Gift</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ephesians 4:1, “walk in a manner worthy of the calling”
is speaking of our salvation and the spiritual gift that was given at the
moment of salvation. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord, implore you to
walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called,&quot; 
(Ephesians 4:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ephesians 4:2, “humility” is <span lang=EL>ταπεινοφροσυ</span>́<span
lang=EL>νη</span> (tapeinophrosunē) and means lowliness of mind, humility,
humility of mind.  It is a combination of a mind word + positive volition or <span
lang=EL>ταπεινος</span> (lowly) + <span lang=EL>φρονεω</span> (thinking). It
means that you should have no illusions about yourself or your spiritual gift. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;with all humility and gentleness, with patience, showing
tolerance for one another in love,&quot;  (Ephesians 4:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You were saved by grace! You received your spiritual gift
by grace! Humility means a relaxed mental attitude from the headquarters of the
right lobe of your soul. “Patience” is <span lang=EL>μακροθυμι</span>́<span
lang=EL>α</span> (makrothumia) from <span lang=EL>μακρος</span> (long) + <span
lang=EL>θυμος</span> (temper) or to be long-tempered. Being short-tempered is
impatience. Impatience coupled with trials makes one doubleminded. James 1:5-8.
</p>

<p class=Verses>“But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives
to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him. But he
must ask in faith without any doubting, for the one who doubts is like the surf
of the sea, driven and tossed by the wind. For that man ought not to expect
that he will receive anything from the Lord, being a double-minded man,
unstable in all his ways.” (James 1:5-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Hot-tempered pastor-teachers must let Bible doctrine
equalize that problem. “Tolerance” is the present middle participle of <span
lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>νε</span>́<span lang=EL>χομαι</span>
(anechomai). The middle voice means you are benefitted. It is from <span
lang=EL>ανα</span> (up) + <span lang=EL>εχω</span> (to have or hold) and means
to hold up, to bear, to endure. “In love” is <span lang=EL>εν</span><span
lang=EL> </span><span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>γα</span>́<span lang=EL>πη</span>
(en agapē) and means “enduring in the sphere of mental attitude love” with no
grudges and no mental attitude sins. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ephesians 4:3, “being diligent” is <span lang=EL>σπουδα</span>́<span
lang=EL>ζω</span> (spoudazō) means to exert one’s self, to endeavor, to make
every effort, to give diligence. This is a word for taking in Bible doctrine
and is the same word used in  2 Timothy 2:15, 2 Peter 1:10, and 2 Peter 1:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the
bond of peace.&quot;  (Ephesians 4:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a
workman who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of
truth.&quot;  (2 Timothy 2:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore, brethren, be all the more diligent to make
certain about His calling and choosing you; for as long as you practice these
things, you will never stumble;&quot;  (2 Peter 1:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And I will also be diligent that at any time after my
departure you will be able to call these things to mind.&quot;  (2 Peter 1:15,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ephesians 4:3, “unity” is <span lang=EL>ε</span>̔<span
lang=EL>νο</span>́<span lang=EL>της</span> (henotēs) from the neuter of <span
lang=EL>ει</span>̔͂<span lang=EL>ς</span> (heis) and means oneness, oneness of
the Spirit, the sovereignty of the Holy Spirit. Only He unifies. There is no
unity in political internationalism or religious internationalism. The Holy
Spirit alone unifies and gives peace to the Body of Christ. He gives the
enablement - the spiritual gift. “Bond” is <span lang=EL>συ</span>́<span
lang=EL>νδεσμος</span> (sundesmos) means that which binds together. The Holy
Spirit produces peace! The seven unities are listed in Ephesians 4:4-6. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;There is one body and one Spirit, just as also you were
called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God
and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all.&quot;  (Ephesians
4:4-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Biblically Equipping </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual gifts are given on the basis of the
resurrection and ascension of Christ. Spiritual gifts are also given on the
basis of the grace of the measurement of Christ. Eph. 4:7-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But to each one of us grace was given according to the
measure of Christ's gift. Therefore it says, &quot;WHEN HE ASCENDED ON HIGH, HE
LED CAPTIVE A HOST OF CAPTIVES, AND HE GAVE GIFTS TO MEN.&quot; (Now this
expression, &quot;He ascended,&quot; what does it mean except that He also had
descended into the lower parts of the earth?&quot;  (Ephesians 4:7-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The communication spiritual gifts were conveyed. These
are communication gifts that carry with them the authority to communicate
clearly the Word of Truth. Not all spiritual gifts are communication gifts. Eph.
4:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and
some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers,&quot;  (Ephesians 4:11,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Apostles were the highest spiritual gift of the New
Testament and ceased with the passing of the Apostle John. Prophets were the
highest office in the Old Testament and number two in the Church Age. This gift
passed on with the completion of the written Canon in 96 AD. Evangelism is the
divine enablement to communicate the Gospel to the unbeliever and to present
clearly and effectively God's plan of salvation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Three Greek words describe the pastor-teacher gift. In
Ephesians 4:11, <span lang=EL>ποιμη</span>́<span lang=EL>ν</span> (poimēn)
expresses the office of pastor and the relationship of the office. Under the
Great Shepherd with responsibility to the sheep. John 10. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 20:17, the word “elder” is <span lang=EL>πρεσβυ</span>́<span
lang=EL>τερος</span> (presbuteros) and means “old man” and is a word of rank
and authority. <i>Presbuteros</i> means “the old man” in the sense of being in
the highest authority, commander, commanding officer, ranking admiral of the
fleet, elder, someone in authority. It refers to the authority of the pastor. Just
as an admiral is the final authority on a ship, so the pastor-teacher is the
final authority in the local church. The deacon board is not. The congregation
is not. He is responsible directly to God! Every local church has only one
commander. There's no such thing as plurality of elders. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;From Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called to him the
elders of the church.&quot;  (Acts 20:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 20:28, the word “overseers” is <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span
lang=EL>πι</span>́<span lang=EL>σκοπος</span> (episkopos) in the Greek and also
means a man charged with the duty of seeing that things to be done by others
are done rightly, an elder, curator, supervisor, guardian, policy maker, or
superintendent. By teaching Bible doctrine, the pastor-teacher becomes the
guardian of the congregation in the sense that he is the chief policy maker for
the local church. His policy making is based upon his teaching of the Word of
God. You must know what is going on and you’ve got to be on the job every day
with few exceptions.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock,
among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of
God which He purchased with His own blood.&quot;  (Acts 20:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Grace Gifts Utilized</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The gift of pastor-teacher is used for face-to-face
teaching. In Ephesians 4:12, “equipping the saints” is <span lang=EL>καταρτισμο</span>́<span
lang=EL>ς</span> (katartismos) and means complete furnishing, equipping,
perfecting. “For the work of service” emphasizes edifying the saints by giving
them Bible doctrine so they can grow spiritually by building an edification
complex in their souls. This spiritual maturity results in the function of
their spiritual gifts which as all for the “building up of the Body of
Christ.”  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;for the equipping of the saints for the work of service,
to the building up of the body of Christ;&quot;  (Ephesians 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The gift of pastor-teacher is used to mature the saints and
to side-step the maze of false doctrine.. Eph. 4:13-14. </p>

<p class=Verses>“until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the
knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature
which belongs to the fullness of Christ. As a result, we are no longer to be
children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of
doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming;”
(Ephesians 4:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The gift of pastor-teacher is used to mature the
believers spiritually. In Ephesians 4:15, “speaking the truth in love” is the
present active participle of <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>ληθευ</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (alētheuō) and means to speak or tell the truth, to profess
the truth. “In love” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>γα</span>́<span
lang=EL>πη</span> (agapē) and is a relaxed mental attitude love based on the
character of the pastor-teacher and his spiritual maturity. “To grow up” is the
aorist active subjunctive of <span lang=EL>αυ</span>̓<span lang=EL>ξα</span>́<span
lang=EL>νω</span> (auxanō) and means to cause growth, to grow up, to mature.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all
aspects into Him who is the head, even Christ,&quot;  (Ephesians 4:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The gift of pastor-teacher is used to complete God's plan
for spiritual growth of the believers being taught by the communication of
Bible doctrine. Eph. 4:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together
by what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each
individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in
love.&quot;  (Ephesians 4:16, NASB)</p>
