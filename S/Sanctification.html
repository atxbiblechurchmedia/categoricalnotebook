<h2><a name="_Sanctification"></a><a name="_D-Sanctification"></a>Sanctification</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sanctification describes the means whereby God the Father
makes the believer more and more like His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ. Sanctification
is grace in function. In 1 Corinthians 1:2, “sanctified” <span lang=EL>α</span>̔<span
lang=EL>για</span>́<span lang=EL>ζω</span> (hagiazō) in the Greek and means to
be set apart unto God. This Greek word is the root word for other English words
such as holy, holiness, sanctification, consecrate, and sanctify. The Church
Age believer is called a saint or one set apart. </p>

<p class=Verses>“To the church of God which is at Corinth, to those who have
been sanctified in Christ Jesus, saints by calling, with all who in every place
call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours:” (1 Corinthians
1:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The agents of sanctification are always the work of God,
not man. God the Son is the provision through His work on the Cross. God the
Holy Spirit provided the means or empowerment of sanctification. Heb. 10:10-14;
1 Peter 1:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“By this will we have been sanctified through the offering of
the body of Jesus Christ once for all. Every priest stands daily ministering
and offering time after time the same sacrifices, which can never take away
sins; but He, having offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, SAT DOWN AT
THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD, waiting from that time onward UNTIL HIS ENEMIES BE MADE
A FOOTSTOOL FOR HIS FEET. For by one offering He has perfected for all time
those who are sanctified.” (Hebrews 10:10-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by the
sanctifying work of the Spirit, to obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with His
blood: May grace and peace be yours in the fullest measure.” (1 Peter 1:2,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The three categories of sanctification for the believer
are Positional, Experiential, and Ultimate Sanctification as illustrated in the
diagram below. Rom. 8:29-30.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become
conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many
brethren; and these whom He predestined, He also called; and these whom He
called, He also justified; and these whom He justified, He also glorified.”
(Romans 8:29-30, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses><img width=450 height=320 id="Picture 1"
src="Sanctification.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Positional Sanctification</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Positional sanctification is God the Holy Spirit placing
the believer into union with Christ at the point of salvation. This is also
called the Baptism of the Spirit. 1 Cor. 1:2; 1 Cor. 1:30; 1 Cor. 6:11; 1 Peter
1:2; Heb. 10:10; Heb. 10:14; Heb. 13:12; 2 Thess. 2:13. See category on <a
href="#_D-Baptism_of_the_1">Baptism of the Holy Spirit</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“To the church of God which is at Corinth, to those who have
been sanctified in Christ Jesus, saints by calling, with all who in every place
call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours:” (1 Corinthians
1:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by the
sanctifying work of the Spirit, to obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with His
blood: May grace and peace be yours in the fullest measure.” (1 Peter 1:2,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For by one offering He has perfected for all time those who
are sanctified.” (Hebrews 10:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But we should always give thanks to God for you, brethren
beloved by the Lord, because God has chosen you from the beginning for
salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and faith in the truth.” (2
Thessalonians 2:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Positional sanctification makes every Church Age believer
in union with Christ positionally higher than angels. Heb. 1:2-4; Heb. 2:8-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“in these last days has spoken to us in His Son, whom He
appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the world. And He is
the radiance of His glory and the exact representation of His nature, and
upholds all things by the word of His power. When He had made purification of
sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, having become as
much better than the angels, as He has inherited a more excellent name than
they.” (Hebrews 1:2-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“YOU HAVE PUT ALL THINGS IN SUBJECTION UNDER HIS FEET.&quot;
For in subjecting all things to him, He left nothing that is not subject to
him. But now we do not yet see all things subjected to him. But we do see Him
who was made for a little while lower than the angels, namely, Jesus, because
of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, so that by the grace of
God He might taste death for everyone.” (Hebrews 2:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Experiential or Progressive Sanctification</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Experiential sanctification refers to the spiritual life
after salvation - being in fellowship with God through the filling of the Holy
Spirit. Experiential sanctification is progressive and emphasizes the Christian
walk or the spiritual life. God’s Word provides the thinking of Jesus Christ so
that when the believer grows spiritually, the thinking of Jesus Christ
accumulates in the right lobe of the believer’s soul as <i>epignosis</i> Bible
doctrine. As the believer matures spiritually, their thinking is progressively
like that of our Lord during His incarnation. 1 Thess. 4:3; Rom. 6; John 17:17;
2 Peter 3:18; Eph. 5:26.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this is the will of God, your sanctification; that is,
that you abstain from sexual immorality;” (1 Thessalonians 4:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth.” (John
17:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory, both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.”
(2 Peter 3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“so that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the
washing of water with the word,” (Ephesians 5:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Experiential sanctification results from consistent
confession of known sins to God the Father using 1 John 1:9 that results in the
filling of the Holy Spirit. The believer consistently taking in and applying
Bible doctrine produces spiritual growth.  Eph. 5:18; 2 Tim. 2:15; 2 Tim.
3:16-17; James 4:8; Heb. 10:25.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but
be filled with the Spirit,” (Ephesians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman
who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth.” (2
Timothy 2:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching,
for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; so that the man of
God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.” (2 Timothy 3:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your
hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded.” (James 4:8,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of
some, but encouraging one another; and all the more as you see the day drawing
near.” (Hebrews 10:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Ultimate Sanctification</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ultimate sanctification refers to every Church Age
believer receives an everlasting resurrection bodies at the Rapture of the
Church. 1 John 3:1-2; 1 Cor. 15:51-57; Phil. 3:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“See how great a love the Father has bestowed on us, that we
would be called children of God; and such we are. For this reason the world
does not know us, because it did not know Him. Beloved, now we are children of
God, and it has not appeared as yet what we will be. We know that when He
appears, we will be like Him, because we will see Him just as He is.” (1 John
3:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Behold, I tell you a mystery; we will not all sleep, but we
will all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last
trumpet; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable,
and we will be changed. For this perishable must put on the imperishable, and
this mortal must put on immortality. But when this perishable will have put on
the imperishable, and this mortal will have put on immortality, then will come
about the saying that is written, &quot;DEATH IS SWALLOWED UP in victory.
&quot;O DEATH, WHERE IS YOUR VICTORY? O DEATH, WHERE IS YOUR STING?&quot; The
sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law; but thanks be to God,
who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.” (1 Corinthians
15:51-57, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“who will transform the body of our humble state into
conformity with the body of His glory, by the exertion of the power that He has
even to subject all things to Himself.” (Philippians 3:21, NASB)</p>
