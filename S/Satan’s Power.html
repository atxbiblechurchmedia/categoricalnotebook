<h2>Satan’s Power </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When God created Lucifer, he held the highest rank of all
angels. He was called the Anointed Cherub. He is the most perfect and beautiful
creature to come from the hand of God. He has a beautiful voice, he is superior
in intelligence to all other creatures, he is beautiful in appearance, he has
an extremely charming personality, he is very persuasiveness, and he is
invisible to humans. Ezek. 28:12. See categories on <a href="#_D-Angels">Angels</a>,
<a href="#_D-Angelic_Conflict,_Satan’s">Angelic Conflict, Satan’s Strategies</a>,
and <a href="#_H-Angelic_Conflict,_Satan’s">Angelic Conflict, Satan’s
Organization of Fallen Angels</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Son of man, take up a lamentation over the king of Tyre
and say to him, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, &quot;You had the seal of perfection,
Full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.” (Ezekiel 28:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>After Satan rebelled against God, he persuaded one-third
of the angels to rebel against God with him. He became known as Satan, the
deceiver, the enemy of God. The angels that rebelled became known as fallen
angels or demons. Satan is now the ruler of this earth and all fallen angels. He
is now lower than the Seraphim who are in command of the elect angels. Luke
4:5-7; John 12:31; John 14:30; John 16:11; 2 Cor. 4:4; Eph. 2:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And he led Him up and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world
in a moment of time. And the devil said to Him, &quot;I will give You all this
domain and its glory; for it has been handed over to me, and I give it to
whomever I wish. &quot;Therefore if You worship before me, it shall all be
Yours.&quot;” (Luke 4:5-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Now judgment is upon this world; now the ruler of this
world will be cast out.” (John 12:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I will not speak much more with you, for the ruler of
the world is coming, and he has nothing in Me;” (John 14:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has
been judged.” (John 16:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“in whose case the god of this world has blinded the minds of
the unbelieving so that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory
of Christ, who is the image of God.” (2 Corinthians 4:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“in which you formerly walked according to the course of this
world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is
now working in the sons of disobedience.” (Ephesians 2:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Even as a fallen angel, Satan can disguise himself as an
angel of light. 2 Cor. 11:11-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do! But what I am
doing I will continue to do, so that I may cut off opportunity from those who
desire an opportunity to be regarded just as we are in the matter about which
they are boasting. For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers,
disguising themselves as apostles of Christ. No wonder, for even Satan
disguises himself as an angel of light.” (2 Corinthians 11:11-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan has the power to rule all unbelievers through demon
possession and demon influence. He is the greatest deceiver of all time. He has
power to blind people’s minds from the Gospel of Jesus Christ with religion.
Religion is seeking a relationship or acceptance of God by man’s means or good
works alone. 2 Cor. 4:3-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who
are perishing, in whose case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the
unbelieving so that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory of
Christ, who is the image of God. For we do not preach ourselves but Christ
Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your bond-servants for Jesus' sake.” (2
Corinthians 4:3-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan has power to shorten the lives of certain members
of the human race with God’s permission. He has the power to remove people from
authority. For example, when someone bucks the Satanic system from a government
standpoint (e.g., opposed to World Council of Churches, National Council of
Churches, Internationalism of both the religious and political ilk - Socialism
and Communism) and they stay in office, it is because God keeps them there,
whether believer or unbeliever. If God allows, Satan would remove them
immediately. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Although Satan’s power and abilities are far superior to
us in every way, Satan’s power is restrained in the Church Age by God the Holy
Spirit. As part of this restraint, God has provided grace principles for the
protection of the human race. These are the Laws of Divine Establishment and
the Divine Institutions. These laws protect our freedom, privacy, property, and
life. Mankind needs this protection because the power of Satan as the ruler of
this world is far greater than any human power. Throughout all dispensations,
mankind can live on the earth because of God's protection through observance of
the Laws of Divine Establishment and the Divine Institutions. See categories on
<a href="#_D-Laws_of_Divine">The Laws of Divine Establishment</a> and the <a
href="#_Divine_Institutions">Divine Institutions</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has delegated His divine power through the Holy
Spirit for the believer to resist the devil. 1 John 4:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“You are from God, little children, and have overcome them;
because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world.” (1 John 4:4,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Satan is a Murderer</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan has sinned from the beginning and has been a
murderer from the beginning. Satan is the origin of murder and violence in the
human race. Satan always opposes God and God's grace. John 8:44; 1 John 3:8. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the
desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not
stand in the truth because there is no truth in him. Whenever he speaks a lie,
he speaks from his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies.” (John
8:44, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“the one who practices sin is of the devil; for the devil has
sinned from the beginning. The Son of God appeared for this purpose, to destroy
the works of the devil.” (1 John 3:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If allowed by God, Satan has the power of death. Heb.
2:14-15 </p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood, He
Himself likewise also partook of the same, that through death He might render
powerless him who had the power of death, that is, the devil, and might free
those who through fear of death were subject to slavery all their lives.”
(Hebrews 2:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan was allowed by God to kill Job’s children. Job 1:12;
Job 1:18-19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD said to Satan, &quot;Behold, all that he has is
in your power, only do not put forth your hand on him.&quot; So Satan departed
from the presence of the LORD.” (Job 1:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses> “While he was still speaking, another also came and said,
&quot;Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their
oldest brother's house, and behold, a great wind came from across the
wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young
people and they died, and I alone have escaped to tell you.&quot;” (Job
1:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan motivated Cain to murder Abel in the first
religious murder. Many have died since, with the worst wars being religious
wars. 1 John 3:12; John 8:44. </p>

<p class=Verses>“not as Cain, who was of the evil one and slew his brother. And
for what reason did he slay him? Because his deeds were evil, and his brother's
were righteous.” (1 John 3:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the
desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not
stand in the truth because there is no truth in him. Whenever he speaks a lie,
he speaks from his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies.” (John
8:44, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan had been given charge of administering the sin unto
death to the incestuous Corinthian believer in 1 Corinthians 5:5.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“I have decided to deliver such a one to Satan for the
destruction of his flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the
Lord Jesus.” (1 Corinthians 5:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Satan Has the Power to Cause Disease and to Heal That
Disease</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are three general categories of illness; 1)
physiological illnesses such as infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases, and
other diseases such as cancer, etc., 2) psychosomatic illnesses where the mental
state causes or influences a physical illness, and 3) demon induced illness
caused by demon possession. Demon induced illness can mimic some of the
physiological and psychosomatic illnesses or their symptoms.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan was permitted by God to buffet Paul with a “thorn
in the flesh.” 2 Cor. 12:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, for
this reason, to keep me from exalting myself, there was given me a thorn in the
flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me—to keep me from exalting myself!” (2
Corinthians 12:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan was responsible for Job’s illness. Job’s illness and
loss of his family and wealth was permitted by God since Job was a believer and
was meant to test his spiritual maturity under severe testing. Job 2:6-8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So the LORD said to Satan, &quot;Behold, he is in your power,
only spare his life.&quot; Then Satan went out from the presence of the LORD
and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot to the crown of his
head. And he took a potsherd to scrape himself while he was sitting among the
ashes.” (Job 2:6-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan uses demons to produce disease in unbelievers by
demon possession. Acts 10:38. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You know of Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed Him with
the Holy Spirit and with power, and how He went about doing good and healing
all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him.” (Acts 10:38, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 13:10-17, the cause of this woman’s disease was
demon possession. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath.
And there was a woman who for eighteen years had had a sickness caused by a
spirit; and she was bent double, and could not straighten up at all. When Jesus
saw her, He called her over and said to her, &quot;Woman, you are freed from
your sickness.&quot; And He laid His hands on her; and immediately she was made
erect again and began glorifying God. But the synagogue official, indignant
because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, began saying to the crowd in response,
&quot;There are six days in which work should be done; so come during them and
get healed, and not on the Sabbath day.&quot; But the Lord answered him and
said, &quot;You hypocrites, does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or
his donkey from the stall and lead him away to water him? &quot;And this woman,
a daughter of Abraham as she is, whom Satan has bound for eighteen long years,
should she not have been released from this bond on the Sabbath day?&quot; As
He said this, all His opponents were being humiliated; and the entire crowd was
rejoicing over all the glorious things being done by Him.” (Luke 13:10-17,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ healed in cases where demon possession caused
the illness by casting out the demon involved. Jesus Christ also healed in
cases where demon possession did not cause the illness. They were just cast out
with no mention of healing. Matt. 10:1; Mark 1:32-34; Mark 6:13; Acts 8:7; Acts
19:12. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Jesus summoned His twelve disciples and gave them authority
over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every kind of disease and
every kind of sickness.” (Matthew 10:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“When evening came, after the sun had set, they began bringing
to Him all who were ill and those who were demon-possessed. And the whole city
had gathered at the door. And He healed many who were ill with various
diseases, and cast out many demons; and He was not permitting the demons to
speak, because they knew who He was.” (Mark 1:32-34, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And they were casting out many demons and were anointing with
oil many sick people and healing them.” (Mark 6:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For in the case of many who had unclean spirits, they were
coming out of them shouting with a loud voice; and many who had been paralyzed
and lame were healed.” (Acts 8:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“so that handkerchiefs or aprons were even carried from his
body to the sick, and the diseases left them and the evil spirits went out.”
(Acts 19:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan uses demon possession to cause deafness, dumbness,
and paralysis. Matt. 9:32-33; Matt. 12:22; Mark 5:5-8; Mark 9:17-18. </p>

<p class=Verses>“As they were going out, a mute, demon-possessed man was
brought to Him. After the demon was cast out, the mute man spoke; and the
crowds were amazed, and were saying, &quot;Nothing like this has ever been seen
in Israel.&quot;” (Matthew 9:32-33, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute was brought
to Jesus, and He healed him, so that the mute man spoke and saw.” (Matthew
12:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Constantly, night and day, he was screaming among the tombs
and in the mountains, and gashing himself with stones. Seeing Jesus from a
distance, he ran up and bowed down before Him; and shouting with a loud voice,
he said, &quot;What business do we have with each other, Jesus, Son of the Most
High God? I implore You by God, do not torment me!&quot; For He had been saying
to him, &quot;Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!&quot;” (Mark 5:5-8,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And one of the crowd answered Him, &quot;Teacher, I brought
You my son, possessed with a spirit which makes him mute; and whenever it
seizes him, it slams him to the ground and he foams at the mouth, and grinds
his teeth and stiffens out. I told Your disciples to cast it out, and they
could not do it.&quot;” (Mark 9:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Miraculous healing can be caused by Satan in cases of
demon possession. Faith-healers in cooperation with the devil heal in
connection with demon-induced illness where the demon comes out and the illness
appears to be healed. Satan is in the healing ministry. 2 Thess. 2:9. </p>

<p class=Verses>“that is, the one whose coming is in accord with the activity
of Satan, with all power and signs and false wonders,” (2 Thessalonians 2:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 7:21-23, the casting out of demons has been
identified with healing. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Not everyone who says to Me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter
the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father who is in heaven
will enter. &quot;Many will say to Me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not
prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name
perform many miracles?' &quot;And then I will declare to them, 'I never knew
you; DEPART FROM ME, YOU WHO PRACTICE LAWLESSNESS.'” (Matthew 7:21-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Revelation 13:3 and Revelation 13:12 the Beast of the
Tribulation will heal. See category on <a href="#_D-The_Two_Beasts_1">The Two
Beasts of the Tribulation</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I saw one of his heads as if it had been slain, and his fatal
wound was healed. And the whole earth was amazed and followed after the beast;”
(Revelation 13:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He exercises all the authority of the first beast in his
presence. And he makes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first
beast, whose fatal wound was healed.” (Revelation 13:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan is able to heal people by his power. Matthew
7:21-23 describes a very prevalent situation today in the large “mass healing”
meetings. The use of “Lord, Lord” in Matthew 7:21 refers to the constant use of
the name of Jesus Christ in apostate meetings of the healing and tongues
variety. “Many” are duped into believing Satan’s power is God’s power. They
prophecy and cast out demons and perform many miracles in the name of Jesus
Christ. This includes prophecies, healings, tongues and other rank apostacy of
this day. “I never knew you” means they are unbelievers. “You who practice
lawlessness” means that their prophecies, casting out demons and miracles are
called iniquity or sin. God’s power is not sin, therefore this power by which
they operate is Satan’s power.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For example, an unsaved demon-possessed faith-healer will
be very nice, very well-dressed, very well-versed in using the name of Jesus
Christ repeatedly and doing everything in the name of Jesus. Note the use of
“in Your name” in Matthew 7:22.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He will use emotion, he will take up a huge offering, and
he will have an empirical or sensory approach. The people who come up to be
healed may have demon-induced illness or they may not. The demon possessed
individual cooperates with the individual with demon-induced illness. When he
shouts “heal” and the demon comes out of the victim and the demon-induced
illness is no more. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The whole crowd of simple and stupid believers or
non-believers are watching and shouting “Praise God” etc. If the faith healing
is not demon possessed, and the victim is not demon possessed, it is purely
psychosomatic or an emotionally charged atmosphere which makes the person think
they have faith and think they are healed. In 2 Thessalonians 2:9, “with the
activity of Satan, with all power and signs and false wonders” refers to this
as Satanic power that will occur in the Tribulation. Its mystery of iniquity is
already at work in the Church Age.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God's Use of Satan to Discipline Some Believers</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 22:31-32, Peter is the example of a believer out
of fellowship that sometimes needed outward pressure produced by Satan to get
them back in line.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has demanded permission to
sift you like wheat; but I have prayed for you, that your faith may not fail;
and you, when once you have turned again, strengthen your brothers.&quot;”
(Luke 22:31-32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sometimes, for believers in continual reversionism for a
good length of time, God may allow Satan to administer the sin unto death. 1
Cor. 5:5. </p>

<p class=Verses>“I have decided to deliver such a one to Satan for the
destruction of his flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the
Lord Jesus.” (1 Corinthians 5:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Concerning loud-mouthed, critical, and bitter believers
such as Hymenaeus and Alexander, God may deliver the believer to Satan for
punishment. 1 Tim. 1:19-20. </p>

<p class=Verses>“keeping faith and a good conscience, which some have rejected
and suffered shipwreck in regard to their faith. Among these are Hymenaeus and
Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan, so that they will be taught not to
blaspheme.” (1 Timothy 1:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan may also be an instrument in disciplining ministers
and deacons. Being on church boards has ruined many a man. You will get much
the same pressure that the pastor has as a deacon. A deacon is an assistant to
the pastor. 1 Tim. 3:6-7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and not a new convert, so that he will not become conceited
and fall into the condemnation incurred by the devil. And he must have a good
reputation with those outside the church, so that he will not fall into
reproach and the snare of the devil.” (1 Timothy 3:6-7, NASB)</p>
