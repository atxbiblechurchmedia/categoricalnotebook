<h2><a name="_D-Spiritual_Gifts,_Temporary"></a>Spiritual Gifts, Temporary </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Temporary spiritual gifts were necessary to get the
Church started without a completed Canon of Scripture. Temporary spiritual
gifts functioned in place of the yet-to-be completed written New Testament
Canon of Scripture. Most were spectacular in order to draw attention to the
message given by the person with the gift. They were very evident in a public
way, so that people would see how unusual and supernatural they were and so
they could draw a crowd.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Temporary spiritual gifts functioned only during the Pre-Canon
period of the Church Age from 30 to 96 AD. The permanent spiritual gifts
function during both the Pre-Canon period of the Church Age and through the
entire Post-Canon period of the Church Age. After 96 A.D., all of the temporary
spiritual gifts had ceased to function because their purpose had been fulfilled
according to the Word of God. Temporary spiritual gifts were removed by God
between 70 to 96 AD while the Canon was being circulated throughout the Roman
world. None of the temporary gifts function legitimately today. For those that claim
that temporary spiritual gifts still function, they are not from God – they are
a satanic operation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The importance of the temporary spiritual gifts was based
on the authority and responsibility given to the communicator with the gift and
their effect on the building up and edification of believers in the Body of
Christ. Below is a list of the temporary spiritual gifts. The gifts of
apostleship and prophesy are listed first as they are the primary communication
gifts for the Pre-Canon period of the Church Age. They came with great
responsibility and significant effect on the building up of the Body of Christ.
1 Cor. 12:8-10; 1 Cor. 12:28.</p>

Spirits </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For to one is given the word of wisdom through the
Spirit, and to another the word of knowledge according to the same Spirit; to
another faith by the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healing by the one
Spirit, and to another the effecting of miracles, and to another prophecy, and
to another the distinguishing of spirits, to another various kinds of tongues,
and to another the interpretation of tongues.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 12:8-10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And God has appointed in the church, first apostles,
second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps,
administrations, various kinds of tongues.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 12:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All of the spiritual gifts are the work of the Holy
Spirit and that He gives them just as He sovereignly determines. We also see
spiritual gifts portrayed as analogous to the human body. Although the body is
one unit, it is made up of many parts that each have a unique, but important
function. This is how it is with the Body of Christ which has many believers
with different spiritual gifts and different spiritual lives all functioning to
improve and expand the Body of Christ. 1 Cor. 12:11-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But one and the same Spirit works all these things,
distributing to each one individually just as He wills. For even as the body is
one and yet has many members, and all the members of the body, though they are
many, are one body, so also is Christ. For by one Spirit we were all baptized
into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all
made to drink of one Spirit.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 12:11-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Apostleship</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The gift of Apostleship had the highest authority ever
delegated by God in the Church Age. Many of those given this gift by the Holy
Spirit on the Day of Pentecost are the authors of the New Testament epistles who
taught and wrote the mystery doctrines that were not revealed in the Old
Testament Scripture. All writers of the New Testament were either apostles or
someone closely associated with an apostle such as Mark and Luke. These
apostles wrote in the New Testament prophecy details of the future dispensations
which will follow the Church Age, both the Tribulation and the Millennium. Rom.
16:25; 1 Cor. 12:28; Eph. 4:11; 1 Cor. 12:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now to Him who is able to establish you according to my
gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the
mystery which has been kept secret for long ages past,&quot;  (Romans 16:25,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And God has appointed in the church, first apostles,
second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps,
administrations, various kinds of tongues.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 12:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and
some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers,&quot;  (Ephesians 4:11,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But one and the same Spirit works all these things,
distributing to each one individually just as He wills.&quot;  (1 Corinthians
12:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The word “apostle” is derived from the Attic Greek word <span
lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>πο</span>́<span lang=EL>στολος</span> (apostolos)
and means admiral, supreme commander, or one who has the highest rank. The
spiritual gift of apostleship was designed for two purposes. One was the
formation of the Canon of Scripture, the New Testament. The other purpose was
leadership in the Pre-Canon period of the Church Age. This leadership involved
training of pastors, establishing local churches, and teaching the mystery
doctrines of the Church Age until the Canon was completed. See category on <a
href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/A/Apostleship%2C%20Spiritual%20Gift.html">Apostleship, Spiritual Gift</a>. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Prophecy</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The gift of Prophecy enabled the possessor of the gift to
foretell events pertaining to the Church Age not in the Canon of Scripture at
the time that the gift of prophecy was given. Such prophecies included the
Rapture, the Tribulation, the Second Advent, the Millennium and eternity.
Although there was mention of the Second Advent, the Tribulation and the
Eternal State in the Old Testament, there was information given to New
Testament prophets not yet in the Canon of Scripture. That information was
given under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and was included in the New
Testament Canon.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This was a temporary spiritual gift. The gift of prophecy
faded out of existence. The partial, in the Pre-Canon period, were the
temporary spiritual gifts including prophecy, which would be done away with
once the written Canon of Scripture (the perfect) was completed and circulated
in 96-100 A.D. 1 Cor.13:8-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Love never fails; but if there are gifts of prophecy,
they will be done away; if there are tongues, they will cease; if there is
knowledge, it will be done away. For we know in part and we prophesy in part;
but when the perfect comes, the partial will be done away.&quot;  (1
Corinthians 13:8-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The gift of prophecy included foretelling which was
predicting future events as well as forthtelling, which is simply giving the
message from the Lord. Today, the pastor-teacher is the minister of the local
church and forthtells the message from the Word of God. It applies to anyone
who is giving forth a message from the Lord. For instance, whenever you give
the Gospel, you are forthtelling. Forthtelling is having divine viewpoint from
the Word of God in your soul and sharing it with someone else. When you give
forth a message or a viewpoint or a principle from the Word of God, you are
forthtelling. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/P/Prophecy%2C%20Spiritual%20Gift.html">Prophecy,
Spiritual Gift</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Miracles</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The temporary spiritual gift of Miracles was the ability
to perform a miracle at will. This was the sign that he was from God. Faith of
the person who had the gift of performing miracles was not required. It didn't
depend on how strong or weak his personal faith was. It depended upon God the
Holy Spirit to get the job done. God the Holy Spirit performed the miracles
through the one who had the gift of miracles. 1 Cor. 12:28. See category on <a
href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/M/Miracles%2C%20Spiritual%20Gift.html">Miracles, Spiritual Gift.</a></p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And God has appointed in the church, first apostles,
second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps,
administrations, various kinds of tongues.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 12:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Healing</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The temporary spiritual gift of Healing was the ability
to heal at will. The purpose of the gift of healing was not just to alleviate
human suffering. It was their credentials in establishing their authority of
the Word of God and the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The apostles and many of their
close associates had the gift of healing. It was the ability to heal people
with all kinds of diseases to provide a highly visible platform of recognition
of their authority from God and communication of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 1
Cor. 12:9. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/H/Healing%2C%20Spiritual%20Gift.html">Healing,
Spiritual Gift.</a></p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;to another faith by the same Spirit, and to another gifts
of healing by the one Spirit,&quot;  (1 Corinthians 12:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Tongues</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The spiritual gift of Tongues was the ability of a person
to speak eloquently in a language without ever having learned that language. When
speaking in tongues, there was a great flow of words in the mind of the
speaker, but the vocabulary that came from their mouth was in a language they
had never learned to speak. The content of the gift of tongues was always the
Gospel. This gift was the ability to share the Gospel in a foreign language. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Tongues was not emotional gibberish or drunken speech or
an angelic language. It was a spiritual gift that functioned only under certain
circumstances and involved the Holy Spirit controlling the vocal cords so that
the speaker uttered a foreign language not previously known by the
communicator, but known to some unbeliever nearby who was listening. The use of
the gift was a warning to the Jews of the impending fifth cycle of discipline.
The fifth cycle of discipline for Israel transpired in 70 AD with the destruction
of Jerusalem. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/T/Tongues%2C%20Spiritual%20Gift.html">Tongues,
Spiritual Gift</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Interpretation of Tongues</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The temporary spiritual gift of the Interpretation or Translation
of Tongues was the ability to translate accurately what was being said to the
foreign unbelievers present, making sure that the one giving the message in a
foreign tongue was giving accurate Gospel information. The gift of tongues
never functioned without the gift of interpretation of tongues also
functioning. This was not simply being well educated in numerous languages. The
ones who had this gift would not even know the languages that they were
translating! Those that had the gift of giving the Gospel to an unbeliever in their
own language (tongues), a language they themselves did not understand, never
had the gift of interpretation of tongues. This was so that people in the
congregation would believe in the accuracy of the message and that those
speaking in foreign languages were not just cranking out gibberish. God had a
very special way to make sure that everything was done in decency and order. 1
Cor. 12:10; 1 Cor. 12:30. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/I/Interpretation%20of%20Tongues%2C%20Spiritual%20Gift.html">Interpretation
of Tongues, Spiritual Gift</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and to another the effecting of miracles, and to another
prophecy, and to another the distinguishing of spirits, to another various
kinds of tongues, and to another the interpretation of tongues.&quot;  (1
Corinthians 12:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;All do not have gifts of healings, do they? All do not
speak with tongues, do they? All do not interpret, do they?&quot;  (1
Corinthians 12:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Knowledge</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The temporary spiritual gift of Knowledge was knowing
what would be included in the completed Canon of Scripture while the New
Testament Scripture had not yet been written. This gift functioned only prior
to the completion of the Canon of Scripture in 96 AD. For example, the
doctrines of Positional Truth and the Filling of the Holy Spirit, etc., were
taught before all the Epistles were written.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>With this temporary gift, they had instant <i>epignosis</i>
knowledge of mystery Church Age doctrine. This was a spiritual gift whereby you
knew a Church Age doctrine without studying it, for there was as yet no New
Testament Canon in writing to study. This knowledge was provided directly by
God the Holy Spirit who inserted previously unknown doctrinal information into
a person’s right lobe as <i>epignosis</i>. In other words, the gift of
knowledge functioned totally apart from the function of the grace apparatus for
perception. 1 Cor 12:8. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/KL/Knowledge%2C%20Spiritual%20Gift.html">Knowledge,
Spiritual Gift</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For to one is given the word of wisdom through the
Spirit, and to another the word of knowledge according to the same
Spirit;&quot;  (1 Corinthians 12:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Word of Wisdom</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The temporary spiritual gift of the Word of Wisdom accompanied
the temporary spiritual gift of Knowledge and was the ability to explain and
apply the mystery doctrine of the Church Age taught by the gift of Knowledge.
Some taught the mystery doctrines while others taught the application of those
doctrines. Today, divine wisdom comes to any growing believer based on their
consistent intake and application of Bible doctrine. 1 Cor. 12:8.  See category
on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/WXYZ/Word%20of%20Wisdom%2C%20Spiritual%20Gift.html">Word of Wisdom, Spiritual Gift</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For to one is given the word of wisdom through the
Spirit, and to another the word of knowledge according to the same
Spirit;&quot;  (1 Corinthians 12:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Discerning Spirits</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The temporary spiritual gift of Discerning Spirits was
the gift of detecting heresy in the early church or the gift of distinguishing
true from false doctrine and to recognize false teachers. If the message was
not correct, the one with the gift would say the message was not correct to
those near him. They would tell others that they should not listen to what was
being said. With the completion of the Canon of Scripture in 96 AD, this gift
was no longer necessary, since the New Testament contains true doctrine and
thereby exposes false doctrine. 1 Cor 12:10. See category on <a
href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/D/Discerning%20Spirits%2C%20Spiritual%20Gift.html">Discerning Spirits, Spiritual Gift</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and to another the effecting of miracles, and to another
prophecy, and to another the distinguishing of spirits, to another various
kinds of tongues, and to another the interpretation of tongues.&quot;  (1
Corinthians 12:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Cessation of Temporary Spiritual Gifts</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The temporary spiritual gifts functioned only during the
Pre-Canon period, from approximately 30 to 100 AD. Most of them were highly
supernatural and very spectacular during that time. These gifts were necessary
to get the Church started without a completed Bible. These temporary gifts
ceased in function because their purpose was completed as stated in 1
Corinthians 13:8. In contrast, the permanent spiritual gifts continued to function
throughout the Post-Canon period of the Church Age, right down to the Rapture
or Exit Resurrection of the Church.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Love never fails; but if there are gifts of prophecy,
they will be done away; if there are tongues, they will cease; if there is
knowledge, it will be done away.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 13:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 13:8, “Love” refers to the filling of
the Holy Spirit producing unconditional love in the believer. The verb “never
fails” is the present active indicative of <span lang=EL>πίπτω</span> (piptō)
and means it never comes to a stop, it never is destroyed or collapses. The
thing that really counts is the Spirit-controlled life, not the gift of
tongues. This verse sets up a contrast where the filling of the Holy Spirit
remains the same through the Church Age, but the temporary gifts will cease. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The phrase “gifts of prophecy, they will be done away” is
the future passive indicative of <span lang=EL>καταργέω</span> (katargeō) and
means to cause to put an end to, to do away with, to annul, to abolish. They
will fade out of the picture and finally be abolished. Where there are
prophecies, they will be done away or they will fade out. This is the part
(Pre-canon) moving toward the whole (completed Canon). When the Canon of
Scripture was completed, there would be no further need for prophecy. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The same is mentioned for tongues. “They will cease” is
the future middle indicative of <span lang=EL>παύω</span> (pauō) and means to
stop, to cease at a set time. The temporary gift of tongues ceased at 70 AD
after 40 years. Its purpose was completed. These miraculous gifts were being
disseminated in Jerusalem to evangelize the Jews to fulfill the prophecy of
tongues.  The gift of tongues didn’t fade out, but ceased right at a definite
time. The gift of tongues was stilled in 70 AD. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 Corinthians 13:9 uses the phrase “in part” is <span
lang=EL>μέρος</span> (meros) and means one of the constituent parts of a whole.
The whole refers to the completed written canon of Scripture. At the time this
was written, the New Testament was not yet complete, thus the use of “in part.”</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For we know in part and we prophesy in part;&quot;  (1
Corinthians 13:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 13:10, “the perfect” refers to the
completed written canon of Scripture. The “partial” refers to the written Bible
at the time Paul wrote 1 Corinthians. The New Testament containing the mystery
doctrines of the Church Age was not yet completed and circulated. In comparing
the Greek construction here with James 1:25, they both use <span lang=EL>τέλειος</span>
(teleios) and means that which is perfect, wanting nothing necessary to
completeness.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;but when the perfect comes, the partial will be done
away.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 13:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But one who looks intently at the perfect law, the law of
liberty, and abides by it, not having become a forgetful hearer but an
effectual doer, this man will be blessed in what he does.&quot;  (James 1:25,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The gift of knowledge also faded out. In 1 Corinthians
13:8, “Knowledge, it will be done away” is the future passive indicative of <span
lang=EL>καταργέω</span> (katargeō) and means to cause to put an end to, do
away with, to annul, to abolish. As more books were added to the Canon, the
more the temporary gifts of prophecy and knowledge faded. The King James says
they vanished. This is a good description. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><a name="_The_Cessation_of_1"></a>The gift of healing was
also withdrawn. For example, Paul’s gift of healing was withdrawn once his
authority was established among the local churches. An illustration of this is
Timothy's illness. Paul told him to take a little wine for his stomach's sake
in 1 Timothy 5:23. Paul couldn't heal this problem, so he told Timothy to drink
a little wine. Paul's authority in the local churches was established and his
gift of healing was taken away. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;No longer drink water exclusively, but use a little wine
for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments.&quot;  (1 Timothy
5:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Understand that God still heals today, but the gift of
healing does not function today. Healing is the sovereign decision of the Lord.
God can heal medically and He can heal divinely. However, there is another
category of healing that comes directly from Satan. Satan can and does induce
illnesses and also induces cures from demonism. It’s clear that our Lord healed
to establish His authority so that the Jews would know He was the Messiah of
God and the Savior of the world. The apostle's gift of healing was to establish
their authority as apostles and representatives of the Lord Jesus Christ, the
Messiah. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The temporary spiritual gifts functioned in place of the
completed Canon. This is the partial moving toward the whole. The phrase “For
we know in part” refers to the Pre-Canon period. The “perfect” is the completed
Canon of Scripture because in the Greek, it is in the neuter gender, not the
masculine gender which would refer to Jesus Christ. It refers to the Canon.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Holy Spirit withdrew these temporary gifts in the
Post-canon period to focus our attention on the written Word of God. Everything
we need is in the written Canon of Scripture. God the Holy Spirit reminds us in
1 Corinthians 13:10 that we have something more powerful and more important
now. We have the completed Canon of Scripture - the perfect Word of God.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;but when the perfect comes, the partial will be done
away.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 13:10, NASB)</p>
