<h2><a name="_Spirituality_2"></a><a name="_The_Biblical_Concept_1"></a><a
name="_D-Spirituality"></a>Spirituality</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spirituality gets its title from the third person of the
Trinity – God the Holy Spirit. An understanding of spiritual growth is
necessary for the understanding of spirituality. A distinction must be made in
the Bible between spirituality and spiritual growth or spiritual maturity.
Maturity is a result of spiritual growth and is often mistaken for
spirituality.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You can be a spiritual babe and can be either spiritual
or carnal. An spiritual adolescent can be either spiritual or carnal. A spiritually
mature believer can be either spiritual or carnal. The issue of spirituality is
that at any point your soul is either controlled by the Holy Spirit or
controlled by your old sin nature. The issue is spiritual growth or spiritual
retrogression, depending on the <i>epignosis</i> (full knowledge) Bible
doctrine in the right lobe of your soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What makes a person spiritual? Is it an experience which
some Christians achieve to a greater degree than others? Is it a stimulating
feeling within that produces an ecstatic reaction? Should we try to imitate the
experience of another great believer in order to become spiritual? What does
the Bible teach regarding spirituality?</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spirituality is open to all believers, just as salvation
is open to all humanity. Spirituality is not an elusive and mysterious
experience that some can have which will set them apart from other believers.
Spirituality in the Church Age is a relationship with God the Holy Spirit.
Christianity is a relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ. We are Christians
because of our relationship with Jesus Christ. We are spiritual because we are
filled with the Holy Spirit and is in control of our lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>While spiritual growth is by degrees, being spiritual or
being carnal are absolutes. A believer is 100% spiritual if their soul is being
controlled by the Holy Spirit. There are no degrees of spirituality. A believer
is 100% carnal if their soul is being controlled by the old sin nature. The
babe believer can be controlled by the Holy Spirit. A growing believer and be
controlled by the Holy Spirit. The mature believer and be controlled by the
Holy Spirit. A believer is spiritual if they are being controlled by the Holy
Spirit regardless of the level of spiritual growth. While salvation is being
rightly related to Christ, spirituality is being rightly related to the Holy
Spirit, that is, being controlled by Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One is either in fellowship or out. Spiritual or carnal.
The believer is either walking in the light or walking in darkness. The
believer is either walking in the Spirit or walking by means of their old sin
nature. When a believer gets out of fellowship, they are carnal. To get back
into fellowship, the believer needs to use 1 John 1:9, to confess their known
sins to God the Father and keep on moving.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&quot;  (1 John
1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer can never get out of their union with Jesus
Christ, their eternal relationship, but a believer can get out of fellowship.
When the believer decides to sin whether they realize it or not, they lose the
filling of the Holy Spirit and are immediately in a state of carnality. The
believer’s soul can’t be controlled by the Holy Spirit and the old sin nature
at the same time. These are absolutes. When they confess sin biblically, the
filling of the Holy Spirit is restored per 1 John 1:9 and they are again in
fellowship with God. Eph. 5:14-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For this reason it says, &quot;Awake, sleeper, And arise
from the dead, And Christ will shine on you.&quot; Therefore be careful how you
walk, not as unwise men but as wise, making the most of your time, because the
days are evil. So then do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the
Lord is. And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but be filled
with the Spirit,&quot;  (Ephesians 5:14-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Spirituality and Carnality are Absolutes</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spirituality and carnality are mutually exclusive and
therefore absolutes. The believer has an eternal positional relationship with
God in Jesus Christ. The believer also has an experiential relationship with
God in time called fellowship. The believer’s soul is either completely
controlled by the Holy Spirit and in a state of spirituality or when the
believer decides to sin their soul is immediately controlled by the old sin
nature and out of fellowship and becomes carnal. In carnality, the believer’s
soul is controlled by their old sin nature and allows them to give in to
temptation to sin, produce human good, and produce evil. Rom. 8:2; Gal. 5:9; Rom.
8:6; 1 Cor. 3:1-3; 1 John 1:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set
you free from the law of sin and of death.&quot;  (Romans 8:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“A little leaven leavens the whole lump of dough.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Galatians
5:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on
the Spirit is life and peace,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 8:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual men,
but as to men of flesh, as to infants in Christ. I gave you milk to drink, not
solid food; for you were not yet able to receive it. Indeed, even now you are
not yet able, for you are still fleshly. For since there is jealousy and strife
among you, are you not fleshly, and are you not walking like mere men?”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Corinthians 3:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the
darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 John 1:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer has the indwelling God the Holy Spirit and
in principle, should produce the character of Christ in their spiritual life.
In practice, because of free will, believers can either walk in the light in
fellowship (filled with the Holy Spirit) or in the darkness out of fellowship
(controlled by the old sin nature). Volition is the control switch and allows
the negative believer to come under the control of the old sin nature and
produce sin and dead works or human good. Volition also allows the positive
believer to resist the temptation of the old sin nature and remain in a state
of spirituality where the Holy Spirit controls the soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The following two lists show biblical vocabulary
indicating the absolute status of spirituality versus carnality.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b><u>Spirituality</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Filled with the Holy Spirit</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>In fellowship</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Walking in the Spirit </i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Walking in the light </i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Soul controlled by the Holy Spirit</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Produces divine good </i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>The new man</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b><u>Carnality </span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Not filled with the Holy Spirit </i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Out of fellowship</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Walking in the flesh (energy)</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Walking in darkness</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Soul controlled by the old sin
nature</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Produces human good</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>The old man</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is not the author of sin. God does not solicit to
sin. Sin is incompatible with God's perfect and absolute attributes. God cannot
originate, condone, or sponsor sin. What the old sin nature promotes always
leads to sin which results in carnality.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Confession of sin to God the Father via 1 John 1:9 takes
control from the old sin nature and gives control to the Holy Spirit. The Holy
Spirit cannot control the soul if there is unconfessed sin as the Holy Spirit
is perfect God. God is absolute righteousness (+R) and cannot fellowship with
anything less than perfect righteousness. Therefore, spirituality cannot
fellowship with carnality.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To be born again of God in the dispensation of the Church
Age means living in union with Christ, indwelt by the deity of Jesus Christ,
the Holy Spirit, and God the Father. Through the filling of the Holy Spirit,
the Holy Spirit produces the character of Christ in the believer, and in this
status of spirituality, it is impossible to sin. When the believer exercises
their free will to sin, the believer’s soul instantly loses the Holy Spirit’s
control and the old sin nature takes over.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has provided the only means to regain a state of
spirituality. The believer has both the indwelling Holy Spirit and the old sin
nature, hence we have the inner struggle. Rom. 5:16-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The gift is not like that which came through the one who
sinned; for on the one hand the judgment arose from one transgression resulting
in condemnation, but on the other hand the free gift arose from many
transgressions resulting in justification. For if by the transgression of the
one, death reigned through the one, much more those who receive the abundance
of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One,
Jesus Christ.” (Romans 5:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Confession or naming of known sins to God the Father per
1 John 1:9 provides perfect cleansing of the soul from all unrighteousness giving
the believer experiential righteousness, making spirituality an absolute. 1
John 3:3; Rom. 8:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“And everyone who has this hope fixed on Him purifies himself,
just as He is pure.” (1 John 3:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you
free from the law of sin and of death.” (Romans 8:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The spiritual believer is the subject of 1 John 3:9. The “seed”
refers to the God the Holy Spirit and God cannot be in the presence of sin.
When the Holy Spirit controls the life, the believer cannot sin.</p>

<p class=Verses>“No one who is born of God practices sin, because His seed
abides in him; and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.” (1 John 3:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>An Illustration of Spirituality vs. Carnality - Light
vs. Darkness </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 John 1:5-7, an illustration of light and darkness is
used to depict the absolutes of spirituality and carnality. God is Light. The
believer filled with the Holy Spirit and in a state of spirituality is “walking
in the Light.” In fellowship, through the filling of the Holy Spirit and the
application of the grace apparatus for perception, they can erect an
edification structure in the soul which reflects the glory of God. In 1 John
1:5, “no darkness at all” means God’s perfect essence can have no contact with
sin, cannot condone sin, and cannot promote sin. God's perfect righteousness
can only condemn sin and His perfect justice can only judge sin. Psalms 18:30.</p>

<p class=Verses>“This is the message we have heard from Him and announce to
you, that God is Light, and in Him there is no darkness at all. If we say that
we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not
practice the truth; but if we walk in the Light as He Himself is in the Light,
we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us
from all sin.” (1 John 1:5-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“As for God, His way is blameless; The word of the LORD is
tried; He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him.” (Psalms 18:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 3:1-3, “spiritual men” refers to
believers filled with the Holy Spirit or in an absolute state of spirituality.
The believer out of fellowship with their soul controlled by the old sin nature
is called carnal. The believer out of fellowship is walking in darkness,
reflecting the control of the old sin nature, and behaving just like an
unbeliever. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual men,
but as to men of flesh, as to infants in Christ. I gave you milk to drink, not
solid food; for you were not yet able to receive it. Indeed, even now you are
not yet able, for you are still fleshly. For since there is jealousy and strife
among you, are you not fleshly, and are you not walking like mere men?” (1
Corinthians 3:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Positionally, every Church Age believer is in union with
Christ, in union with “the Light.” Experientially, the believer walks “in the
Light” only when they are filled with the Holy Spirit. 1 Cor. 12:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether
Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one
Spirit.” (1 Corinthians 12:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Light and darkness are mutually exclusive. So are
spirituality and carnality. The believer then cannot have fellowship with God
when their old sin nature controls their soul. Even though positionally the
believer has fellowship with God forever, temporal fellowship depends upon
confession of sin using 1 John 1:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Negative volition resulting in sin gets you out from
under the control of the Holy Spirit. Confession of sin biblically gets you
back under the control of the Holy Spirit. Because of our position “in union
with the Light” we are told to “walk in the Light.” When a believer is out of
fellowship they are called a weak believer. “Walking in darkness” is
emphasizing an ignorance of the Word.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Commands Regarding Spirituality</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are two negative commands and one positive command
regarding spirituality. The first command is to “Do not grieve the Holy Spirit.”
Grieving the Holy Spirit is caused by any sin in the life of the believer which
involves a moral or ethical issue. Grieving the Holy Spirit is producing sins
from your area of weakness in the old sin nature, such as immorality, sins of
the tongue, and mental attitude sins. These get the believer out of fellowship.
Eph. 4:30.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed
for the day of redemption.” (Ephesians 4:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The second command is “Do not quench the Spirit.” Quenching
the Holy Spirit is disobedience to God’s Word that doesn’t involve a moral or
ethical issue. It is producing human good from the area of strength in the old
sin nature. Human good soothes your conscience and thus you fail to confess
your sins to God the Father per 1 John 1:9. You then fail to get out of
carnality and quench the Holy Spirit by keep Him from controlling your life. 1
Thess. 5:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“Do not quench the Spirit;” (1 Thessalonians 5:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The two negative commands show that we can do something not
to be spiritual! The third command shows that we can do nothing to be spiritual!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The third command is to “be filled with the Spirit.” The
present tense means “to keep on being filled” indicating that we are not always
filled. The Holy Spirit is God and God cannot control when there is sin in the
life. So to be controlled by God the Holy Spirit, we must get into fellowship
by use of  l John 1:9 - confession of sins. Confess means to identify or name
our sins, which is non-meritorious - do nothing! Eph. 5:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but
be filled with the Spirit,” (Ephesians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Manifestations of Spirituality </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every believer is commanded by God to be filled with the
Holy Spirit whereby their soul is controlled by the Holy Spirit. Because it is
a command, the believer’s volition determines whether they do or do not. In Ephesians
5:18, “be filled” in the Greek is <span lang=EL>πληρο</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(plēroō) and means to “keep on being filled.” </p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but
be filled with the Spirit,” (Ephesians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Holy Spirit is our teacher and mentor when we are in
fellowship. The Holy Spirit makes Bible doctrine understandable to us and
teaches our human spirit. The Holy Spirit is the only means by which we learn
and are empowered to apply Bible doctrine in the spiritual life. 1 John 2:27;
Gal. 5:16; Gal. 5:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“As for you, the anointing which you received from Him abides
in you, and you have no need for anyone to teach you; but as His anointing
teaches you about all things, and is true and is not a lie, and just as it has
taught you, you abide in Him.” (1 John 2:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the
desire of the flesh.” (Galatians 5:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no
law.” (Galatians 5:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 13:14, we are to “put on the Lord Jesus
Christ.” In 1 John 1:7, were told to “walk in the Light as He Himself is in the
Light.”</p>

<p class=Verses>“But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for
the flesh in regard to its lusts.” (Romans 13:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“but if we walk in the Light as He Himself is in the Light, we
have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us
from all sin.” (1 John 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer’s thinking steadily becomes “conformed to
the image of His Son” and “Christ is formed” in the soul and the thinking of
the believer. Rom. 8:29; Gal. 4:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become
conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many
brethren;” (Romans 8:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“My children, with whom I am again in labor until Christ is
formed in you—” (Galatians 4:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One person, Adam, caused our condemnation. One Person,
Jesus Christ, executed our salvation. One Person only can glorify Christ - God
the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit does this from the inside. Either He fills
your life, or He is grieved or quenched. The Holy Spirit is to be utilized
because He has been provided. It is not you doing something which you think
will bring glory to Him. Only the Holy Spirit can glorify Christ. John 10:14;
John 7:39; 1 Cor. 6:19-20; John 16:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I am the good shepherd, and I know My own and My own
know Me,” (John 10:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But this He spoke of the Spirit, whom those who believed in
Him were to receive; for the Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not
yet glorified.” (John 7:39, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy
Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and that you are not your own?
For you have been bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body.” (1
Corinthians 6:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;He will glorify Me, for He will take of Mine and will
disclose it to you.” (John 16:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer filled with the Holy Spirit magnifies Christ
in their spiritual life. Eph. 3:16-17; 2 Cor. 3:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory,
to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inner man, so that
Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; and that you, being rooted and
grounded in love,” (Ephesians 3:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“being manifested that you are a letter of Christ, cared for by
us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets
of stone but on tablets of human hearts.” (2 Corinthians 3:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer filled with the Holy Spirit has the
character of Christ (incarnate) produced in them. The believer filled with the
Holy Spirit produces divine good, in contrast to the carnal believer who
produces only human good. In 1 Corinthians 3:11-16, divine good is the gold,
silver, and precious stones produced by the spiritual believer whereas human
good is the wood, hay, and straw produced by the carnal believer. Gal. 4:19;
Phil. 1:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For no man can lay a foundation other than the one which is
laid, which is Jesus Christ. Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold,
silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, each man's work will become evident;
for the day will show it because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire
itself will test the quality of each man's work. If any man's work which he has
built on it remains, he will receive a reward. If any man's work is burned up,
he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire. Do
you not know that you are a temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in
you?” (1 Corinthians 3:11-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“My children, with whom I am again in labor until Christ is
formed in you—” (Galatians 4:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“according to my earnest expectation and hope, that I will not
be put to shame in anything, but that with all boldness, Christ will even now,
as always, be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death.” (Philippians
1:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer in fellowship imitates God. In Ephesians
5:1, “imitators” is <span lang=EL>μιμητη</span>́<span lang=EL>ς</span>
(mimētēs) in the Greek and means “to keep on becoming imitators of God, as beloved
children.” Eph. 5:18; Eph. 1:6. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children;”
(Ephesians 5:1, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but
be filled with the Spirit,” (Ephesians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely
bestowed on us in the Beloved.” (Ephesians 1:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer out of fellowship imitates the unbeliever. 1
John 1:6; 2 Cor. 3:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the
darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth;” (1 John 1:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“being manifested that you are a letter of Christ, cared for by
us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets
of stone but on tablets of human hearts.” (2 Corinthians 3:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Believer Cannot Sin While in a State of
Spirituality </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 John 3:9 is a great verse which stresses the absolute
concept of spirituality. When a believer is in fellowship and controlled by the
Holy Spirit, they are not sinning. When they are out of fellowship or
controlled by the old sin nature, they can do nothing but sin.</p>

<p class=Verses>“No one who is born of God practices sin, because His seed<span
style='color:windowtext'> </span>abides in him; and he cannot sin, because he
is born of God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 John 3:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This verse refers to the believer controlled by the Holy
Spirit. When the Holy Spirit controls the believer, they cannot sin. The Holy
Spirit is God and, therefore could never sin nor solicit or condone sin. Only
ignorance of sin or negative volition at the point of temptation can break the
soul control of the Holy Spirit. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has provided the means of victory in grace over the
old sin nature. The procedure involves the stages of the Grace Apparatus for
Perception. The believer in fellowship listens to the  communication of Bible
doctrine whereby the Holy Spirit teaches the human spirit making the Bible
doctrine taught academically comprehended information. The Holy Spirit then
transfers the understood spiritual information to the left lobe of the
mentality of the soul as <i>gnosis</i>. By positive faith belief in that <i>gnosis</i>
Bible doctrine, the Holy Spirit then converts the <i>gnosis</i> to <i>epignosis</i>
or full knowledge and transfers it to the right lobe of the soul. Here, it is
stored in the compartments of  the right lobe for application to life. This
accumulated <i>epignosis</i> fills the believer’s spiritual frame of reference whereby
the edification complex of the soul is constructed. See category on <a
href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/G/Grace%20Apparatus%20For%20Perception.html">The Grace Apparatus For Perception</a>. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is incompatible with the divine nature to originate
sin. Grace found a way to overcome the bondage of the old sin nature -
summarized by “cannot sin” in 1 John 3:9. To be “born of God” means to live in
union with Jesus Christ under the indwelling of the Holy Spirit with a
permanent relationship with God the Father. By the filling of the Holy Spirit,
the believer takes on the family resemblance.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The unbeliever has a nature of sin and lives habitually
under the control of the old sin nature. The believer has the nature of God and
therefore God has provided a basis for taking on the form of family resemblance
through the filling of the Holy Spirit. However, in practice, the believer can
walk in the Light or in darkness.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>After regeneration at the point of salvation, we are
given the filling of the Holy Spirit, but also still have the genetically
formed old sin nature which can only tempt our volition to cause sin. The
believer possesses the ability not to sin when filled with the Holy Spirit, but
by negative volition they can choose to move under the old sin nature and
imitate the unbeliever. The believer under the control of the old sin nature
and can only produce sin, evil and human good. There is no such thing as
sinless perfection – except for Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>How the Holy Spirit Controls the Soul</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers today seem to be victims of a number of
Christian life concepts going around in their minds. Some speakers stress the
crucified life, others the broken life, still others say the answer is
yielding. Another speaker will come down the pike and challenge everybody to
bow at the foot of the Cross (he is talking to believers) and “plead the blood.”
Still others are talking about the deeper life, the committed life, or the
involved life. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All these speakers mean well, but in the average
believer’s mind, all these concepts are swirling around in their mind and are
bewildering. It’s nothing unusual to have evangelical pastors tell us that they
(even being in the ministry) have no dogmatic concept of what the Christian
life is really about. They are not quite sure. Ministers are supposed to know
the Word, but do all of them know? Sadly, no.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual growth is a process of learning Bible doctrine
communicated via the grace apparatus for perception. Spiritual growth can only
occur when filled with the Holy Spirit resulting in an absolute state of
spirituality and is based on the accumulation of <i>epignosis</i> Bible
doctrine in the right lobe of the soul. Spiritual growth requires consistent
intake and application of Bible doctrine to the spiritual life. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are three Greek words used in the time of Christ to
describe soldiers in warfare. “Hastati” were young recruits in the front ranks
who threw the javelin and is analogous to new converts or babes in Christ who
have not yet learned much Bible doctrine. “Princeps” was the second line made
up of young vigorous men who were strong and powerful, analogous to the growing
believer. “Triarii” was the third line made up of the old and experienced
veterans, analogous to the mature believer. 1 John 2:12-14 also speaks of three
degrees of spiritual growth. The little children are spiritual babes, the young
men are spiritual adolescents, and the fathers are spiritually mature
believers.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I am writing to you, little children, because your sins
have been forgiven you for His name's sake. I am writing to you, fathers,
because you know Him who has been from the beginning. I am writing to you,
young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I have written to you,
children, because you know the Father. I have written to you, fathers, because
you know Him who has been from the beginning. I have written to you, young men,
because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome
the evil one.&quot;  (1 John 2:12-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are no degrees of spirituality, but degrees of
spiritual growth. Spirituality and spiritual growth work together. One who
walks in the Spirit the majority of the time will mature faster spiritually. So
the injunction is to consistently walk in the Spirit and grow up spiritually. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Spirituality and the Mosaic Law</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ was the only human being to completely
fulfill the Mosaic Law. Jesus Christ kept every part of the Mosaic Law because
He had no old sin nature, no personal sin, and therefore, could keep it. Matt.
5:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the
Prophets; I did not come to abolish but to fulfill.” (Matthew 5:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Because Christ fulfilled the Law, Church Age believers
are not under the Mosaic Law. Rom. 10:4; Gal. 5:18; Gal. 5:22-23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone
who believes.” (Romans 10:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the Law.”
(Galatians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience,
kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things
there is no law.” (Galatians 5:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The righteousness of the Law is satisfied by the filling
of the Holy Spirit. When the Holy Spirit controls the Church Age believer’s
soul, the Holy Spirit produces something greater than the Mosaic Law could ever
produce. Therefore, the believer is under a new law. However, the believer is
not lawless. Rom. 8:2-4; Rom. 10:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you
free from the law of sin and of death. For what the Law could not do, weak as
it was through the flesh, God did: sending His own Son in the likeness of
sinful flesh and as an offering for sin, He condemned sin in the flesh, so that
the requirement of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according
to the flesh but according to the Spirit.” (Romans 8:2-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone
who believes.” (Romans 10:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Since the believer is under a new law, they have to have
a new commandment. Under the old Mosaic Law you had ten basic commandments,
plus many others. This one new commandment is expressed in many ways. In
Ephesians 5:18, we are to be “filled with the Spirit.” In Galatians 5:16, we
are told to “walk by the Spirit.” </p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but
be filled with the Spirit,” (Ephesians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the
desire of the flesh.” (Galatians 5:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The new law manifests itself in the Church Age believer
as they grow spiritually as strength in the spiritual life through the enabling
power of the Holy Spirit. The “fruit of the Spirit” becomes evident as the
growing believer produces divine good. Eph. 3:16-17; Gal. 5:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory,
to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inner man, so that
Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; and that you, being rooted and
grounded in love,” (Ephesians 3:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience,
kindness, goodness, faithfulness,” (Galatians 5:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Church Age vs. Millennial Spirituality</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Church Age, when believers are in fellowship with
the Lord, they produce the character of the glorified Jesus Christ while we
represent Him on earth while He is away. The erection of the edification complex
in the believers’ souls reflects the glory of God. John 7:39; Gal. 4:19; Gal.
5:22-23; Eph. 5:1-2; Eph. 5:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But this He spoke of the Spirit, whom those who believed in
Him were to receive; for the Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not
yet glorified.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 7:39, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“My children, with whom I am again in labor until Christ is
formed in you—”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Galatians 4:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience,
kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things
there is no law.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Galatians 5:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children; and walk
in love, just as Christ also loved you and gave Himself up for us, an offering
and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 5:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but
be filled with the Spirit,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The spirituality of the believers in the Church Age is
not characterized by emotion or ecstatics, Rom. 16:17-18; 2 Cor. 6:11-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now I urge you, brethren, keep your eye on those who
cause dissensions and hindrances contrary to the teaching which you learned,
and turn away from them. For such men are slaves, not of our Lord Christ but of
their own appetites; and by their smooth and flattering speech they deceive the
hearts of the unsuspecting.&quot;  (Romans 16:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Our mouth has spoken freely to you, O Corinthians, our
heart is opened wide. You are not restrained by us, but you are restrained in
your own affections.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 6:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Millennium, spirituality will be associated with
emotion and ecstatics because Jesus Christ will be physically on earth ruling.
There will be perfect environment and religion will be removed. The indwelling
and filling of the Holy Spirit will be designed to appreciate Christ who is
present. Believers will have the same filling of the Spirit that we have in the
Church Age, but it will be expressed in different ways. Joel 2:28-29.</p>

<p class=Verses>““It will come about after this That I will pour out My Spirit
on all mankind; And your sons and daughters will prophesy, Your old men will
dream dreams, Your young men will see visions. “Even on the male and female
servants I will pour out My Spirit in those days.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Joel 2:28-29,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Indwelling vs. Filling of the Holy Spirit</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The indwelling and filling of the Holy Spirit are not the
same and are considerably different in purpose and function. The indwelling of
the Holy Spirit is permanent and functions within the Church Age believer’s
physical body. The filling of the Holy Spirit is temporary and functions inside
the believer’s human spirit and soul. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The indwelling of the Holy Spirit provides a temple in
our bodies for the indwelling of the deity of Jesus Christ as the Shekinah
Glory. The indwelling Shekinah Glory is our guarantee of divine blessing. God
the Son could not indwell our bodies where the old sin nature resides unless
God the Holy Spirit first prepared a suitable residence or temple for Him. 1
Cor. 3:16; 1 Cor. 6:19-20; 2 Cor. 6:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do you not know that you are a temple of God and that the
Spirit of God dwells in you?” (1 Corinthians 3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy
Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and that you are not your own?
For you have been bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body.” (1
Corinthians 6:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Or what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For we are
the temple of the living God; just as God said, &quot;I WILL DWELL IN THEM AND
WALK AMONG THEM; AND I WILL BE THEIR GOD, AND THEY SHALL BE MY PEOPLE.” (2
Corinthians 6:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The indwelling of the Holy Spirit is permanent and not
affected by the believer’s status of carnality or spirituality. All Church Age believers
are indwelt by the Holy Spirit. The difference between being carnal and
spiritual is the filling of the Spirit, not the indwelling of the Spirit. See
category on the<span style='color:#0432FF'> </span><a
href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/H/Holy%20Spirit%2C%20Indwelling.html">Holy Spirit, Indwelling</a><span
style='color:#0432FF'>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The filling of the Holy Spirit is temporary and functions
inside the Church Age believer’s human spirit and soul. When the believer's
soul is controlled by the Holy Spirit, they are in an absolute state of
spirituality. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The purpose of the filling of the Holy Spirit is to
provide God's very own power for the believer in fellowship to fulfill God's
plan for their life. Through spiritual growth, the believer learns how to
remain filled with the Holy Spirit for longer periods of time.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The filling of the Holy Spirit is necessary for the grace
apparatus for perception to operate and thereby enable the believer with
positive volition to believe and then apply <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine to
their life. We can do nothing to fulfill God's purpose for each of us without
the enabling power of the Holy Spirit. See category on the <a
href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/F/Filling%20of%20the%20Holy%20Spirit.html">Filling of the Holy Spirit</a>. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When the believer decides to sin, they immediately lose
the filling of the Holy Spirit and gain the old sin nature control of their
soul. The believer cannot actually commit any sin while filled with the Holy
Spirit. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Confession of sin to God the Father using 1 John 1:9 is
the only means by which the believer can  recover the filling of the Holy
Spirit. You cannot pray to be filled with the Holy Spirit. Confession of sin is
accomplished by naming or citing your known sins to God the Father in prayer
which results in forgiveness of those sins cited and all other sins you did not
remember (all unrighteousness) resulting in God's promise of the regaining of
the filling of the Holy Spirit. Gal. 5:16; Eph. 5:18; 2 Peter 1:4; 1 John
2:20-21; 1 John 3:20-21. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the
desire of the flesh.” (Galatians 5:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but
be filled with the Spirit,” (Ephesians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For by these He has granted to us His precious and magnificent
promises, so that by them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having
escaped the corruption that is in the world by lust.” (2 Peter 1:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know.
I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do
know it, and because no lie is of the truth.” (1 John 2:20-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“in whatever our heart condemns us; for God is greater than our
heart and knows all things. Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have
confidence before God;” (1 John 3:20-21, NASB)</p>
