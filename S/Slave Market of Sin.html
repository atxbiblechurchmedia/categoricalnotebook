<h2><a name="_Soul"></a>Slave Market of Sin</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Through procreation, we all inherit Adam’s original sin at
birth which is imputed to our genetically formed old sin nature at our first
breath. Therefore, we all enter this world physically alive, but spiritually
dead. Rom. 5:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world,
and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned—”
(Romans 5:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are three categories of people in the human race –
immoral, moral, and religious. Rom. 1:18-32; Rom. 2:1-16; Isaiah 64:6; Rom.
2:17-29; Rom. 4:3-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all
ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in
unrighteousness, because that which is known about God is evident within them;
for God made it evident to them. For since the creation of the world His
invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly
seen, being understood through what has been made, so that they are without
excuse.” (Romans 1:18-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped
and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.
For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions; for their women
exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural,” (Romans 1:25-26,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But because of your stubbornness and unrepentant heart you are
storing up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath and revelation of the
righteous judgment of God,” (Romans 2:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“on the day when, according to my gospel, God will judge the
secrets of men through Christ Jesus.” (Romans 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For all of us have become like one who is unclean, And all our
righteous deeds are like a filthy garment; And all of us wither like a leaf,
And our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.” (Isaiah 64:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For &quot;THE NAME OF GOD IS BLASPHEMED AMONG THE GENTILES
BECAUSE OF YOU,&quot; just as it is written.” (Romans 2:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For what does the Scripture say? &quot;ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD,
AND IT WAS CREDITED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS.&quot; Now to the one who works,
his wage is not credited as a favor, but as what is due. But to the one who
does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is
credited as righteousness,” (Romans 4:3-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All three categories of people have sinned and come short
of God’s standard of absolute righteousness (+R). All are born in the slave
market of sin. Rom. 3:23; John 8:34-35.</p>

<p class=Verses>“for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,”
(Romans 3:23, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“Jesus answered them, &quot;Truly, truly, I say to you,
everyone who commits sin is the slave of sin. &quot;The slave does not remain
in the house forever; the son does remain forever.” (John 8:34-35, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Adhering to the Mosaic Law cannot get one person out of
the slave market of sin. Only a free man can free a slave. Only Jesus Christ
was born free from sin and without an old sin nature and did not commit
personal sin. Gal. 3:10-11; 2 Cor. 5:21. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For as many as are of the works of the Law are under a curse;
for it is written, &quot;CURSED IS EVERYONE WHO DOES NOT ABIDE BY ALL THINGS
WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE LAW, TO PERFORM THEM.&quot; Now that no one is
justified by the Law before God is evident; for, &quot;THE RIGHTEOUS MAN SHALL
LIVE BY FAITH.&quot;” (Galatians 3:10-11, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that
we might become the righteousness of God in Him.” (2 Corinthians 5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Why was Jesus Christ born free from sin and without an
old sin nature? The virgin birth. The old sin nature is passed down by the
father. Jesus Christ had no human father. Therefore, He had no old sin nature
and was a free man, not born in the slave market of sin! Psalms 51:5; Matt.
1:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, And in sin my mother
conceived me.” (Psalms 51:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But when he had considered this, behold, an angel of the Lord
appeared to him in a dream, saying, &quot;Joseph, son of David, do not be
afraid to take Mary as your wife; for the Child who has been conceived in her
is of the Holy Spirit.” (Matthew 1:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Lord Jesus Christ bought us from the slave market of
sin by paying the price of our judgment on the Cross. 1 Peter 1:18-19; 1 Cor.
6:20. </p>

<p class=Verses>“knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable things like
silver or gold from your futile way of life inherited from your forefathers,
but with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and spotless, the blood of
Christ.” (1 Peter 1:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For you have been bought with a price: therefore glorify God
in your body.” (1 Corinthians 6:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This freedom from the slave market of sin and from debt
is dependent upon the exercise of an individual’s positive volition. The gate
has been removed! There is only one way out of the slave market. The issue is do
you believe in the work of Jesus Christ for your sins or are you going to
reject that grace gift?  John 14:6; John 8:36.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Jesus said to him, &quot;I am the way, and the truth, and the
life; no one comes to the Father but through Me.” (John 14:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;So if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed.”
(John 8:36, NASB)</p>
