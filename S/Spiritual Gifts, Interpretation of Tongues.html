<h2>Spiritual Gifts, Interpretation of Tongues</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The temporary spiritual gift of the interpretation or
translation of tongues was the ability to translate accurately what was being
said to the foreign unbelievers present, making sure that the one giving the
message in a foreign tongue was giving accurate Gospel information. The gift of
tongues never functioned without the gift of interpretation of tongues also
functioning. This was not simply being well educated in numerous languages. The
ones who had this gift would not even know the languages that they were
translating! Those that had the gift of giving the Gospel to an unbeliever in
his own language (tongues), a language they themselves did not understand,
never had the gift of interpretation of tongues. This was so that people in the
congregation would believe in the accuracy of the message and that those
speaking in foreign languages were not just cranking out gibberish. God had a
very special way to make sure that everything was done in decency and order. 1
Cor. 12:10; 1 Cor. 12:30.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and to another the effecting of miracles, and to another
prophecy, and to another the distinguishing of spirits, to another various
kinds of tongues, and to another the interpretation of tongues.&quot;  (1
Corinthians 12:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;All do not have gifts of healings, do they? All do not
speak with tongues, do they? All do not interpret, do they?&quot;  (1
Corinthians 12:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It was up to the apostles, leaders in the church and the
pastor-teacher to make sure the person with the gift of tongues was accurate.
By requiring an interpreter to be present, they could verify the accuracy of
the message. The gift of interpretation or translation was always used in
association with the gift of tongues. God the Holy Spirit would prompt
believers to stand up and give the proper interpretation of tongues or exactly
what the believer was communicating to the foreign unbelievers present as far
as Gospel information was concerned. If someone with the gift of tongues wanted
to speak, but  there was no one present with the gift of interpretation of
tongues, that person would remain seated and remain silent. 1 Cor. 14:27-28.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If anyone speaks in a tongue, it should be by two or at
the most three, and each in turn, and one must interpret; but if there is no
interpreter, he must keep silent in the church; and let him speak to himself
and to God.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 14:27-28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>After 70 AD, those that claim they are speaking in
tongues or performing interpretation of tongues are contrary to the Word of
God. They are involved in either an emotional performance to demonstrate they
are filled with the Spirit, which they are not, or they are under demon
influence. The engastrimuthos or ventriloquist demon speaks the language of demons
and can also speak in many existing human foreign languages. They can also mimic
someone's voice or “throw” their voice. This is tongues today as a satanic
operation and is part of the perversion of the temporary spiritual gift of tongues.
Any “tongues” spoken from 70 AD right on down to the Rapture of the Church is a
perversion.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The phrase “a spirit from the ground” in Isaiah 29:4
refers the ventriloquist demon. This is just part of Isaiah’s prophecy about
pseudo-tongues. The engastrimuthos demon controls the vocal cords of the
unbeliever who speaks in tongues as a satanic operation to distract that person
he indwells from either salvation in the case of unbelievers or from Bible
truth in the case of others who are believers. He exactly and accurately
reproduces the gift of tongues that has long since ceased. This explains how
unbelievers can be involved in pseudo-tongues because only unbelievers can be
demon possessed.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then you will be brought low; From the earth you will
speak, And from the dust where you are prostrate Your words will come. Your
voice will also be like that of a spirit from the ground, And your speech will
whisper from the dust.&quot;  (Isaiah 29:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Remember that tongues and the interpretation of tongues
were the first temporary gifts to be removed. The second spiritual gift to be
removed was healing. The third spiritual gift to be removed was apostleship.
The rest of the temporary spiritual gifts were removed anywhere between 96 and
100 AD.  Some possibly were functioning after 96 AD until the Canon was
circulated.</p>
