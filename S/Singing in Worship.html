<h2>Singing in Worship</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>There are three categories of
biblical songs: psalms, hymns (directly addressed to God), and spiritual songs.
Singing is the expression of a believer in a local church. Singing is best
expressed based on the Bible doctrine in the believer’s soul. It has greatest
meaning when the singer is spiritually mature. Singing, like everything
worthwhile in the spiritual life, should always done while filled with the Holy
Spirit. Eph. 5:18.</p>

<p class=Verses> “And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but
be filled with the Spirit,” (Ephesians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>In Colossians 3:16, singing is
proceeded by “Let the word of Christ richly dwell within you” which refers to
Bible doctrine in the soul. Singing is an expression of doctrine in the soul
expressing itself outwardly with people as the chief benefactor. The Greek
terms indicate that singing is vocal and to be accompanied with instruments.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Let the word of Christ richly dwell within you, with all
wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual
songs, singing with thankfulness in your hearts to God.” (Colossians 3:16,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Colossians 3:16, we find what singing accomplishes
toward other believers within a congregation. The Greek word <span lang=EL>διδα</span>́<span
lang=EL>σκω</span> (didaskō) means to teach. Singing is designed as a teaching
tool. The Greek word <span lang=EL>νουθετε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(noutheteō) means to admonish, to remind, to put in mind, to warm, to exhort.
Singing is designed as an admonishing tool. Therefore, singing has the
following factors: praise to God, teaching of each other through singing,
warning, encouraging, and exhorting each other through singing.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>In Ephesians 5:19, singing is an
expression of the soul of one who is filled with the Spirit and it is chiefly
directed toward God. Emphasis is on the proper attitude of the soul. </p>

<p class=Verses>“speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual
songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord;” (Ephesians 5:19,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>In Revelation 5:9, singing
relates to the Church Age believer and is seen to be occurring in heaven in
connection with victory or conquering. Singing is said to be done unto the
Lord. Although it will benefit the congregation, their benefit will glorify the
Lord. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And they sang a new song, saying, &quot;Worthy are You to take
the book and to break its seals; for You were slain, and purchased for God with
Your blood men from every tribe and tongue and people and nation.” (Revelation
5:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>What Singing is Not </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>Singing is not the measure of
spirituality or vigor of a local church. The filling of the Spirit is necessary
for singing, but singing is no proof of the filling of the Spirit. Singing in a
local church is not designed to be used to create a mood for the soul, but
rather is an expression of that which the filling of the Spirit and Bible
doctrine have already created in the soul. Singing is not to be measured by the
quantity of zeal employed, but by the understanding accompanying it. 1 Cor.
14:15. </p>

<p class=Verses>“What is the outcome then? I will pray with the spirit and I
will pray with the mind also; I will sing with the spirit and I will sing with
the mind also.” (1 Corinthians 14:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>Singing is not designed to give
you a good feeling. If it is praise, it is directed to God. If it is teaching,
it is designed for your learning. If it is admonishment, it is designed for
your warning, comfort, challenge, and motivation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>Singing is not the primary
function in a worship service of a local church. Spirituality and teaching
Bible doctrine are the primary functions. Singing should not be your motive for
attendance of a church. Some people say, “I go there because the singing is so
great. I can even tolerate the message.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>English and Greek Words Related to Singing</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Song: <span lang=EL>ω</span>̓ͅ<span lang=EL>δη</span>́
(ōdē): A song in praise of God or Christ. This word has the adjective
“spiritual” attached to it. The Greek word can mean any kind of song, a battle
song, a harvest song, a festal song, etc. Therefore, the term “spiritual” is
added to limit the kind of song which can be sung. A good number of the songs
in hymn books would be classified by this term “spiritual songs.” Eph. 5:9;
Col. 3:16; Rev. 5:9; Rev.14:3. A song taught by Moses and Christ. Rev. 15:3. </p>

<p class=Verses>“(for the fruit of the Light consists in all goodness and
righteousness and truth),” (Ephesians 5:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Let the word of Christ richly dwell within you, with all
wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual
songs, singing with thankfulness in your hearts to God.” (Colossians 3:16,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And they sang a new song, saying, &quot;Worthy are You to take
the book and to break its seals; for You were slain, and purchased for God with
Your blood men from every tribe and tongue and people and nation.” (Revelation
5:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And they sang a new song before the throne and before the four
living creatures and the elders; and no one could learn the song except the one
hundred and forty-four thousand who had been purchased from the earth.”
(Revelation 14:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And they sang the song of Moses, the bond-servant of God, and
the song of the Lamb, saying, &quot;Great and marvelous are Your works, O Lord
God, the Almighty; Righteous and true are Your ways, King of the nations!”
(Revelation 15:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sing: <span lang=EL>α</span>̓́ͅ<span lang=EL>δω</span>
(adō): To sing or chant to the praise of anyone. Rev. 5:9; Rev. 14:3; Rev.
15:3. In Ephesians 5:19 and Colossians 3:16, it is used as the lyrical emotion
of a devout and grateful soul. </p>

<p class=Verses>“speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual
songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord;” (Ephesians 5:19,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Let the word of Christ richly dwell within you, with all
wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual
songs, singing with thankfulness in your hearts to God.” (Colossians 3:16,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Melody: <span lang=EL>ψα</span>́<span lang=EL>λλω</span>
(psallō): To twang the strings of a musical instrument so that they gently

<p class=Verses>“speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual
songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord;” (Ephesians 5:19,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and for the Gentiles to glorify God for His mercy; as it is
written, &quot;THEREFORE I WILL GIVE PRAISE TO YOU AMONG THE GENTILES, AND I
WILL SING TO YOUR NAME.&quot;” (Romans 15:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“What is the outcome then? I will pray with the spirit and I
will pray with the mind also; I will sing with the spirit and I will sing with
the mind also.” (1 Corinthians 14:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Is anyone among you suffering? Then he must pray. Is anyone
cheerful? He is to sing praises.” (James 5:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Hymn: <span lang=EL>υ</span>̔́<span lang=EL>μνος</span>
(humnos):<b> </b>A song or direct address of praise to God. A sacred hymn. Used
in isagogical literature as a song in praise of gods, heroes and conquerors. Augustine

<p class=Verses>“speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual
songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord;” (Ephesians 5:19,

MIDST OF THE CONGREGATION I WILL SING YOUR PRAISE.&quot;” (Hebrews 2:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Music: <span lang=EL>συμφωνι</span>́<span lang=EL>α</span>
(sumphōnia): To sound together, be in accord, sounds of musical instruments.
In the New Testament, it means to harmonize, to agree together, to agree with
one in making a bargain, to make an agreement. Luke 15:25.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Now his older son was in the field, and when he came and
approached the house, he heard music and dancing.” (Luke 15:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>A Brief History of Hymnology</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Hymns, sacred odes, and poems were intended to be sung in
praise or prayer to deities. A tablet dating 800 BC contains a Sumerian hymn on
the creation. A large body of early Christian hymns was written by men such as
St. John of Damascus and St. Ambrose of Milan. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Toward the end of the Middle Ages, there arose a demand
for congregational singing. This first expressed itself in spiritual songs and
carols. During the Renaissance period (1501 AD), the first forerunner to the
modern hymnal was published at Prague for the Moravian Brethren. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Martin Luther (1523 -1546 AD) and his followers created a
considerable collection of chorales which rank among the finest congregational
hymns. Under John Calvin at Geneva, the musical reformation developed hymns
based on metrical paraphrases of Psalms prepared in French by Clement Marot and
Theodore de Bége between 1539-1562 AD and were translated by Ambrosius
Lobwasser for the Reformed Church in Germany. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In England, the hymns of the congregation were limited
almost exclusively to metrical Psalms prepared by Thomas Steinhold and John
Hopkins from 1549-1562 AD. They continued in predominance until 1696 AD. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Evangelical hymnology began at the end of the 17th
century. In the Lutheran Church, the Pietism Movement started a fresh wave of
hymn writing. In England, John and Charles Wesley began what later became the
most popular evangelical hymnology of the English speaking world. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>John Wesley’s first, “Collection of Psalms &amp; Hymns”
was published in 1737 at Charlestown, South Carolina. Charles Wesley, John’s
brother, wrote 6,500 hymns. Isaac Watts, a contemporary English hymn writer,
wrote “Hymns and Spiritual Songs” (1707-09) and has been called the creator of
the modern English hymn. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Reformation hymns had the texts prepared with no
particular tune in mind and a separate musician would write music for a number
of them that fit the meter. One such music writer was Louis Bourgeois of
Geneva. Tunes given to lyrics were also later given certain names or
designations.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Music and Singing in the Old Testament</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Music and singing accompanied the departing of honored
guests. Gen. 31:27.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Why did you flee secretly and deceive me, and did not
tell me so that I might have sent you away with joy and with songs, with
timbrel and with lyre;” (Genesis 31:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Music was used in signaling the triumph over a nation’s
enemy. Exodus 15:20. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Miriam the prophetess, Aaron's sister, took the timbrel in her
hand, and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dancing.”
(Exodus 15:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Music welcomed conquerors in victory. Judges 11:34.</p>

<p class=Verses>“When Jephthah came to his house at Mizpah, behold, his
daughter was coming out to meet him with tambourines and with dancing. Now she
was his one and only child; besides her he had no son or daughter.” (Judges
11:34, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Music was used in casting out evil spirits. 1 Sam. 18:10.
</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now it came about on the next day that an evil spirit from God
came mightily upon Saul, and he raved in the midst of the house, while David
was playing the harp with his hand, as usual; and a spear was in Saul's hand.”
(1 Samuel 18:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Music was used to excite inspiration of a prophet and
soothe the temper. 2 Kings 3:15. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But now bring me a minstrel.&quot; And it came about,
when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him.” (2 Kings
3:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew indicates many types of emotional involvement
in music. Jeering songs against Job in Job 30:9. Joy and sorrow. Hope and fear.
Doubt and faith. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;And now I have become their taunt, I have even become a
byword to them.” (Job 30:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Jews were commanded to sing one of their famous songs
while in captivity in Psalms 137:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For there our captors demanded of us songs, And our tormentors
mirth, saying, &quot;Sing us one of the songs of Zion.&quot;” (Psalms 137:3,
NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In latter Jewish Old Testament times, music formed as
essential part of the national worship of Jehovah. Many arrangements were made
for its best performance. For example, they would recite the many genealogies
found in 1 Chronicles. The whole body of the temple chorus and orchestra
numbered 4,000. They were trained and conducted in 24 divisions by three men – Asaph,
Heman, and Jeduthun. The trained and untrained were combined in function. The
trained provided the tradition and quality for the untrained to learn in. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At each reformation in the Jewish National Religion under
Hezekiah, Josiah, Nehemiah, the reconstruction of the temple chorus and
orchestra with their duties was properly accomplished. 2 Chron. 29:25; 2 Chron.
34; Ezra 3:10; Neh. 12:27.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He then stationed the Levites in the house of the LORD with
cymbals, with harps and with lyres, according to the command of David and of
Gad the king's seer, and of Nathan the prophet; for the command was from the
LORD through His prophets.” (2 Chronicles 29:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now when the builders had laid the foundation of the temple of
the LORD, the priests stood in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites,
the sons of Asaph, with cymbals, to praise the LORD according to the directions
of King David of Israel.” (Ezra 3:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought out
the Levites from all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem so that they
might celebrate the dedication with gladness, with hymns of thanksgiving and
with songs to the accompaniment of cymbals, harps and lyres.” (Nehemiah 12:27,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Musical Instruments of the Old Testament</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Musical instruments of the Old Testament fall into three
groups: string, wind, and percussion. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The lyre, <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>כּנּור</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(kinnôr) was a
stringed instrument used for popular and sacred music. 1 Sam. 16:16. It was used
at banquets in Isaiah 5:12. It was the usual accompaniment for a song. 1 Chron.
15:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Let our lord now command your servants who are before
you. Let them seek a man who is a skillful player on the harp; and it shall
come about when the evil spirit from God is on you, that he shall play the harp
with his hand, and you will be well.&quot;” (1 Samuel 16:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Their banquets are accompanied by lyre and harp, by tambourine
and flute, and by wine; But they do not pay attention to the deeds of the LORD,
Nor do they consider the work of His hands.” (Isaiah 5:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then David spoke to the chiefs of the Levites to appoint their
relatives the singers, with instruments of music, harps, lyres, loud-sounding
cymbals, to raise sounds of joy.” (1 Chronicles 15:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The harp, <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>נֶבֶל</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(nebel) was a musical
instrument, either a portable harp or guitar with ten strings played at feasts,
in worship, and in religious ceremonies. It was cheaper and more common than
the lyre, which was a mark of luxury. 2 Sam. 6:5; 2 Chron.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Meanwhile, David and all the house of Israel were celebrating
before the LORD with all kinds of instruments made of fir wood, and with lyres,
harps, tambourines, castanets and cymbals.” (2 Samuel 6:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The horn or trumpet, <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שׁוֹפָר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(shophar) was a curved horn of a species
of wild goat and was mostly used in war and rarely used as a sacred instrument.
Hosea 8:1; Joshua 6:5; Joshua 6:20. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Put the trumpet to your lips! Like an eagle the enemy comes
against the house of the LORD, Because they have transgressed My covenant And
rebelled against My law.” (Hosea 8:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;It shall be that when they make a long blast with the
ram's horn, and when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall
shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city will fall down flat, and the
people will go up every man straight ahead.&quot;” (Joshua 6:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So the people shouted, and priests blew the trumpets; and when
the people heard the sound of the trumpet, the people shouted with a great
shout and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city,
every man straight ahead, and they took the city.” (Joshua 6:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The horn <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שׁוֹפָר</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(shophar) was used on
religious occasions. Joshua 6:4; 2 Chron. 16:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Also seven priests shall carry seven trumpets of rams'
