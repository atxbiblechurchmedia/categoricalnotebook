<h2><a name="_Lesson_9_–"></a>Importance of Spirituality </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Often today the talented Christian, the Christian with a
tremendous amount of human hustle and ability, the Christian with a naturally
meek and mild temperament, and the Christian with the great personality are considered
by many to be spiritual giants, or at least spiritual persons. The believer
does not depend upon the flesh, but the Spirit of God and the Word of God. 2
Cor. 10:3-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according
to the flesh, for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but divinely
powerful for the destruction of fortresses.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 10:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Old Testament, the Holy Spirit empowered specific
people for specified jobs. The Holy Spirit gave some people special
understanding and wisdom. They became great leaders of God’s people, such as
some of the judges. They revealed God’s word as writers of the Old Testament.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Holy Spirit gave some special skills or unusual
physical strength for use in God’s service such as workers on the tabernacle
and Samson. The Holy Spirit was then removed because either their work was
finished or because of sin.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It was not God’s purpose to fill or live in every
believer in the Old Testament. God chose to give certain believers the Holy
Spirit for His purpose. The Holy Spirit empowered some believers in the Old
Testament, but not all. It was not their qualification, but was God’s sovereign
decision. It is not who and what they were, but who and what God is. Psalms 135:6.
</p>

<p class=Verses>“Whatever the LORD pleases, He does, In heaven and in earth, in
the seas and in all deeps.” (Psalms 135:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Old Testament times, one could ask for the Holy Spirit
and receive Him under special conditions. For example, Elisha’s request was
granted in 2 Kings 2:9 and 2 Kings 2:15. </p>

<p class=Verses>“When they had crossed over, Elijah said to Elisha, &quot;Ask
what I shall do for you before I am taken from you.&quot; And Elisha said,
&quot;Please, let a double portion of your spirit be upon me.&quot;” (2 Kings
2:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now when the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho opposite
him saw him, they said, &quot;The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.&quot; And
they came to meet him and bowed themselves to the ground before him.” (2 Kings
2:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Kings 19, Elijah illustrates the principle of the
importance of being controlled by the Holy Spirit. When the believer’s soul is
controlled by the Holy Spirit, the believer is a power for God, when not in
control, the believer is pitiful and a cowardly sort of person. Remember the
Holy Spirit indwells permanently every Church Age believer, but controls the
believer’s soul only when they are in fellowship after having used 1 John 1:9
to confess their known sins biblically. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Kings 18, Elijah had had a mighty victory. Elijah
had used faith-rest and had put the problem into the Lord’s hands knowing that
the battle was the Lord’s. In 1 Kings 19:1, Ahab was a little tattle-tale and
ran to Jezebel and told her what happened. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and how
he had killed all the prophets with the sword.&quot;  (1 Kings 19:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Kings 19:2, this was a threat note. She was too
smart to send an assassin, but real smart to get him out of town without
hurting him. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, &quot;So
may the gods do to me and even more, if I do not make your life as the life of
one of them by tomorrow about this time.&quot;&quot;  (1 Kings 19:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Kings 19:3, Elijah arose and fled for his life to
Beersheba. He must have really covered the  ground in a hurry as this is
located in the extreme south of Palestine. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And he was afraid and arose and ran for his life and came
to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there.&quot;  (1
Kings 19:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Kings 19:4, Elijah went down into the desert and sat
under a juniper tree. Note the “wish I were dead routine!” Is this Elijah?
Pitiful! </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness,
and came and sat down under a juniper tree; and he requested for himself that
he might die, and said, &quot;It is enough; now, O LORD, take my life, for I am
not better than my fathers.&quot;&quot;  (1 Kings 19:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Kings 19:6, he was 200 miles away from where he
should have been. Did he deserve this food? No. This was God’s grace. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then he looked and behold, there was at his head a bread
cake baked on hot stones, and a jar of water. So he ate and drank and lay down
again.&quot;  (1 Kings 19:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Kings 19:9, he went to the hills in the Sinai
Peninsula and lodged there. Elijah, what are you doing here? </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then he came there to a cave and lodged there; and
behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and He said to him, &quot;What are
you doing here, Elijah?&quot;&quot;  (1 Kings 19:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Kings 19:10, note the emphasis is on “I.” He is
feeling sorry for himself, everybody is  wrong, etc. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He said, &quot;I have been very zealous for the LORD, the
God of hosts; for the sons of Israel have forsaken Your covenant, torn down
Your altars and killed Your prophets with the sword. And I alone am left; and
they seek my life, to take it away.&quot;&quot;  (1 Kings 19:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Kings 19:11, God says, “Come out of the cave Elijah,
you’ve got a lesson to learn.”</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So He said, &quot;Go forth and stand on the mountain
before the LORD.&quot; And behold, the LORD was passing by! And a great and
strong wind was rending the mountains and breaking in pieces the rocks before
the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind. And after the wind an earthquake,
but the LORD was not in the earthquake.&quot;  (1 Kings 19:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Note that as Elijah watched, the wind tore up the
mountains and rocks. The wind represents human power at its maximum! This
illustrates the principle that God does not operate in the believer on the
basis of human power. In 1 Kings 19:12, the earthquake illustrates this same
principle, as does fire in 1 Kings 19:13. A voice that doesn’t speak audibly,
but it is the most powerful force in the world is God’s power! Elijah needs to
be convinced that human power, human dynamics is nothing.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;After the earthquake a fire, but the LORD was not in the
fire; and after the fire a sound of a gentle blowing.&quot;  (1 Kings 19:12,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his mantle
and went out and stood in the entrance of the cave. And behold, a voice came to
him and said, &quot;What are you doing here, Elijah?&quot;&quot;  (1 Kings
19:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A Christian can read books, biographies, and can try to
duplicate other believer’s experiences, compensate by some works system, try to
humble themselves, practice the presence of God, or practice some system of
developing a Dale Carnegie personality, or practice the power of positive
thinking and never cut it and never please God! It is not human energy, human
dynamics that impresses God. It is the believer empowered by the Spirit of God
using Bible doctrine, the Word of God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A tombstone of one of the saints that was canonized has
this description: “He lived upon a dung heap, ate lettuce leaves and lemon
peels.” Tremendous? Not at all! It is humanly impossible to love all the
believers all of the time. It is humanly impossible to practice the presence of
God, to forgive others as Christ forgave in the flesh. It comes out phony every
time. Consequently, many churches today are mutual admiration societies, the
phoniest bunch that ever walked. Or the church has legalistic double standards.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Your Christian experience depends entirely upon the
filling of the Holy Spirit! If you do anything for God, it has to be done in
the power of the Spirit, that is, in control of your soul (in fellowship).
Zechariah 4:6 tells us that operating by means of the old sin nature cannot
please God. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then he said to me, &quot;This is the word of the LORD to
Zerubbabel saying, 'Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,' says the LORD
of hosts.&quot;  (Zechariah 4:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>So there was Elijah, a man who was a power for God on Mt.
Carmel, but he was out of fellowship and was a total flop, a timid coward. In 1
Kings 19:14, did Elijah get the point? No! Actually, Elijah was put on a shelf
and three men took his place. But before he died, he did get the point. How do
we know? Elisha asked one of his successors for a double portion of what?
Elijah’s spirit. Not power, not personality, but Elijah’s spirit.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then he said, &quot;I have been very zealous for the
LORD, the God of hosts; for the sons of Israel have forsaken Your covenant,
torn down Your altars and killed Your prophets with the sword. And I alone am
left; and they seek my life, to take it away.&quot;&quot;  (1 Kings 19:14,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In conclusion, no human ability, powers, talents, high
IQ, wonderful personality, none of these are substitutes for the controlling
ministry of the Holy Spirit. Believers just cannot please God in the energy of
the flesh, even though they may do many wonderful things! And you can’t buy
your way through to spirituality and you can’t work your way to becoming a
spiritual Christian.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sometimes ministers say, “I’m losing some of my members,
but if I could just get them to work.” They don’t need to work! They need to
walk in the Spirit. They need to confess their sins biblically and to mix the
promises of God with faith using faith-rest. Only by doing this will come
divine dynamics and activity and a very busy, balanced life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Many churches get into programs geared to entertain the
kids and amuse the adults. What they really need is the Word! The local church
is not a glorified country club or a lonely hearts club or a meeting place for
people who can’t get along with anyone else. So you cannot substitute human
dynamics for spiritual dynamics and get anywhere. The Word of God must be our only
criterion, not human hustle. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If there is a conflict between what you think and what
the Word of God says, then you are wrong! If there is a conflict between what
you experience and what the Word of God says, then you are wrong! The Word of
God is reality. Nothing can substitute for the controlling power of the Spirit
of God for the absolute state of spirituality!</p>
