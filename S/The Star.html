<h2>The Star</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Prophecy of the Star</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The star referenced in Numbers 24:17 is both the bright
star in the sky that led the wise men to the birthplace of the Savior Jesus
Christ and the Lord Jesus Christ Himself. The First Advent of the Star will
come out of Israel in this prophetic passage. “I see him, but not now” refers
to Balaam who was a believer, albeit a poor one, yet he prophesied that 1300
years in the future, the Star, the Savior will come to earth. God’s prophecies
always come true. His plan is always right on schedule.</p>

<p class=Verses>““I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not near; A star
shall come forth from Jacob, A scepter shall rise from Israel, And shall crush
through the forehead of Moab, And tear down all the sons of Sheth.”  (Numbers
24:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the Second Advent of Jesus Christ, the “scepter”
represents the authority of the King to set up His Kingdom in the Millennium.
At His Second Coming, our Lord will take care of the unbelievers first at the
battle of Armageddon. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Fulfillment of the Star</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 2:2, “His star” refers to the bright celestial
star that led the wise men to Christ’s birthplace. The celestial star reveled
the real Star - the Savior of mankind. The star led them. The star was composed
of light. Psalms 19:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of
Herod the king, magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem, saying, “Where is He
who has been born King of the Jews? For we saw His star in the east and have
come to worship Him.”“  (Matthew 2:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“ For the choir director. A Psalm of David. The heavens are
telling of the glory of God; And their expanse is declaring the work of His
hands.”  (Psalms 19:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The reality of the Star is that Jesus Christ as the Star,
revealed the plan of the Father and executed it. The Star Jesus Christ leads us
to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ. The Star Jesus Christ is the light of
the World. John 1:6-10. </p>

<p class=Verses>“There came a man sent from God, whose name was John. He came
as a witness, to testify about the Light, so that all might believe through
him. He was not the Light, but he came to testify about the Light. There was
the true Light which, coming into the world, enlightens every man. He was in
the world, and the world was made through Him, and the world did not know Him.” 
(John 1:6-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The significance of the Star is that He brought divine
wisdom to proclaim the message of the Star. And what is the message of the
star? A Savior has come to redeem mankind and to present Him as the light of
the world!</p>
