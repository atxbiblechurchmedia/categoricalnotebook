<h2>Spiritual Gifts, Tongues</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The spiritual gift of tongues was the ability of a person
to speak eloquently in a language without knowing that language. When speaking
in tongues, there was a great flow of words in the mind of the speaker, but the
vocabulary that came from their mouth was in a language they had never learned
to speak. The content of the gift of tongues was always the Gospel. This gift
was the ability to share the Gospel in a foreign language. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Tongues was not emotional gibberish or drunken speech. It
was a spiritual gift that functioned only under certain circumstances and
involved the Holy Spirit controlling the vocal cords so that the speaker
uttered a foreign language not previously known by the communicator, but known
to some unbeliever nearby who was listening. The use of the gift was a warning
to the Jews of the impending fifth cycle of discipline. The fifth cycle of
discipline for Israel transpired in 70 AD with the destruction of Jerusalem.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Greek word for tongue or a language is <i>glossa</i>
where we get the theological word glossophalia. This word combines the Greek
word <i>glossa</i> with the Greek word <i>phalia</i> which means speaking.
Therefore, glossophalia means to speak in another language or tongue. It simply
means the gift of foreign languages. <i>Glossa</i> means a common, everyday
language. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The word “tongue” in the New Testament, means a language
or dialect that someone else understands. The word “unknown” in the King James Version
of 1 Corinthians 14:4, is not found in the original manuscript. It is not in an
unknown tongue. The Christians in the early church who had this gift had a
supernatural gift to communicate in a language which they did not understand. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself;
but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 14:4, KJV)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;One who speaks in a tongue edifies himself; but one who
prophesies edifies the church.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 14:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The purpose of speaking in tongues was always to give the
Gospel. The content of tongues was always the Gospel and was only for
unbelievers. 1 Corinthians 14:21-22 is a quotation from Isaiah 28:11-12.
Tongues was a warning of the fifth cycle of discipline to the Jews.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;In the Law it is written, &quot;BY MEN OF STRANGE TONGUES
AND BY THE LIPS OF STRANGERS I WILL SPEAK TO THIS PEOPLE, AND EVEN SO THEY WILL
NOT LISTEN TO ME,&quot; says the Lord. So then tongues are for a sign, not to
those who believe but to unbelievers; but prophecy is for a sign, not to
unbelievers but to those who believe.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 14:21-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Indeed, He will speak to this people Through stammering
lips and a foreign tongue, He who said to them, &quot;Here is rest, give rest
to the weary,&quot; And, &quot;Here is repose,&quot; but they would not
listen.&quot;  (Isaiah 28:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Tongues was never necessary for salvation. Tongues was
never a sign of spirituality. 1 Cor. 12:3, 1 Cor. 12:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the
Spirit of God says, &quot;Jesus is accursed&quot;; and no one can say,
&quot;Jesus is Lord,&quot; except by the Holy Spirit.&quot;  (1 Corinthians
12:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But one and the same Spirit works all these things,
distributing to each one individually just as He wills.&quot;  (1 Corinthians
12:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>First Uses of Tongues </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The gift of tongues was the first spiritual gift to be
used on the day of Pentecost. The use of tongues on the day of Pentecost was
evangelism. The operation of tongues was a warning of the fifth cycle of
discipline to Israel. 1 Cor. 14:22. Because tongues was the first gift used, it
does not imply that it was the most important. 1 Cor. 12:28 says it is least of
all spiritual gifts.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And God has appointed in the church, first apostles,
second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps,
administrations, various kinds of tongues.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 12:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jerusalem was filled with many people who spoke many
languages on the Day of Pentecost. Religious unbelievers had come for the holy
days. A language barrier existed which was overcome by the gift of tongues.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first occurrence of the gift of tongues is presented
in Acts 2:1-4. All the disciples were gathered in one place waiting for the Day
of Pentecost. As Jews, they knew the Jewish timetable of the feasts. It was now
the feast of Pentecost and they knew that was the sign of the beginning of
God’s divine discipline to Israel. When the tongues or languages were
distributed along with the indwelling and filling with the Holy Spirit, they
began to speak in foreign languages. Remember that these disciples were uneducated
Jews from Galilee who spoke only their native language of Aramaic with a bit of
Hebrew they had learned. They did not know Gentile languages.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When the day of Pentecost had come, they were all
together in one place. And suddenly there came from heaven a noise like a
violent rushing wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.
And there appeared to them tongues as of fire distributing themselves, and they
rested on each one of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and
began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit was giving them
utterance.&quot;  (Acts 2:1-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Acts 2:5-11 describes the audience. During the time when
the first four feasts were celebrated (Passover, Unleavened Bread, First
Fruits, and Pentecost), Jerusalem always had a tremendous number of Jews,
visiting from Africa and Turkey, Greece and Rome, even India and China. At this
time, many were Jewish unbelievers.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now there were Jews living in Jerusalem, devout men from
every nation under heaven. And when this sound occurred, the crowd came
together, and were bewildered because each one of them was hearing them speak
in his own language. They were amazed and astonished, saying, &quot;Why, are
not all these who are speaking Galileans? &quot;And how is it that we each hear
them in our own language to which we were born? &quot;Parthians and Medes and
Elamites, and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,
Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the districts of Libya around Cyrene, and
visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabs—we hear them in
our own tongues speaking of the mighty deeds of God.&quot;&quot;  (Acts 2:5-11,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>These devout Jews had moved to Jerusalem. When this sound
occurred, the crowd of Jewish pilgrims came together and were thrown into
confusion because they were each hearing the first Church Age believers speak
in their own Gentile language. They were astonished at this because they knew
those who spoke their language were uneducated Galileans. They were amazed at
how they could hear them speaking their native languages of the Parthians or
Persians, Medes, Elamites or Akkadians, residents of Mesopotamia who spoke
Assyrian and Babylonian, residents of Judea who spoke Hebrew and Cappadocia who
spoke old Hittite, residents of Pontus and the Roman province of Asia who spoke
the language of Phrygia, residents of Pamphylia, residents of Egypt who spoke
Egyptian, Coptic and Arabic, the districts of Libya around Cyrene or northern
Africa, visitors from Rome who spoke Latin, both Jews and Cretans and Arabs who
spoke five different dialects. These Jews were told that Jesus Christ was the
God of Israel and that the Messiah had come and would go to the Cross and was
judged for all the sins of the world. This is an example of how the gift of
tongues had doctrinal content even from the beginning.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>With all those different languages being spoken at the
same time, it sounded very confusing to one approaching - almost like
stammering or stuttering. To those negative to the Gospel, it sounded like
drunkenness and slurred speech. Peter cleared up this misunderstanding in Acts
2:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;For these men are not drunk, as you suppose, for it
is only the third hour of the day;&quot;  (Acts 2:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 10:44-48, Peter had heard about the Gentile
Pentecost. While Peter was still talking, those who were listening to the
message received the Holy Spirit. The Jewish believers who were with Peter were
amazed because the Gentiles had also received the gift of tongues. They heard
the Gentile believers speak in foreign languages. The gift of tongues was first
given to Jewish believers and then to Gentile believers. Acts 19:2-7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy
Spirit fell upon all those who were listening to the message. All the
circumcised believers who came with Peter were amazed, because the gift of the
Holy Spirit had been poured out on the Gentiles also. For they were hearing
them speaking with tongues and exalting God. Then Peter answered, &quot;Surely
no one can refuse the water for these to be baptized who have received the Holy
Spirit just as we did, can he?&quot; And he ordered them to be baptized in the
name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay on for a few days.&quot; 
(Acts 10:44-48, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The religious unbelievers are the hardest to reach,
especially Jewish unbelievers. They are the hardest nuts to crack. They had all
come to Jerusalem for the holy days. There all the religious unsaved Jews
gathered and there was a tremendous barrier. How was it going to be penetrated?
It was to be penetrated through the gift of tongues. This was the sign of
tongues and the prophecy of tongues. Tongues was used by God to evangelize
these hard-headed religious Jews. Though there were many who would reject Christ
as their Savior, there were still 3,000 saved on the Day of Pentecost. The
barrier was penetrated. It was overcome by the gift of tongues.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Legitimate Use of the Gift of Tongues</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The purpose of tongues was only to communicate the
Gospel. The Holy Spirit guided the person in the use of tongues, as it was for
evangelism. The individual, on his own, did not know when to use the gift. God
the Holy Spirit knew when unbelievers were present and would motivate the
believer with the spiritual gift to put the gift into operation. He would
control the believer only while they were filled with the Holy Spirit. This believer
would choose either to follow the leading of the Spirit or reject His leading. Prayer
in tongues was bona fide only under conditions of someone receiving Christ as
Savior. The prayer was offered in tongues, the evangelism being in tongues. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The legitimate use of the gift of tongues was speaking
the Gospel in a foreign language understood by at least three people. Further,
no more than three should speak in tongues in any single gathering. Further,
they should do it in order. This was wherever people gathered to hear. It was
in congregations, in open fields, and in meeting places. This was true no
matter what the evangelistic setting, whether it was personal evangelism, a
group of unbelievers, whether it was out of doors or in a church building. 1
Cor. 14:26-28.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;What is the outcome then, brethren? When you assemble,
each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an
interpretation. Let all things be done for edification. If anyone speaks in a
tongue, it should be by two or at the most three, and each in turn, and one
must interpret; but if there is no interpreter, he must keep silent in the
church; and let him speak to himself and to God.&quot;  (1 Corinthians
14:26-28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At least one of the three had to be an unbeliever that
needed to hear the Gospel in his own tongue. Another of the three had to be a
believer with the gift of tongues. The third had to have the gift of
interpretation of tongues. The target of the gift of tongues was always the one
being evangelized. There was great power when speaking in tongues. There was a
great flow of words in the mind of the speaker. The believer who possessed this
temporary spiritual gift had the vocabulary come out of his mouth when he did
not even know what he was saying.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The local churches met primarily in homes up to the fifth
century AD. They met wherever a group would gather to hear the Word. They never
met in a so-called church or religious building until the advent of
Catholicism. It may have been one of the worst things to happen to
Christianity. If people today came to a home or some type of study that was
very relaxed, not something beautiful and appealing to one's esthetic side, the
issue would more likely be clearly taught Bible doctrine. Instead, in many churches,
they appeal to the emotions with colorful stained glass, pipe organs, and
beautiful classical music as a preliminary to some worship services. Worship of
God should be very informal and non-ritualistic. That's the beauty of having
Bible study in homes. Every denomination in the United States recorded a
significant loss in membership and attendance in recent years. What an open
market we have today to evangelize and share Bible doctrine with those who
might be positive.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>With the church meeting in homes until the fifth century
AD, those early centuries were the most powerful, the most fruitful, and the
most productive as far as outreach was concerned in both evangelism and
missionary activity. In a church service in the period between 30 and 70 AD,
God the Holy Spirit motivated certain Christians who were Spirit-filled to get
up and give the Gospel to unbelievers in the group in a foreign language. God
the Holy Spirit knew there were unbelievers there who needed to hear the Gospel
in their own dialect.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer with the gift of tongues, whether in
Jerusalem or somewhere else, would think the Gospel very quickly, stand up and
open his mouth and lo and behold, he gave all Gospel information in Koine,
maybe in Hebrew or Aramaic, Latin or whatever was indigenous to the people to
whom he was speaking. Apparently, the gift of tongues was always the eloquent
use of the idiom of another language. Generally, it was a common presentation,
the language of the street, and that is what the Greek word <i>glossa</i>
implies. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The person with the gift of tongues would not get up and
tell the unbeliever he was spiritually dead. He would not tell them that Adam's
original sin had been imputed to their Old Sin Nature and that they needed
regeneration and propitiation. It was not something that was eloquent in
technical theological language. The Greek word <i>glossa</i> means, common,
everyday language. So much so that Paul dipped into the language of the gutter
in Galatians 5:10-18 really to make a point. The Galatians had been saved by grace
through faith and justification by faith. Nevertheless, they had apostatized
and had rebelled against salvation by grace and believed they were saved by
keeping the Mosaic Law with a big emphasis on the men being circumcised. Paul
told them that if they thought circumcision had anything to do with salvation,
then they should go ahead and emasculate themselves like some priests did in
that day. That's the language of the gutter. That really communicates the point
of doctrine. There was not a person in the Galatian church who did not know
what Paul was saying. He was using the common everyday idiom of the streets.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I have confidence in you in the Lord that you will adopt
no other view; but the one who is disturbing you will bear his judgment,
whoever he is. But I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still
persecuted? Then the stumbling block of the cross has been abolished. I wish
that those who are troubling you would even mutilate themselves. For you were
called to freedom, brethren; only do not turn your freedom into an opportunity
for the flesh, but through love serve one another. For the whole Law is
fulfilled in one word, in the statement, &quot;YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS
YOURSELF.&quot; But if you bite and devour one another, take care that you are
not consumed by one another. But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not
carry out the desire of the flesh. For the flesh sets its desire against the
Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are in opposition to one
another, so that you may not do the things that you please. But if you are led
by the Spirit, you are not under the Law.&quot;  (Galatians 5:10-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Those with the gift of tongues always gave the Gospel in
the eloquent use of another language. This eloquence produced fantastic
stimulation in the emotion, from which the speaker had a soulish response. The
emotions are in the soul. The emotional response had nothing to do with his
being Spirit-filled. It had nothing to do with the content of the Gospel
information in the human spirit and resident in the speaker’s soul. The emotion
was a response to all of that fantastic grace function.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Misuse of Tongues and Emotionalism in Corinth </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Corinthians had made tongues, the least of all
spiritual gifts, the most important. They thought of it as the badge of spirituality.
It was a very stimulating thing to the emotions of the believer to use the gift
of tongues. This would often produce ecstatics and these ecstatics would
confuse the Corinthians. Here is where the abuse of tongues occurred.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Corinthians made speaking in tongues the basis for
spirituality and the spiritual life. It was confusing to them and to others in
the congregation who desired the emotion and the ecstatics. They were making
emotion the criterion for spirituality which meant they were not filled with
the Holy Spirit and behaving as though they were unbelievers. This was
confusing to the believers and unbelievers alike. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 Corinthians 2:13-14 says that unbelievers are natural
which is body and soul only. Believers are body, soul, and human spirit.
Unbelievers cannot understand Bible principles because learning God’s Word
requires the filling of the Holy Spirit. Only believers have this.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;which things we also speak, not in words taught by human
wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, combining spiritual thoughts with
spiritual words. But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of
God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because
they are spiritually appraised.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 2:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>From the soul, you can have emotional activity so much so
that the emotions can control the soul. That's what happens to Christians who
make emotion the criteria for spiritual life, rather than Bible doctrine. What
we need to be is not natural people, but spiritual people who have God the Holy
Spirit controlling the soul, feeding on the Word of God every day, and having
just a very natural, normal bona fide emotional response as a result of our
spiritual growth.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What's the explanation for believers who allegedly speak
in tongues? Emotion. Pseudo-tongues from the believer is the expression of
emotional arrogance. 2 Corinthians 6:11-12 is a warning against emotional
revolt of the soul. Paul preached to them accurately, but they had been
hindered by their own emotions or affections.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Our mouth has spoken freely to you, O Corinthians, our
heart is opened wide. You are not restrained by us, but you are restrained in
your own affections.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 6:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Emotion is not a part of spirituality. Emotion is related
to the physiological function of the human body, not the human spirit. Under
extreme emotion, anyone can cause strange sounds to come from their mouths.
Believers are commanded to separate from emotional legalists, do-gooders, holy
rollers, the tongues crowd, and everyone who uses their emotion rather than
doctrine as a criterion for the spiritual life. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 16:17-18, Paul is urging fellow believers to
look out for those who are causing dissensions or splits in churches and
apostasies contrary to Bible doctrine. He is telling them to turn away from the
emotional crowd because such believers in emotionalism are not slaves to the
Lord Jesus Christ, but slaves to their own emotions. In this state, they
deceive ignorant believers with their smooth and flattering speech. Emotionalism
is not spirituality. The ecstatics and emotions which came from the use of
tongues in leading the person to Christ were confused with spirituality by the
Corinthians, and therefore not beneficial. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now I urge you, brethren, keep your eye on those who
cause dissensions and hindrances contrary to the teaching which you learned,
and turn away from them. For such men are slaves, not of our Lord Christ but of
their own appetites; and by their smooth and flattering speech they deceive the
hearts of the unsuspecting.&quot;  (Romans 16:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Two unfortunate results from the practice of tongues
today are that it obscures the Gospel, therefore keeping the unbeliever from
finding Jesus Christ today. It also leads believers into false doctrine and
prevents spiritual growth and divine good production. Knowledge of doctrine is
at a minimum with people involved in tongues today.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A warning is given in 1 Timothy 4:1-2 and 1 Timothy 4:16
regarding the doctrine of demons. The command to grow in grace orientation and <i>epignosis</i>
knowledge or Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the soul. <i>Gnosis</i>
transferred from the mind by faith to the right lobe of the soul will build an
edification complex and keep the believer out of emotional revolt. 2 Peter
3:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some
will fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and
doctrines of demons, by means of the hypocrisy of liars seared in their own
conscience as with a branding iron,&quot;  (1 Timothy 4:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Pay close attention to yourself and to your teaching;
persevere in these things, for as you do this you will ensure salvation both
for yourself and for those who hear you.&quot;  (1 Timothy 4:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and
Savior Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory, both now and to the day of eternity.
Amen.&quot;  (2 Peter 3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>2 Corinthians 6:11-12 links the false practice of tongues
in Corinth with emotionalism. The modern emphasis on tongues is also false. In
unbelievers, it is demon possession. In believers at best, it is a
psychological or emotional reaction. The phrase “Our mouth has spoken freely to
you” refers to Paul teaching them Bible doctrine. The phrase “our heart (mind)
is opened wide” refers to Paul’s soul was full of Bible doctrine in frame of
reference, conscience, and viewpoint when he taught Bible class. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Our mouth has spoken freely to you, O Corinthians, our
heart is opened wide. You are not restrained by us, but you are restrained in
your own affections.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 6:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He taught, but they would not listen. Why? Their emotions
were in control of their souls rather than the Holy Spirit being in control.
They were in emotional revolt of the soul. The Corinthians had let tongues
become their primary criterion rather than Bible doctrine in their souls. They
strove for the emotional experience of speaking in tongues rather than growing
in the spiritual life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The False Use of Tongues Today</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The practice of tongues today is either emotional or
ecstatic involvement or demon possession. The practice of tongues today is the
worst manifestation of the apostacy of our times. Not one divine good work has
come through this movement. Such false practice limits the believers’ spiritual
growth by emphasizing their feelings and emotions rather than Bible doctrine. 2
Cor. 6:11-12, 1 Tim. 4:1-2, 1 Tim. 4:16. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Our mouth has spoken freely to you, O Corinthians, our
heart is opened wide. You are not restrained by us, but you are restrained in
your own affections.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 6:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some
will fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and
doctrines of demons, by means of the hypocrisy of liars seared in their own
conscience as with a branding iron,&quot;  (1 Timothy 4:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Pay close attention to yourself and to your teaching;
persevere in these things, for as you do this you will ensure salvation both
for yourself and for those who hear you.&quot;  (1 Timothy 4:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Why the practice of tongues today - these “deceitful
spirits and doctrines of demons?” One answer. Bible doctrine has not been
taught categorically from our pulpits. Instead, there has been the substitution
of programs and endless evangelistic messages to evangelize again the already
evangelized, and schemes to bring in the bodies to grow their church. The
practice of tongues obscures the Gospel for the unbeliever and keeps the
believer from growing spiritually. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Such programs and schemes triggers a vacuum in the soul
of the immature or negative believer who is in emotional revolt. Instead of
drawing in Bible doctrine, they are attracted to false systems of Bible
doctrine and emotionalism such as tongues. The individual on emotional revolt
always rejects the authority of a pastor in a local church and is a
troublemaker. They are negative to Bible doctrine and have a vacuum in their
souls that pulls in false teaching.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A wide-spread condition of this sort in Christendom does
much more damage to the cause of Christ than liberalism. Liberalism is by and
large promoted by the unbelieving religious type. But this cancer, described
above, is carried on by apostate believers who worship in high places. They are
never grace-oriented, they are constantly restless, and they are reactors
instead of responders. They claim to be authorities unto themselves, always
witch hunters, always smelling out what they claim to be false doctrine, but
only deluding themselves. We are to separate from people practicing tongues
today. Rom. 16:17-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now I urge you, brethren, keep your eye on those who
cause dissensions and hindrances contrary to the teaching which you learned,
and turn away from them. For such men are slaves, not of our Lord Christ but of
their own appetites; and by their smooth and flattering speech they deceive the
hearts of the unsuspecting.&quot;  (Romans 16:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Perspective of Tongues</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fact that the gift of tongues was the first gift
given by the Holy Spirit on the Day of Pentecost does not mean that it was the
most important gift. In the Pre-Canon period of the Church Age, especially from
30 to 70 AD, the emphasis was on spectacular, temporary supernatural gifts such
as apostleship, prophecy, miracles, healing, and the gift of speaking in
different languages or tongues. Tongues is the very last on the list. This is
the very gift the charismatics make number one. Paul puts it last in 1
Corinthians 12:28. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And God has appointed in the church, first apostles,
second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps,
administrations, various kinds of tongues.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 12:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is the least gift in order of importance. Tongues is
the last gift listed. Unusual activities took place in the Book of Acts. Acts
presents the early history of the Church Age which was a transitional period
from the Age of the Jews to the Church Age. All of this information must be
regarded in light of the fact that the Canon of Scripture was not yet completed
or circulated.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The purpose of the gift of tongues was evangelism and is
also mentioned in 1 Corinthians 14:9-12. Therefore, during this period of the
Book of Acts, we have this great crash program called temporary spiritual
gifts. It was a stopgap measure to take up the slack which later would be taken
up permanently, completely and eternally by the Word of God in the completed written
Bible.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So also you, unless you utter by the tongue speech that
is clear, how will it be known what is spoken? For you will be speaking into
the air. There are, perhaps, a great many kinds of languages in the world, and
no kind is without meaning. If then I do not know the meaning of the language,
I will be to the one who speaks a barbarian, and the one who speaks will be a
barbarian to me. So also you, since you are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek to
abound for the edification of the church.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 14:9-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The gift of tongues was discontinued in 70 AD with the
fall of Jerusalem, when the Jews went out under the fifth cycle of discipline
and entered into their worldwide dispersion because of their continual
rejection of Christ. In perspective, the gift of tongues was used to warn of
that event. This was both a warning to the Jews and to evangelize them. We see
in 1 Corinthians 14:14-22, that tongues were a sign, not for believers, but the
Jewish unbelievers in Jerusalem.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind
is unfruitful. What is the outcome then? I will pray with the spirit and I will
pray with the mind also; I will sing with the spirit and I will sing with the
mind also. Otherwise if you bless in the spirit only, how will the one who
fills the place of the ungifted say the &quot;Amen&quot; at your giving of
thanks, since he does not know what you are saying? For you are giving thanks
well enough, but the other person is not edified. I thank God, I speak in tongues
more than you all; however, in the church I desire to speak five words with my
mind so that I may instruct others also, rather than ten thousand words in a
tongue. Brethren, do not be children in your thinking; yet in evil be infants,
but in your thinking be mature. In the Law it is written, &quot;BY MEN OF
STRANGE TONGUES AND BY THE LIPS OF STRANGERS I WILL SPEAK TO THIS PEOPLE, AND
EVEN SO THEY WILL NOT LISTEN TO ME,&quot; says the Lord. So then tongues are
for a sign, not to those who believe but to unbelievers; but prophecy is for a
sign, not to unbelievers but to those who believe.&quot;  (1 Corinthians
14:14-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The proper perspective of tongues must be based the
consistent correct teaching from the Word of God in Bible class rather than the
apparent sincerity of those believers caught under false teaching. It doesn't
matter how sincere they sound, what they say, what they do, or how they say
they use tongues as a personal worship for the Lord. Tongues was never designed
for that purpose. It was a public gift. It was to be used in the public setting
of the local church in giving the Gospel to an unbeliever. If there was no one
to interpret, they were not to speak in tongues. They were to stay in their
seats and think the Gospel through without speaking it aloud. We must remember
the proper perspective on the gift of tongues. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Old Testament Prophecy of Tongues</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The beginning of the prophesy of tongues was with
Isaiah’s warning of the impending destruction (Fifth Cycle of Discipline) of
the Southern Kingdom of Israel. Isaiah’s prophecies also applied to the
Northern Kingdom which was spiritually degenerating the same way due to
national negative volition to the Word of God. Isaiah 28:8-12 describes some of
the degeneracy of the Northern Kingdom of Israel.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For all the tables are full of filthy vomit, without a
single clean place. &quot;To whom would He teach knowledge, And to whom would
He interpret the message? Those just weaned from milk? Those just taken from
the breast? &quot;For He says, 'Order on order, order on order, Line on line,
line on line, A little here, a little there.'&quot; Indeed, He will speak to
this people Through stammering lips and a foreign tongue, He who said to them,
&quot;Here is rest, give rest to the weary,&quot; And, &quot;Here is
repose,&quot; but they would not listen.&quot;  (Isaiah 28:8-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The prophets and priests had very few to teach doctrine
to because of the widespread negative volition. This national degeneracy was
causing God’s divine discipline to their client nation to be increased to get
them to understand the error of their ways and to return to God’s plan for
their individual lives. They did not. Isaiah wrote that the only hope was in
the children because the adults were indifferent to the spiritual life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Alcoholism was prevalent in the Northern Kingdom of
Israel. The majority of the Jewish population was drunk most of the time and
had continual slurred speech due to their inebriated state. As a client nation,
God had instructed them to send out missionaries to convert the Gentiles around
them. They failed to do so. Instead of giving the Gospel to unbelieving
Gentiles, they were drunk and had slurred speech which sounded like a Gentile
language instead of their own clear, concise, and smooth flowing Hebrew. The
Northern Kingdom was about to be destroyed by the Assyrians and the Southern
Kingdom would soon be destroyed by Chaldea. In Isaiah 28:11, “Indeed, He will
speak to this people through stammering lips and a foreign tongue” speaks of
the last Jewish client nation, Judea, and the clear warning it would receive
before its destruction. Judea was destroyed in 70 AD by Rome.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Hearing the Gospel communicated in a foreign or Gentile
language was to be the warning to the Jews in the last client nation of Judea
that they were going to be under a double curse and about to be destroyed due
to national negative volition and spiritual degeneracy. The double curse was
spiritual death for the negative believers in that nation plus the fifth cycle
of discipline for the nation due to the number of negative believers in the
nation. This was the prophecy for the temporary gift of tongues. Tongues was
used to evangelize Jews in Gentile languages. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Because the Jews failed to go to the Gentiles as
missionaries, the gift of tongues or Gentile languages was used to evangelize
the Jews. This was fulfilled on the Day of Pentecost. That was the beginning of
the warning that the Jew’s nation would be destroyed by God’s discipline to
their nation. Judea would cease to exist and would never exist again until the
Second Advent of Jesus Christ. From 30 to 70 AD, the Jews were evangelized by
the gift of tongues. This gift came to a very sudden close in August of 70 AD
when Jerusalem was overrun and destroyed by the Romans.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Though Jews traveled widely as merchants, they hated the
Assyrians. Jonah was a good example. Although God told their missionaries to go
to Assyria to evangelize them, most went elsewhere. The few missionaries that
did go there resulted in thousands being saved which changed the course of
Assyrian history. Jonah illustrates this in Jonah 3:1-5 and Jonah 3:10. This
positive response to the Gospel only made Jonah mad such that he went out and
sulked for days. How God dealt with his sin is the story of the worm and the
gourd or plant in Jonah 4:1-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now the word of the LORD came to Jonah the second time,
saying, &quot;Arise, go to Nineveh the great city and proclaim to it the
proclamation which I am going to tell you.&quot; So Jonah arose and went to
Nineveh according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceedingly great
city, a three days' walk. Then Jonah began to go through the city one day's
walk; and he cried out and said, &quot;Yet forty days and Nineveh will be
overthrown.&quot; Then the people of Nineveh believed in God; and they called a
fast and put on sackcloth from the greatest to the least of them.&quot;  (Jonah
3:1-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When God saw their deeds, that they turned from their
wicked way, then God relented concerning the calamity which He had declared He
would bring upon them. And He did not do it.&quot;  (Jonah 3:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jonah was typical of Jewish missionary activity. Very few
missionaries went out. Those few who went out were highly successful because
God sent them to places where the people were literally waiting for the Gospel
message. Isaiah prophesied the destruction of all three Jewish client nations:
the Northern Kingdom, the Southern Kingdom, and Judea at around 725 BC when
Isaiah 28 was written. The Jews sought signs and Isaiah was the great prophet
of signs. Isaiah warned of the coming of the fifth cycle of discipline which
would occur four years later to the Northern Kingdom. From the alcoholic
slurred speech of the drunks of Israel came the speech warning of the future,
the warning of the fifth cycle of discipline through the spiritual gift of
tongues during the first years of the Church Age.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Just as drunken speech was a warning in 725 BC, so the gift
of tongues would be a warning on the Day of Pentecost and thereafter for 40
years until the fall of Israel. Interestingly enough, those who spoke in
tongues on the Day of Pentecost were considered drunk by the crowds. So
drunkenness was in the prophecy and drunkenness was alleged though not true in
the fulfillment of the prophecy. Isaiah 28:11 was so important that it was
quoted by Paul in the tongues passage in 1 Corinthians 14:21-22.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Indeed, He will speak to this people Through stammering
lips and a foreign tongue,&quot;  (Isaiah 28:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;In the Law it is written, &quot;BY MEN OF STRANGE TONGUES
AND BY THE LIPS OF STRANGERS I WILL SPEAK TO THIS PEOPLE, AND EVEN SO THEY WILL
NOT LISTEN TO ME,&quot; says the Lord. So then tongues are for a sign, not to
those who believe but to unbelievers; but prophecy is for a sign, not to
unbelievers but to those who believe.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 14:21-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Isaiah 28:11 presents the fulfillment of the sign or
prophecy of tongues. This prophecy was given in the overall context of God's
judgment being visited upon the Northern Kingdom. Isaiah prophesied that Israel
would be conquered by a foreign nation. It would be a nation that spoke a
faltering and stammering tongue or language when compared to the beautiful flow
of Hebrew. This prophecy concerned the Assyrians. The Assyrians, a Gentile
people, speaking a language that the Jews did not speak, would come in and
conquer the Northern Kingdom. They would destroy them and would remove them
from their lands and put them into slavery under the fifth cycle of discipline.
The Southern Kingdom of Judah would be put under the fourth cycle of
discipline.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The prophecy in Isaiah 28:11 deals with a future event when
foreigners or Gentiles would come and present the Gospel to the Gentiles living
in the nation of Israel in a language other than Hebrew. In this way, God is
going to speak to His ancient people in Israel in Gentile languages. This
prophecy concerns the Jews being judged by Gentiles speaking in Gentile
languages.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Three Different Operations of the Gift of Tongues</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The gift of tongues operated three different ways. One
way involved preaching the Gospel to groups of unbelievers because tongues was
for unbelievers, not believers. The content for the gift of tongues was always
the Gospel. The second way involved someone praying in tongues. The third way
was when someone was singing in tongues. The believer often thought the Gospel
and was motivated to sing the message. 1 Cor. 14:14-15.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind
is unfruitful. What is the outcome then? I will pray with the spirit and I will
pray with the mind also; I will sing with the spirit and I will sing with the
mind also.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 14:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We don't know if the Holy Spirit provided the melody as
well as the lyrics in a foreign language. It's possible He provided both. The
most probable way was the believer with the gift of tongues using common folk
melodies to present the Gospel. Under the power of the Holy Spirit, they would
use psalms, Gospel songs, and testimony songs and stand up and sing in tongues.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The charismatics do that in our own day and age, but when
they get up, it's gibberish. They do not interpret or have someone else to
interpret, because it is not in any known language at all. 1 Corinthians
14:26-28 says that if more than one with the gift of tongues were motivated to
share the Gospel message, there should be two or at most three who decide to do
it and each should do it in turn. Most importantly, they should let someone
with the gift of interpretation of tongues interpret, but if there is no
interpreter present, then they should all refrain from speaking in tongues in
the church. Whether it's preaching, praying or singing, the believer speaking
in tongues had to have someone else with the gift of interpretation to provide
the interpretation.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;What is the outcome then, brethren? When you assemble,
each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an
interpretation. Let all things be done for edification. If anyone speaks in a
tongue, it should be by two or at the most three, and each in turn, and one
must interpret; but if there is no interpreter, he must keep silent in the
church; and let him speak to himself and to God.&quot;  (1 Corinthians
14:26-28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul says, in 1 Corinthians 14:15, that he would pray
with his spirit which is motivation and enthusiasm. He also said that he would
also pray with his mind. In other words, Paul knows how to pray, to whom to
pray, in whose name, and in whose power. He knows the difference between
thanksgiving, intercession, and petition in worshiping the Lord in prayer. You
must understand the doctrine of prayer before your prayer life will be
meaningful. Paul also says he would sing with his spirit and with his mind. You
do that when you sing a song that you really feel attached to and produces
great blessing and emotional response. Beyond this response in your mind, you
should know what those words mean, the message they are conveying, and how they
apply to your life. In other words, when you sing the doctrinal lyrics, you
should know what they mean so your emotions can have a bona fide response.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;What is the outcome then? I will pray with the spirit and
I will pray with the mind also; I will sing with the spirit and I will sing
with the mind also.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 14:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul was dealing with people within the worship service
that included unbelievers. Therefore, the preaching would be in tongues,
praying in tongues, or the Gospel would be sung in tongues. This was during the
worship service. The gift of tongues was never given for comfort or consolation
or a personal worship experience. Many Pentecostals wrongly use this as their
basis today. What encouragement, and consolation could you get from completely
incomprehensible jabbering to each other? Encouragement, comfort, and
consolation come only from the Word of God. The Word of God is the basis for
our consolation, not some temporary spiritual gift which we seek after to
produce all kinds of ecstatic activities. The Gospel was always the content of
the message, whether, prayed or sung. It was never for anything other than the
Gospel!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Cessation of the Gift of Tongues</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The gift of tongues was the first temporary spiritual
gift to cease. It was removed in 70 AD with the destruction of Jerusalem. 1
Corinthians 13:8-10 shows us that this gift was temporary and ceased to
function because its purpose was over. The “perfect” is the completed written Canon
of Scripture. The “partial” are the temporary spiritual gifts. They were no
longer needed once the Canon of Scripture was written and disseminated
throughout the Roman Empire.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Love never fails; but if there are gifts of prophecy,
they will be done away; if there are tongues, they will cease; if there is
knowledge, it will be done away. For we know in part and we prophesy in part;
but when the perfect comes, the partial will be done away.&quot;  (1
Corinthians 13:8-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To understand why 70 AD, one must understand the five
cycles of divine discipline in Leviticus 26. Tongues were a sign of judgment to
Israel – that the fifth cycle of divine discipline from God was coming and to
facilitated a crash program of proclaiming the Gospel to the early church. Isaiah
28:10-13, 1 Cor. 14:21-22.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;For He says, 'Order on order, order on order, Line
on line, line on line, A little here, a little there.'&quot; Indeed, He will
speak to this people Through stammering lips and a foreign tongue, He who said
to them, &quot;Here is rest, give rest to the weary,&quot; And, &quot;Here is
repose,&quot; but they would not listen. So the word of the LORD to them will
be, &quot;Order on order, order on order, Line on line, line on line, A little
here, a little there,&quot; That they may go and stumble backward, be broken,
snared and taken captive.&quot;  (Isaiah 28:10-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;In the Law it is written, &quot;BY MEN OF STRANGE TONGUES
AND BY THE LIPS OF STRANGERS I WILL SPEAK TO THIS PEOPLE, AND EVEN SO THEY WILL
NOT LISTEN TO ME,&quot; says the Lord. So then tongues are for a sign, not to
those who believe but to unbelievers; but prophecy is for a sign, not to
unbelievers but to those who believe.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 14:21-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The prophecy of tongues had been fulfilled at that point
in time. From 30 to 70 AD, the Jews had 40 years of maximum, spectacular
evangelism in Jerusalem. Jerusalem had been evangelized through supernatural
abilities such as tongues, interpretation of tongues, healings, miracles, and
other signs and wonders. People even came by and touched the hem of Peter's
robe to be healed. Handkerchiefs were distributed and by touching one, people
were healed.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The responsibility of the nation of Israel was the
development and custodianship of the Old Testament Scriptures, doctrinal
teaching within the nation, and evangelism of other nations (Gentile) through
missionary activity. Even though Jews traveled extensively as merchants making
money, they did not send out missionaries to evangelize the Gentiles, as they
should have.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The experience today called the gift of tongues is really
pseudo tongues and is either demon possession when it involves unbelievers, or
demon influence, or emotionalism. In believers, it is not demon possession, but
demon influence or emotionalism. 2 Thess. 2:7-12. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only
he who now restrains will do so until he is taken out of the way. Then that
lawless one will be revealed whom the Lord will slay with the breath of His
mouth and bring to an end by the appearance of His coming; that is, the one
whose coming is in accord with the activity of Satan, with all power and signs
and false wonders, and with all the deception of wickedness for those who
perish, because they did not receive the love of the truth so as to be saved.
For this reason God will send upon them a deluding influence so that they will
believe what is false, in order that they all may be judged who did not believe
the truth, but took pleasure in wickedness.&quot;  (2 Thessalonians 2:7-12,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The mechanics of pseudo tongues is found in Isaiah 8:19,
Isaiah 29:4, and illustrated by Revelation 16:13-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When they say to you, &quot;Consult the mediums and the
spiritists who whisper and mutter,&quot; should not a people consult their God?
Should they consult the dead on behalf of the living?&quot;  (Isaiah 8:19,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then you will be brought low; From the earth you will
speak, And from the dust where you are prostrate Your words will come. Your
voice will also be like that of a spirit from the ground, And your speech will
whisper from the dust.&quot;  (Isaiah 29:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon and out
of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three
unclean spirits like frogs; for they are spirits of demons, performing signs,
which go out to the kings of the whole world, to gather them together for the
war of the great day of God, the Almighty.&quot;  (Revelation 16:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Also, the extraordinary ability of a missionary or
linguist to master a foreign language and evangelize and edify is not the gift
of tongues. A person may be “gifted” in ability, but that is not the same as
the spiritual gift of tongues used between 30 and 70 AD. For believers not to
be biblically straight on the tongues issue is disastrous. It is the chief form
of apostacy today in so called evangelical Christianity. The tongues movement
within and without the holiness movement is horrible and the very worst sort of
empiricism. </p>
