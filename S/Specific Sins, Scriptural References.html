<h2>Specific Sins, Scriptural References</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Word of God has much to say about the specific sins
that pose certain and varied problems to the believer. In a day when so much
communication is relative, the absolute authoritative declarations of the text
of Scripture are necessary.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers in Jesus Christ are to make themselves
available to the categorical teaching of the Word of God that describes
specific sins and how they relate to the Christian way of life. For decades,
even centuries, there has been much confusion as to the difference between
taboos, stated sins, and “questionable things.” Many believers have had
problems knowing where they had liberty, what exactly does the Bible call sin,
and which sins seem to have the most attention given them in Scripture.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Within this study, over 200 specific sins are dealt with
from their meaning in the Greek and in the context in which they occur. Careful
study will result in the realization that exegetical categorical study has an even
more clear concept of the biblical teaching on sin than often those who make
sins the champion of their cause.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Principles Derived from Study of Specific Sins</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sins fall into different contexts in the Scripture where
they play different roles in the lives of people they affect. Sins basically
fall into three categories - mental attitude sins, sins of the tongue and overt
sins.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sins may be initiatory in their make-up. They may be the
thing that starts a chain reaction. Sins may be resultant meaning the product
of a foregoing condition. Specific sins will result in producing certain
“sinful states of being” or a status quo condition, such as carnality.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Specific sins may also result in a “progressive sinful
state of being,” the condition of reversionism as an example. Specific sins may
result in the believer being controlled by an “inherited sinful state.” By
inherited we mean a state or condition prevailing in the make-up of your own
old sin nature. Examples of these trends are lasciviousness or asceticism.
These are constant characteristic sinful principles always abiding in your old
sin nature and express themselves when you are out of fellowship.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is a parallelism between committing a sin and the
sinful state of being and the principle of confessing sin biblically and being
spiritual. Therefore we can conclude that when you commit a specific sin, it
puts you into a certain specific “sinful state of being.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is a relationship between the growth level of the
believer and the “sinful state of being” that they become ensnared in. The
growth capacity of the believer allows them greater depths of sinful pursuits.
A baby in human life can cause problems, a teenager can get into more complex
problems, but it takes an adult to really get strung up in the life process.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Specific sins always begin as mental sins. Mental
attitude sins injure the believer having them before they have any outward
expression. Others are injured by your mental attitude sins where they become
verbal or overt.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is possible to injure someone by your mental attitude
even without doing anything. This can be accomplished when you are reflecting
upon your “stand” on an issue in the audience of some “legalistic” believer who
has a taboo for the thing that you are positive to in your own mental attitude.
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Scriptural References for Specific Sins</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Psalms 19:13: Presumptuous sins. The areas of life
involved are thought life and volitional life. In Psalms 19, the sins fall into
the context of those things which man “fails to get full information on.”
Presumptuous sins are those of making premature conclusions based upon
incomplete evidence.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Also keep back Your servant from presumptuous sins; Let them
not rule over me; Then I will be blameless, And I shall be acquitted of great
transgression.” (Psalms 19:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Proverbs 6:17-18: pride, lying, personal-injury type,
wicked imaginations, eager mischief, lies regarding others, discord. The areas
of life involved are thought life, vocabulary life, and relationships to
people.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, And hands that shed innocent
blood, A heart that devises wicked plans, Feet that run rapidly to evil,”
(Proverbs 6:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Matthew: Judging, unjustified divorce, remarriage to
former wife having married in the meantime (Deut.), self-advancement, failure
to pray, injustice to others, unbelief in Jesus Christ. Matt. 19:27; Matt.
20:20. The areas of life involved are thought life, family life, married life,
ministry life, relationships to ethers, and relationship to Christ. In Matthew,
sins are found within the context of “abuses in the application of the Law
system.” They define and describe the human inaccuracy and inability to rightly
follow the responsibility laid down by God for them. They could be said to be
sins “coming short of the glory of God.”</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Peter said to Him, &quot;Behold, we have left everything
and followed You; what then will there be for us?&quot;” (Matthew 19:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to Jesus with her
sons, bowing down and making a request of Him.” (Matthew 20:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>John: Unbelief, failure to understand Scripture
previously known, false worship, misunderstanding of the person of Christ,
desiring a sign as proof for the word of Christ, murmuring, unbelief, adultery,
attempting to enter the plan of God by other means, or adding to the plan of
God, failure to understand cleansing, betraying another, decisions based on
expediency. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The areas of life involved are spiritual life, knowledge
life, worship life, faith life, thought life, and volitional life. In John, the
sins would fall into the context of negativism to the plan of God. This
expresses itself toward Christ in unbelief, toward people in murmuring, adultery,
betrayal of friends, toward decision in misusing the principle of expediency.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Romans 1:21-32: rejecting natural revelation of God,
worshipping created things, lesbianism, homosexuality, unrighteousness,
fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness, envy, murder, debate,
deceit, malignity, whisperers, backbiters, haters of God, spiteful, proud,
boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, without
understanding, covenant breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful,
have pleasure in others’ sin. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The areas of life involved are sex life, worship life,
thought life, family life, social life, and overt life. The Romans list
basically relates to sins that are a result of negative volition at the point
of God consciousness. The basic initiatory sin in Romans 1 is that of being
negative to natural revelation.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God
or give thanks, but they became futile in their speculations, and their foolish
heart was darkened. Professing to be wise, they became fools, and exchanged the
glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man and
of birds and four-footed animals and crawling creatures. Therefore God gave
them over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, so that their bodies would
be dishonored among them.” (Romans 1:21-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 Corinthians 3:3-4: jealousy, strife. The areas of life
involved are church life and fellowship life. The Corinthian context is that of
believers in the church who are carnal with all of its expressions as a result
of a lack of spiritual growth. Another factor involving sin in the Corinthian
context was that of misusing Truth or the wrong application of it.</p>

<p class=Verses>“for you are still fleshly. For since there is jealousy and
strife among you, are you not fleshly, and are you not walking like mere men?
For when one says, &quot;I am of Paul,&quot; and another, &quot;I am of
Apollos,&quot; are you not mere men?” (1 Corinthians 3:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 Corinthians 8:9-10: Misuse of the law of liberty is
sin. The areas of life involved are responsibilities in life, giving, and
personal relationships.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But take care that this liberty of yours does not somehow
become a stumbling block to the weak. For if someone sees you, who have
knowledge, dining in an idol's temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak,
be strengthened to eat things sacrificed to idols?” (1 Corinthians 8:9-10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>2 Corinthians: Giving out of necessity, practice of
comparative spirituality, judging things on the outward appearance, challenging
the authority of those over you, failure to recognize God’s measure of ministry
for you. The areas of life involved are giving life, spiritual life,
relationships to others, station in life under authority, ministry life. In 2
Corinthians, sins find themselves in the context of “improper approach to
spiritual evaluation,” wrong appraisal of giving, wrong principle of evaluating
spiritual consistency, wrong basis and criteria for approval, and wrong view of
authority.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Galatians 5:19-21: Immorality, impurity, sensuality,
idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes,
dissensions, factions, envying, drunkenness, and carousing. The areas of life
involved are moral life, worship life, thought life, and social life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Galatian context, the major problem is that of the
Mosaic Law versus grace. This is carried over with the maximum expression of
the “human good” concept. Against this background the Apostle Paul sets forth
the specific sins as the product of the “sinful flesh.” The context for the sin
list in Galatians is that of the old sinful nature and its products.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are: immorality,
impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts
of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions, envying, drunkenness, carousing, and
things like these, of which I forewarn you, just as I have forewarned you, that
those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.” (Galatians
5:19-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ephesians: Failure to mature, developing of scar tissue
on the soul, becoming promiscuous, failure to isolate anger, providing the
opportunity to be tempted, stealing, failure to provide things honestly,
corrupt communication, bitterness, wrath, anger, clamor, evil speaking, malice,
fornication, uncleanness, covetousness, filthiness, foolish talking, jesting,
being deceived by the enemy, being partakers of the evil of others,
fellowshipping with the works of darkness, sleeping when you should be redeeming
the time, being drunk with wine, provoking your children to wrath, serving to
gain the applause of man, showing respect of persons. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The areas of life involved are growth life, moral life,
thought life, spiritual life, relationships to others, legal life, social life,
family life, and communication life. In Ephesians, specific sins find
themselves in the context of being the ingredients or ammunition used by the old
sin nature to frustrate the maturity process of the believer. They stand as the
evidence of not yet gained maturity and the thorns which keep the believer from
maximum benefit in the believer’s living.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Philippians: Preaching Christ in envy and strife, being
terrified by your adversaries, wrong attitude toward suffering, murmurings,
disputes. The areas of life involved are ministry life, thought life, physical
life, and verbal life. In Philippians, sins are found in the context of those
things forbidden for the believer in being a living example of the person of
Christ being formed in you. The sins mentioned are descriptive of those
attitudes which are not compatible with spiritual maturity in Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Colossians: Being spoiled through philosophy and
traditions, asceticism, false humility, neglecting of the body, fornication,
uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil sexual desires, covetousness, anger,
wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication, lying, failure to forgive,
being bitter to your wife, provoking your children, failing to love your
husband. The areas of life involved are thought life, relationships to others,
physical life, moral life, sex life, verbal life, and family life. In
Colossians, the sins fall into the context of being products of cultish
believers who are practicing in the local church. Sophisticated systems are
coupled with the regular expressions of the old sin nature to distort Bible
doctrine and the accurate communication of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 Thessalonians: Unruly, rendering evil for evil, failure
to abstain from all appearances or forms of evil. The areas of life involved
are relationships to others, relationship to evil things, thought and overt
life. In 1 Thessalonians, sins fall into the context of personal response to
the expression of sin, whether that of others or just some evil.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>2 Thessalonians: Failure to withdraw yourself from
disorderly brethren, opposing God, exalting self, deceiving others. The areas
of life involved are relationship to apostates or disorderly brethren, thought
life, and verbal life. In 2 Thessalonians, sins fall into the context of
improperly conducting one’s self, especially with regard to disorderly
brethren, self-exaltation, and deception.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 Timothy: Giving heed to legalistic systems, swerve from
doctrine, turn aside from Word of God, become void of power, woman usurping the
authority of a man, imposing legalistic taboos on others, neglecting your
spiritual gift in development and application, limiting or squeezing the
financial remuneration of the one ministering, love for money, pride, doting on
unworthy question, disputing with men of corrupt minds. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The areas of life involved are apostacy and thought life,
marital life, ministry life, financial life, relationships to apostates. In
Timothy, the basic context for the sins mentioned is that of the work of the
church and its ministry. Much is said as to the people in the ministry, the
conducting of the ministry, the subjects of the ministry, the error and misuses
of the ministry, the trends in the ministry. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>2 Timothy: Self-lover, covetous, boaster, proud,
blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural
affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of
those who are good, traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures, having a
ritual of godliness, always learning but not discerning, failure to study and
prepare adequately, failure to avoid unlearned questions. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The areas of life involved are thought life, family life,
relationships to others’ possessions and pleasures life, and study life. In 2
Timothy, sins are within a context of time or related to specific periods. They
are seen as the characteristics of the last days, for example. They are seen in
particular as describing the personal characteristics of individuals living in
certain periods of time, namely, the last days of the Church and that also of
the Tribulation prior to the coming of the Lord.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Titus: Not blameless, self-willed, angry, wino, acquiring
monetary gain by false pretext, inhospitable, unjust, unholy, intemperate, vain
talkers, women failing to love husband and children, women disobedient to their
husbands, indiscreet, unchaste, accusers, purloining, serving to please
mankind, failing to respond to admonition to return to sound doctrine,
continuing to badger a heretic. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The areas of life involved are thought life, financial
life, social life, family life, ministry life, work-a-day world, and
relationship to heretics. In Titus, the sins listed here find themselves within
the context of “personal characteristics not compatible with functioning in a
local church,” thus having the leadership in mind and the proper function of
the relationship of all people in the church.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Hebrews: Failure to endure chastening, fainting in the
mind, failing to isolate sin, failure to be hospitable, disobedience to them
that have the rule over you, failure to share in financial responsibility as a
believer, being dull of hearing, being slothful, failure to mix promises and
doctrines with faith. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The areas of life involved are growth life, thought life,
social life, life under principle of authority, faith-rest life, study life,
and giving life. In Hebrews, sins are related to the context of maturity. Many
things are shown as hindering spiritual growth, maturity, etc. The basic
characteristics of the sin list for Hebrews has a continuity of “restraining
the believer from his full potential in the Christian life” as illustrated by
the wilderness generation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>James: Being a double-minded man, being a hearer of the
Word only, having respect of persons, failing to bridle the tongue, wars,
fighting, lusts, improper motivations, knowing to do good and going negative,
grudging, impatience, failing to confess. The areas of life involved are
thought life, growth, communication, motivations, relationships with others,
and physical illness.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the James context, the sins relate to matters of
practical living. They fall into the context of the every-day-living world and
the matters of wisdom, learning, enduring, talking, dealing with people, etc.
They are related to the believers, but unbelievers are used for illustration.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 Peter: Failing to submit to the ordinance of man,
misusing liberty as a cover-up for your maliciousness, insubordination of wives
to husbands, improper marital relationship, getting even, passive attitude
toward evil, suffering for evil doing, being proud, serving out of duty rather
than by positive volition, serving for what one gets out of it personally. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The areas of life involved are civil life, thought life,
family life, marital life, relationships to evil surrounding you, physical
life, and ministry life. In 1 Peter, sins fall into the category or context of
improper relationship to people. Sins here are labelled as failing in something,
misusing something or self-induced difficulties.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 Peter 2:1: Malice, deceit, hypocrisy, envy and slander.
The areas of life involved are thought life, growth life, and vocabulary life.
In 1 Peter 2, the sins listed here fall into the context of the babe believer
in specifics but are true of all. They fall in the context of growth and appear
as things that must be removed for the spiritual growth process to have the
most effectiveness.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, putting aside all malice and all deceit and
hypocrisy and envy and all slander,” (1 Peter 2:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 John 2: Loving the world, hating a brother, failure to
test the devil’s message against the Word before buying it, fear. The areas of
life involved are thought life, relationships to the world, relationships to
people, and relationship to false doctrine. In 1 John, the sins listed here
fall within the context of fellowship with God. Sins here are seen as the
evidence of being out of fellowship, the proof of broken fellowship. They
relate certain areas of human living with the fellowship of the believer.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>2 John: Giving your approval and blessings to those who
are not true to the Word of God. The areas of life involved are relationships
in life to apostates. In 2 John, sins are related to the actions of believers
toward unbelievers or people in false doctrine or in apostacy.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>3 John: Loving the preeminence among the brethren,
badmouthing a church. The areas of life involved are motivations, ambitions,
relationship to others, and church life. In 3 John, the sins here are related
in a context of a local church as victim of malicious motivations of people
within it. Therefore, the context for sins listed in 3 John is that of the harm
to a local church and its potential when that sin or sins are allowed to go
unchecked in that local church.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Revelation: Abandoning the first love, being neutralized
by improper relationships and objectives, women leading churches leading into
spiritual fornication, living out a reputation although empty and dead, being
lukewarm. The areas of life involved are the spiritual life, motivations,
church life, and relationships to others. In Revelation 2 and 3, the sins
listed fall within the context of the “missing qualities of the local church,”
or “what is wrong with the local church.” Specifically, they fall within a
context of “securing the immediate judgment of Jesus Christ Himself.”</p>
