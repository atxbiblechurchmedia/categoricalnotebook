<h2>False Criteria for Spirituality </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A state of spirituality of the believer’s soul is
guaranteed by the Word of God immediately following confessing or naming your
known sins to God the Father. This is the only way. Any other way is false. Any
other criterion used to “determine” spirituality is false. Also, there are no
“degrees” of spirituality. It is an absolute. Either God the Holy Spirit is
controlling your soul 100% or your old sin nature is controlling your soul 100%
resulting from committing a sin. It’s all or nothing. 1 John 1:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&quot;  (1 John
1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are commanded in Scripture to be filled with the
Spirit. This is spirituality. We are commanded in Scripture to grow spiritually.
The Word of God is dogmatic on the “how” of spirituality and on the false
striving for spirituality. In being dogmatic, the Word is always right and is
absolute in its authority. Eph. 5:18; 2 Peter 3:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but
be filled with the Spirit,” (Ephesians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory, both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.”
(2 Peter 3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When a minister quotes the Word and is dogmatic, often
that dogmatism is taken for pride. He thinks he knows it all. He is relying on
his education, the letter of the matter, rather than on his heart or devotion
to Christ. It is well to say that dogmatism not based on the Word is
stubbornness and bullheadedness.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the area of spirituality, there is more prejudice,
more fixed notions, and a lot of preconceived ideas. We’ll bump into a lot of
them in this category and into pet sins and ideas. But, let’s stick to God’s
Word and call a spade a spade and let the chips fall where they may. Are we
afraid of the truth?</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Spirituality by Tabooism </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spirituality by tabooism is a false idea that if a
believer does not smoke, drink alcohol, play cards, go to movies, or dance,
they are in a state of spirituality. Many believers today suppose themselves to
be in a state of spirituality because they don’t do those filthy five. One is
not spiritual by outward externals, but by being filled with God the Holy
Spirit (in fellowship). Some taboos are not labeled as sin in the Bible, but in
principle the believer in fellowship may not indulge in them. Not doing something
that is viewed by others as a taboo is not a means to spirituality. It is not
what you do or don’t do. It’s what the Holy Spirit does that matters.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Those that are into spirituality by tabooism are very
moral, self-righteous and very critical of others. They judge believers on this
basis. If they smoke, they are not spiritual and if they don’t smoke, then they
are pretty good people. These are not a means of spirituality. The only true
means of spirituality is application of 1 John 1:9 and the resultant control of
the Holy Spirit. </p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spirituality is not morality or tabooism or adhering to a
list or a code of ethics. It is a supernatural life of control of the
believer’s soul by God the Holy Spirit. Anything an unbeliever can give up is
never a means of spirituality. However, because we walk in the Spirit we do not
do certain things.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When one keeps a set of ground rules to have spirituality
it is called legalism. A person who is using the taboos as a means of
spirituality is always a spiritual moron, a baby, is critical, worries, gripes,
complains, maligns and has a very messed up mental attitude. The cruelest
Christians in the world are very often those adhering to taboos. They are very
critical of anyone who does not keep their “standard” regardless of their
spiritual growth. They may keep certain taboos, but they are usually victims to
the “fearful five,” doubt, discouragement, moodiness, worry and fear. They are
always unproductive, loud-mouth believers, with no impact and very little
testimony. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spirituality only comes from the filling of the Spirit
and when He controls the soul. The believer in fellowship can now claim
promises of God and learn Bible doctrine. The believed Bible doctrine in the
soul applied to life’s situations and decisions while in fellowship will renew
your thinking and correct your mental attitude sins as well as the overt
actions which cause disgrace on the name of Christ. This produces divine good
in the Christian walk.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Spirituality by Comparison or Relativity</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spirituality by comparison or relativity means the
believer compares themselves to others and by subjective means determine they
are more spiritual that others. This is judging others and is a mental attitude
sin. 2 Cor. 10:12. See category on <a href="#_Judging_Others">Judging Others</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For we are not bold to class or compare ourselves with some of
those who commend themselves; but when they measure themselves by themselves
and compare themselves with themselves, they are without understanding.” (2
Corinthians 10:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>These people comparing themselves with others falsely
think that; “I am a better or more spiritual person because my sins are more
refined than theirs.” “I have had a little pride, made a few snide remarks,
lost my temper and been impatient at times, but that isn’t so bad, is it?” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is wrong, first to compare people with people and
then second to make spirituality have degrees. You are either in fellowship
(spiritual) or out of fellowship (carnal). Spirituality is an absolute as is
carnality. There are degrees of spiritual growth, but no degrees of
spirituality!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This false attitude allows individuals to excuse or
minimize their own sins. What sins are excused? The sins of nice, lovely,
cultured people in the pew gossiping, cutting each other’s throats mentally and
verbally? Sin is sin regardless of what we think about it. What counts is what
God thinks about it. Downgrading fellow believers and criticizing them are sins
that are often excused.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When you look at another believer to find fault, you soon
find a crack in their armor. So when you see them with their face in the mud,
it makes you feel better because you would never do such a thing! This is a
misunderstanding of the makeup of the old sin nature. The old sin nature has
trends, some ascetic or law-keeping and some lascivious or lawlessness. One
believer out of fellowship may be a law-keeper. Another out of fellowship may
be a lawless one. But both are out of fellowship. Neither pleases God. See the
old sin nature diagram below.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><img border=0 width=500 height=420 id="Picture 1"
src="False%20Criteria%20for%20Spirituality.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Spirituality by Asceticism</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Asceticism is extreme self-denial to demonstrate you are
spiritual, like monks who have lived on lettuce leaves and yogurt and
contemplated infinity. Sometimes they even try to inflict torture upon
themselves like the “holy men” in India. Other examples are; the not eating of
certain foods to be spiritual, the isolation monasticism, not eating meat on
Friday, fasting to be spiritual, not wearing makeup to show everyone how
spiritual you are, giving up food once a week and letting everybody else know
about it, and even doing things to the point of self-torture to be spiritual.
This is again just human works and unacceptable to God. This not spirituality!
This is false spirituality.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ghandi was supposed to have passed for a Christian
because of his asceticism with his fasting for 40 days being an example. He was
no more of a Christian than Buddha was. This is doing something to try to impress
God. There is denial in Christianity, but it has nothing to do with being in a
state of spirituality. Spirituality can only be gained by the filling of the Holy
Spirit. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Spirituality by Crucifying Self</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Crucifying self is you trying to cancel out yourself. This
is popular in many Christian circles. They say, “I am spiritual because I die
to self.” This is impossible. Usually they use vocabulary such as being broken,
kneeling at the foot of the cross, living an open life, pleading the blood and
such. Actually, this is trying to cancel out self by trying harder or being
more self-sacrificial. This is a misunderstanding of the doctrine of
Retroactive Positional Truth in Romans 6. Self can’t die to self. The old sin
nature cannot cancel out the old sin nature. They often talk about how
exceedingly sinful we are. These people talk a lot about the devil being after
them which is the height of conceit. See category on <a
href="#_Positional_Truth">Positional Truth</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When you are in fellowship, the life you want to live
based on the old sin nature cannot peacefully co-exist with the controlling
ministry of the Holy Spirit. So when you are in fellowship, the outcome is a
life not dominated by the old sin nature.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Perhaps a believer is frustrated, discouraged, and defeated
so they decide to “nail the flesh to the cross.” They may do it through trying
harder, going through a system of sorrow or doing penance for sin, vowing to
live as Jesus lived, all to no avail! One is spiritual only because God the
Holy Spirit controls the soul of the believer. If the believer’s soul is not
100% controlled by the Holy Spirit, then they are 100% in a state of carnality
and out of fellowship with God. To return to spirituality, they must cite, name,
or acknowledging their known or remembered sins to God the Father. Rom. 12:1; 1
John 1:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to
present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is
your spiritual service of worship.” (Romans 12:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Spirituality by Emotionalism or Ecstatics</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Emotionalism or ecstatics is never a criterion for spirituality.
One of the facets of the soul is emotions. Emotion is the appreciator of the
soul, but it is never a criterion for spirituality. Ever! Many people judge
whether they are in a state of spirituality by how they feel emotionally. If
they feel good, they must be in a state of spirituality. If they feel rotten,
everything is rotten and they must be in a state of carnality. How you feel
emotionally has absolutely nothing to do with spirituality. Being filled with
the Holy Spirit is the only criterion. The only way to guarantee that you are
filled with God the Holy Spirit is to confess your known sins to God the Father
using 1 John 1:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The criterion for spirituality is never how you feel,
just as the criterion for salvation is never how you feel. You may have emotion
at salvation or when spiritual but emotion is not the means, the test, or the
measure for either spirituality or salvation. No two people are physically
alike. This is also true in the Christian life. No two people have the same
emotional reaction.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The truth is that no two of us have the same emotional
pattern. Some cry at the drop of an hat, some don’t. Some people are more
emotional than others. There is nothing wrong with emotions if they are
controlled by the facts and faith. If the facts of the Word of God are known
and faith placed in those facts, then the caboose of feeling or emotions will
fall into line. Some people think that the more you weep for souls, the more
souls will come to know Jesus Christ. Not so. Crying has nothing to do with bringing
souls to Christ. Bringing the Gospel to the unbeliever and them accepting our
Lord’s saving work on the Cross for their sins is the only way. Crying in the
large majority of instances in the Word is attributed to the babe, carnality,
weakness, and an ignorance of Bible doctrine. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some may say; “I’m spiritual because I had an experience.”
They always start out by saying, “I was real leery of this before, even against
it, but you know, since I had this experience...” This is an experience
conscious age. Some may think the people who have this experience are such nice
people, such dedicated Christians. It’s the “go get ‘em God” crowd. Rah, rah,
rah! They work each other up into a lather. There is emotion in Christianity.
Emotion is the appreciator of the soul, but it has to be flanked by body
guards. 2 Cor. 6:12-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“You are not restrained by us, but you are restrained in your
own affections. Now in a like exchange—I speak as to children—open wide to us
also.” (2 Corinthians 6:12-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A believer should not try to pour another believer into a
mold. Some groups feel that tongues is the criterion for spirituality. Never!
Tongues is emotionalism or emotional revolt at best and demon possession at the
worst (in unbelievers).</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Spirituality by Prayer</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spirituality by prayer is a subtle, but false means of
spirituality. You can’t pray for the filling of the Spirit. The Bible teaches
that it is provided only by confessing sin biblically. Neither can you pray for
forgiveness and get it. It has been provided only by confessing sin biblically
using 1 John 1:9. Many believers pray, “Lord, fill me” or “God control me.” God
has provided only one way to gain the filling of the Spirit. It is by naming
your known sins to God the Father - confession of sin biblically – only then
are you forgiven of all unknown sins and automatically filled with the Holy
Spirit. As you learn more Bible doctrine from the Word of God, you will learn
more and more of what God says is sin.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Prayer is wonderful and is ordained of God for the
believer. One does not become spiritual by praying, “O Lord help me to be
spiritual, Lord do it.” Some people think they are spiritual by their volume of
praying. They always let you know how much time they are spending praying and
how it is such a worthy operation. They pray for the filling of the Holy
Spirit. They pray to get the Holy Spirit after salvation or more of Him, or
something. They pray in the flesh to look good to God. Prayer is not a means, but
a result of spirituality! We do not pray for the filling of the Holy Spirit.
The filling of the Spirit only comes through biblical confession of sin. Once
the sin or sins are confessed the automatic result is spirituality.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Spirituality by Yieldedness</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spirituality by yieldedness is the most common error
today in the field of spirituality. How is one controlled by the Holy Spirit?
By yielding, someone says and everyone lets it pass. Yieldedness does not
produce spirituality! Too often we get kids up in a mountain in a tall stand of
trees, high altitude, have a fire in the middle, sing some moving choruses,
have some testimonies and then call for the kids to yield their lives to
Christ. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What do they mean by that? Do the unsaved get saved?
Usually they are instructed to pick up a bundle of twigs, sticks, or branches
bound together (a fagot) and throw it into the fire. Then, they are to yield.
Yieldedness is a result of the controlling of the Holy Spirit, not the means!
Some Christians erroneously yield annually or semiannually by dedication,
rededication, vows, formally repeating their vows, or other ways to do more for
God. They say Romans 6:13 and Romans 12:1-2 form the basis for this approach. </p>

<p class=Verses>“and do not go on presenting the members of your body to sin as
instruments of unrighteousness; but present yourselves to God as those alive
from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.”
(Romans 6:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to
present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is
your spiritual service of worship. And do not be conformed to this world, but
be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the
will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect.” (Romans 12:1-2,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What they do not understand is that anything you can do
other than confession of sin whereby the believer is again filled with the Holy
Spirit in not spirituality. These verses describe what the Spirit-filled
believer can accomplish by relying solely on God's grace resources, not their
own abilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Yieldedness is explained as something the believer must
do. This is human works, human good. There is nothing you can do to be yielded.
It is a non-meritorious operation. True yielding is actually claiming the
promise of 1 John 1:9 when you confess sin biblically whereby you are restored
to fellowship with God (filled with the Holy Spirit) - you are therefore yielded.
When you are out of fellowship, you are unyielded! Only a faith operation puts
you back in fellowship! Anything more than confession of known sins to God the
Father is human works and it only muddies the waters.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Spirituality by Keeping the Mosaic Law - the Legalist </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You can always tell who these people are. You can’t blink
your eyes on Sunday, throw a ball or buy gas on Sunday, or go bowling after
Church on Sunday night without their condemnation of your “unspiritual”
activities. If they see someone bounce a tennis ball against the house, they
will run over to tell you that you have violated the Sabbath. If the pastor
washed his car on Sunday, some old biddy will get all shook up.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Spirituality by Rationalism</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Rationalism means to reason things out. Many a believer
has studied Jessie Penn-Lewis, or Watchman Nee and became an expert on
victorious Christian living overnight! Then they are always trying to
straighten someone out because everybody else now is a little bit stupid. You
know the type.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Spirituality by Self-Discipline</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spirituality by self-discipline means that if do certain
things, you will be spiritual. This is by trying harder, trying to love the
brethren, congratulating myself for doing distasteful tasks, getting under a strict
schedule, praying an hour a day and studying the Word another hour. Self-discipline
does not produce spirituality. Self-discipline is certainly part of the
believer’s walk with the Lord, but it is not the means of spirituality!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When they read their Bible, they may read that they are
to love all believers. They then think that since the Bible is always right, they
should go and love all their neighbors. So, they go downtown and see Charlie
Brown coming down the street. Instead of ignoring him like they usually do, they
gush all over him and feel spiritual because they did. Or, they call up Suzy Q,
who is a real deadhead and someone they have no use for and have her over for
tea to gush all over her. They make themselves do it and think it is
spirituality. Or, you tell your wife that you did pretty well today, you met so
and so and talked nicely with him without blowing your stack. This is not
spirituality. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Bible says “Be humble,” so you start to put on a nice
knit dress and then remember you are supposed to be humble so you switch to an
old ragged one. You shine your shoes then scuff them up to look more humble.
Then you walk around stooped over instead of straight and creep around with a
supposedly prayerful attitude. Therefore, when you do look up, your eyes are at
half-mast. When someone yells, “Hey, what’s wrong with you?” You just keep
walking because as a humble person you should be a doormat. It is just part of
the persecution we are asked to bear. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some people think this is spirituality. Some think it is
more spiritual to drive some old wreck of a car than a new one. Some quit
shaving and don’t comb their hair. They constantly say how sinful they are to
get across to the next guy that really they are spiritual. This isn’t humility,
this is hypocrisy and legalism. They cloak their pride in false humility. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Humility is a result of spirituality not the means! When humility
is a result of being filled with the Holy Spirit, it is genuine, not phony. How
do you gain spirituality? Not by doing anything. It is by believing certain
things, but not doing anything. What did you do to get salvation? Nothing, you
believed in the work of Christ on the Cross for your sins. What do you do to be
spiritual? Nothing. You use 1 John 1:9 and return to fellowship with God.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Spirituality by Facial Expression or Body Language</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is superficial hypocrisy. A long, sad, face is not a
manifestation of spirituality. Neither is a smiling face. Spirituality cannot
be judged on the basis of facial expression. Spirituality is on the inside and
if in fellowship there may be an outward animation. However, the outward
animation is not the important factor.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Spirituality by Superficial Evaluation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is assuming a state of spirituality based on results
that you can see. For example, if a pastor of a large church with an
evangelical name, it is assumed that he is in a state of spirituality. Being a
pastor does not means that he is a spiritually mature believer. He should be,
but his position does not necessarily equate to spiritual maturity. He may just
be a good administrator in “gimmick” theology. Also, assuming that a man is in
a state of spirituality just because he can heal someone is false. Satan can
heal. Satan can also heal through demon-possessed unbelievers.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Spirituality by the Second Blessing</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is the so-called area of spiritual maturity by
panacea. Never! One day you’re carnal and a Christian failure, the next day you
wake up and have a great experience and from then on you aare a power for God. Never!
The filling of the Spirit is needed whenever a believer gets out of fellowship.
God's grace is not limited to two times. Believers can have numerous blessings,
but not of the Pentecostal variety.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Spirituality by Psychological Variations</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Many people judge whether they are in a state of
spirituality by how they feel physically. They may be depressed because of a
migraine headache or because of a change in hormone balance. How you feel
physically has absolutely nothing to do with spirituality.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Spirituality by Faulty Deduction</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Often a believer will have a genuine experience but
mislabel it, misunderstand it, and fail to evaluate it. For example, one could
incorrectly call the controlling ministry of the Holy Spirit, the Baptism of
the Holy Spirit. The Baptism of the Spirit is the Holy Spirit placing the new
believer permanently into union with Jesus Christ. The filling of the Spirit
results when the Holy Spirit controls the soul. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Spirituality by Traditionalism</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is trying to achieve spirituality by doing things
the way that have always been done. You have spirituality when you sing songs
first and preach last. You have spirituality when you go through a seven-series
amen, or recite the Apostles Creed. You have spirituality when you recite the
Lord’s Prayer, which isn’t the Lord’s prayer at all.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All of the above false criteria for achieving a state of
spirituality are spirituality by works. They is based on the false premise that
you can do something to attain spirituality. You can do nothing, if you could,
this would mean Christ is honoring the flesh. Spirituality is a non-meritorious
operation based on the Word of God and faith in the promises, techniques,
doctrines and principles revealed by God for the benefit of the human race. </p>
