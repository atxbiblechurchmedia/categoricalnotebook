<h2><a name="_D-Spiritual_Gifts_1"></a>Spiritual Gifts</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual gifts are supernatural enablement given to
believers in Jesus Christ to grow and equip the Body of Christ “for the work of
service” in the Church Age. Spiritual gifts are grace gifts from God. They are
part of God’s grace resources provided to enable the believer to grow spiritually
and in doing so, to evangelize the unbelieving world resulting in the expansion
of the Body of Christ, to function as a member the Body of Christ, to produce
divine good thus glorifying God and fulfilling the plan of God for their lives.
Eph. 4:12-13; Eph. 4:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;for the equipping of the saints for the work of service,
to the building up of the body of Christ; until we all attain to the unity of
the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the
measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ.&quot; 
(Ephesians 4:12-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together
by what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each
individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in
love.&quot;  (Ephesians 4:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual gifts are not an ability nor a talent nor a
general area of accomplishment, either real or potential. They are divine
enablement. 1 Cor. 12:7-8.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit
for the common good. For to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit,
and to another the word of knowledge according to the same Spirit;&quot;  (1
Corinthians 12:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual gifts are not earned, never deserved, not
developed, and not acquired through emotional experience. Your spiritual gift
becomes operational through normal spiritual growth. All Church Age believers were
given a spiritual gift by God the Holy Spirit at salvation. All believers have
equal privilege and opportunity from God's grace resources they gain from Bible
doctrine in the right lobe of their soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Holy Spirit in His sovereign wisdom has provided
different spiritual gifts. Each believer has a different function in the Body
of Christ just as different functions exist for different parts of the human
body. The function of spiritual gifts depends on the filling of the Holy Spirit
and the believer’s level of spiritual growth. If you are growing spiritually,
your gift will automatically begin to function even if you are not aware of
which gift you have.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual gifts function totally apart from emotion.
Emotion neither characterizes the filling of the Spirit nor the function of
spiritual gifts. We have to advance in our spiritual life before we recognize
our spiritual gift. Those who do not advance in their spiritual life never come
to know their spiritual gift.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Categories of Spiritual Gifts</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are two general categories of spiritual gifts - temporary
and permanent. The Church Age is composed of two parts - the Pre-canon period
from 30 to 96 AD and the Post-canon period, which is the remainder of the
Church Age. The permanent spiritual gifts function during both the Pre-canon
period and the Post-canon period. The temporary gifts operated ONLY in the
Pre-canon period of the Church Age from 30 to 96 AD. After 96 AD, all temporary
spiritual gifts ceased to function as a grace operation because their purpose
had been fulfilled according to the Word of God. This is a very important biblical
principle to remember.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If you have personally believed in Jesus Christ as your
personal Savior, you have a permanent spiritual gift. There are no exceptions.
Every believer is given a permanent spiritual gift at salvation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All spiritual gifts are not listed in the Scripture, but
merely representative of categorical concepts. Some gifts require education,
training and preparation and are mentioned, such as evangelism, and pastor-teacher.
For divine production from our spiritual gifts, we must have the filling of the
Holy Spirit and for maximum production from our spiritual gift, we must have a
maximum knowledge and application of Bible truth. The proper attitude to have
toward our spiritual gifts is given in Romans 12:1-8.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to
present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is
your spiritual service of worship. And do not be conformed to this world, but
be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the
will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect. For through the
grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think more highly of
himself than he ought to think; but to think so as to have sound judgment, as
God has allotted to each a measure of faith. For just as we have many members
in one body and all the members do not have the same function, so we, who are
many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another. Since we
have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, each of us is to
exercise them accordingly: if prophecy, according to the proportion of his
faith; if service, in his serving; or he who teaches, in his teaching; or he
who exhorts, in his exhortation; he who gives, with liberality; he who leads,
with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.&quot;  (Romans 12:1-8,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You are not to feel inferior or feel superior about your
spiritual gift. How could we feel inferior if it's a gift and God the Father
planned it and God the Holy Spirit disseminated it at the moment of salvation?
If we feel inferior because of our spiritual gift, then we are saying that God
didn't know what He was doing. God knows exactly which gifts to give, how we
can best serve Him, and how we can contribute to the unity of the Body of
Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Distribution of Spiritual Gifts </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All spiritual gifts are a matter of grace. No gift is
given based on merit of the believer. Spiritual gifts are sovereignly given by
the Holy Spirit to each believer at the point of salvation. Therefore, a
spiritual gift is never earned or deserved. 1 Peter 4:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;As each one has received a special gift, employ it in
serving one another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.&quot;  (1
Peter 4:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The gift given to every Church Age believer represents
the wisdom of the Holy Spirit. For the first 20 year of the Church Age, spiritual
gifts came from the Lord Jesus Christ and God the Holy Spirit. Our Lord made
the first distribution on the day of Pentecost, ten days after His ascension. But
since that time, the Holy Spirit makes the distribution of all spiritual gifts.
Eph. 4:7-8; Heb. 2:4; 1 Cor. 12:11.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But to each one of us grace was given according to the
measure of Christ's gift. Therefore it says, &quot;WHEN HE ASCENDED ON HIGH, HE
LED CAPTIVE A HOST OF CAPTIVES, AND HE GAVE GIFTS TO MEN.&quot;&quot; 
(Ephesians 4:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;God also testifying with them, both by signs and wonders
and by various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit according to His own
will.&quot;  (Hebrews 2:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But one and the same Spirit works all these things,
distributing to each one individually just as He wills.&quot;  (1 Corinthians
12:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Source of Spiritual Gifts </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All members of the Godhead are the source of spiritual
gifts. Since God the Father is the planner, He decided in eternity past how
many of each spiritual gift would be needed to fulfill His plan. In 1
Corinthians 12:28, “And God” refers to God the Father. God the Father uses the
ministry of God the Holy Spirit for giving spiritual gifts. Heb. 2:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And God has appointed in the church, first apostles,
second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps,
administrations, various kinds of tongues.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 12:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;God also testifying with them, both by signs and wonders
and by various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit according to His own
will.&quot;  (Hebrews 2:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ, following His ascension was involved in the
initial distribution of both permanent and temporary spiritual gifts. The temporary
spiritual gifts have not been operational since 96 AD. He then emptied Paradise
by transferring the souls and human spirits of all Old Testament saints to the
third heaven. This was a fulfillment of Isaiah 68:18. Eph. 4:7-8.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;You have ascended on high, You have led captive Your
captives; You have received gifts among men, Even among the rebellious also,
that the LORD God may dwell there.&quot;  (Psalms 68:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But to each one of us grace was given according to the
measure of Christ's gift. Therefore it says, &quot;WHEN HE ASCENDED ON HIGH, HE
LED CAPTIVE A HOST OF CAPTIVES, AND HE GAVE GIFTS TO MEN.&quot;&quot; 
(Ephesians 4:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They have no resurrection bodies yet as this will occur
at our Lord’s Second Advent where Old Testament and Tribulation believers will
receive resurrection bodies. This will complete the Age of Israel. Rev. 11:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;And the nations were enraged, and Your wrath came,
and the time came for the dead to be judged, and the time to reward Your
bond-servants the prophets and the saints and those who fear Your name, the
small and the great, and to destroy those who destroy the earth.&quot;&quot; 
(Revelation 11:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Coordination of Spiritual Gifts</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Holy Spirit gives and coordinates the spiritual gifts
in the universal Body of Christ and the pastor-teacher coordinates the local
church. Eph. 4:11-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and
some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the
saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of
Christ;&quot;  (Ephesians 4:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Bible doctrine is what makes the spiritual gifts
function. The local church has three structures; the pastor-teacher, spiritual
gifts of the deacon board members, and spiritual gifts in the congregation.
Thus, the spiritual gifts speak of balance, coordination, production,
practicality, and durability.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'><i>Balance -
all spiritual gifts are necessary. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'><i>Coordination
- all competition in Christ is removed. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'><i>Production -
every believer has their place, their niche. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'><i>Practicality
- every believer exercising their spiritual gift has confidence. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'><i>Durability -
every believer contributes to the outworking of God’s plan.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is not necessary for you to recognize your spiritual
gift for you to function under it. Function is dependent upon the filling of
the Holy Spirit, and the erection of an edification complex, rather than a
knowledge of your spiritual gift. For divine production from your spiritual
gift, you need the filling of the Holy Spirit and the transfer of <i>gnosis</i>
(knowledge) from the left lobe of the mentality of the soul into <i>epignosis</i>
(full knowledge) in the right lobe of the soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual gifts are the Father’s organized witness (not
personal witness) to the plan of salvation. In evangelism, many more gifts are
operating than the gift of evangelism. It is a divine good team effort by the Body
of Christ. Heb. 2:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;God also testifying with them, both by signs and wonders
and by various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit according to His own
will.&quot;  (Hebrews 2:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Perspective of the spiritual gifts is given in 1 Corinthians
12. Possession of a spiritual gift does not indicate merit or spirituality.
“Gift” connotes grace. Paul was the worst sinner who ever lived, yet he was
given several spiritual gifts. 1 Tim. 1:12-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has strengthened me,
because He considered me faithful, putting me into service, even though I was
formerly a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent aggressor. Yet I was shown
mercy because I acted ignorantly in unbelief; and the grace of our Lord was
more than abundant, with the faith and love which are found in Christ
Jesus.&quot;  (1 Timothy 1:12-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Proper Attitude Toward Our Spiritual Gifts</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What is your attitude toward spiritual gifts? Romans 12:1-2
deals with that subject of each believer being a living sacrifice. This is you
as a believer being willing to do the will of God in your life, regardless
where He takes you. This is thinking and doing whatever the will of God entails
and thinking God's thoughts after Him - the mind of Christ enabling you to
fulfill the will of God. This is a description of a mature believer. Being a
mature believer is simply the result of being filled with the Holy Spirit,
walking in the power of the Holy Spirit, and applying the Word of God from your
soul to the issues and decisions in life. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to
present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is
your spiritual service of worship. And do not be conformed to this world, but
be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the
will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect.&quot;  (Romans
12:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual growth enables each of us to apply
unconditional <i>agapao</i> mental attitude love toward other people. This
should be your attitude when using your spiritual gift. You should be willing
to do God's will, whatever it might be, because you have put it to the test
already and found it to be of God’s will which is good and perfect.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When you are growing spiritually, then you will not feel
inferior toward any spiritual gift. You will not feel superior about any
spiritual gift. Why? It is a gift from the grace of God. You should find it
impossible to feel either superior or inferior.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Whatever you are doing for the Lord, you must do it with unconditional
love toward other people. If you do not love other people, your utilization of
your spiritual gift will be hypocritical. You will just be a pretender. You
might even be serving and utilizing your spiritual gifts to the maximum. As
concerning production, those who serve and do a lot because they love the
martyr complex, do so selfishly. That is not serving the Lord with
unconditional mental attitude love. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Team Concept of Spiritual Gifts</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Just as team sports involve players each with a certain
position and function, so does the Body of Christ regarding spiritual gifts. 
Every operational spiritual gift is necessary for the advancement of the Body
of Christ. 1 Cor. 12:1; 1 Cor. 12:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I do not want
you to be unaware.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 12:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same
Spirit.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 12:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The function of all spiritual gifts depends on the
believer being filling of the Holy Spirit and having matured spiritually to
some degree. There are also many types of Christian service and many
opportunities for Christian service. We all serve the same Lord, but we do not
serve in the same way. 1 Cor. 12:5‑7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And there are varieties of ministries, and the same Lord.
There are varieties of effects, but the same God who works all things in all
persons. But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the
common good.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 12:5-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The sovereignty of God the Holy Spirit is the source of
spiritual gifts. He gives the believer their spiritual gift at salvation on the
basis of His decision, not ours. Our spiritual gift is given from the wisdom of
the Holy Spirit, not based on any personal merit. We do not acquire, attain,
earn, or deserve our spiritual gift. 1 Cor. 12:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But one and the same Spirit works all these things,
distributing to each one individually just as He wills.&quot;  (1 Corinthians
12:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 Corinthians 12:26‑27 teaches the importance of teamwork
in spiritual gifts. Believers are involved in the highest form of teamwork in
the Body of Christ that has ever existed.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with
it; if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it. Now you are
Christ's body, and individually members of it.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 12:26-27,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 Corinthians 12:28-30 teaches the perspective of the
diversity of temporary spiritual gifts during the Pre-Canon period of the
Church Age. Some men were given the spiritual gift of teaching mystery
doctrines that would eventually be in writing in the completed New Testament.
This was not the same as the permanent spiritual gift of pastor-teacher. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And God has appointed in the church, first apostles,
second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps,
administrations, various kinds of tongues. All are not apostles, are they? All
are not prophets, are they? All are not teachers, are they? All are not workers
of miracles, are they? All do not have gifts of healings, do they? All do not
speak with tongues, do they? All do not interpret, do they?&quot;  (1
Corinthians 12:28-30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul urges the Corinthians in 1 Corinthians 12:31 to look
for the greater spiritual gifts – the permanent spiritual gifts coupled with
the written completed canon of the New Testament. This combination is the
“still more excellent way.”</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But earnestly desire the greater gifts. And I show you a
still more excellent way.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 12:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The sensational, temporary spiritual gifts of the Pre-Canon
period were not the “greater gifts” mentioned in this context (apostleship,
tongues, prophecy, interpretation of tongues). The sensational spiritual gifts
belong to the Pre-Canon period of the Church Age (30-96 AD).  These gifts
provided the New Testament verbally before the New Testament was written. Many
theologians consider the temporary to be the greater spiritual gifts, but they
are not. The greater spiritual gifts are permanent spiritual gifts of the Post-Canon
period of the Church Age.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Human Body Analogy of Spiritual Gifts</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Certain parts of the human body are prominent with others
hidden. Some spiritual gifts are prominent with others hidden. All Church Age
believers are made members of the Body of Christ through the Baptism of the
Holy Spirit where were are placed in union with Jesus Christ at salvation. 1
Cor. 12:12-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For even as the body is one and yet has many members, and
all the members of the body, though they are many, are one body, so also is
Christ. For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or
Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one
Spirit.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 12:12-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Body of Christ, there are no racial distinctions
and no social distinctions. Once you believe in Jesus Christ, you are a member
of the God’s family with equal privilege and equal opportunity. The body has
unity with many parts functioning in concert with each other. 1 Cor. 12:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For the body is not one member, but many.&quot;  (1
Corinthians 12:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An analogy is made between the physical body in its
coordination and the Body of Christ in its coordination of spiritual gifts. As
these spiritual gifts are exercised, all competition is replaced with
coordination, the true unity in the Body of Christ. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One part of the human body is not more important than any
other part of the human body. Whether it is something obvious and used all the
time such as your hands for example, they are really no more important that the
pituitary gland. If you had a malfunction of this gland, it would affect every
other part of the body adversely as it grows. Every part of the human body is
important for the purpose that God designed it. That's the way it is with the Body
of Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The analogy is continued in 1 Corinthians 12:21-22. For
example, the eye cannot say it doesn’t need the hand. Also, the head can’t say
it doesn’t need the feet. The head is just as important as the foot and the
eyes are just as important as the hands. It goes on to say that those parts of
the body that seem to be weaker are actually indispensable and the parts that
are unpresentable in public are treated with special modesty. Remember the
importance of the little pituitary gland?</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And the eye cannot say to the hand, &quot;I have no need
of you&quot;; or again the head to the feet, &quot;I have no need of you.&quot;
On the contrary, it is much truer that the members of the body which seem to be
weaker are necessary;&quot;  (1 Corinthians 12:21-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the analogy, Christ is the head and shepherd of the
sheep. The pastor-teacher is the under-shepherd in the local church. Eph. 5:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also
is the head of the church, He Himself being the Savior of the body.&quot; 
(Ephesians 5:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When one spiritual gift is not functioning, the rest of
the Body (in the local church) suffers. 1 Cor. 12:26. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with
it; if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.&quot;  (1
Corinthians 12:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 Corinthians 12:29-31 tells us that each believer is
given different spiritual gifts. Paul also tells us that we are to desire the
greater gifts eagerly. In other words, as you grow spiritually you will have
the power of the Holy Spirit to apply believed or <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine
and to utilize that spiritual gift. In the local church, we want to see the
greater gifts. We want to see the gifts that benefit others, leading them to
the Lord, and helping them to grow spiritually. Paul continues to tell them
that he will show them a more excellent way. That more excellent way is the
emphasis on spiritual growth in unconditional <i>agapao</i> love where dealing
with others is based on the very thinking of Christ in our souls.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;All are not apostles, are they? All are not prophets, are
they? All are not teachers, are they? All are not workers of miracles, are
they? All do not have gifts of healings, do they? All do not speak with
tongues, do they? All do not interpret, do they? But earnestly desire the
greater gifts. And I show you a still more excellent way.&quot;  (1 Corinthians
12:29-31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is a great diversity of spiritual gifts. Maybe you
don't have the gift of service or administration or helps. Maybe you have a
talent or ability that God gave you at the moment of salvation. God knows your
personality and your capabilities far better than you know yourself. He knew
exactly what would be the best spiritual gift to give you in eternity past.
Don’t go overboard on spiritual gifts. Emphasize the spiritual life!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As you grow spiritually and identify your gift(s), use it
because you have personal love for God. As a result, you will have
unconditional love toward your fellow believer. You are to have the heart of a
servant. Whatever your gift, let that gift function under unconditional love
which is the divine love that God has for all of us. It is reproduced in your
soul through spiritual growth so that you have a love that's dependent on your
own strength of character, not the attractiveness of other believers. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 Corinthians 13:1-3 says to those who were abusing their
spiritual gifts that regardless of the spiritual gifts, no matter what God
graced you out with, the all-important thing is not that spiritual gift. The
all-important thing is unconditional love. We have to be Spirit-filled to have
our gift function correctly and to have maximum divine good produced under our
spiritual gift. We must have maximum Bible doctrine in the soul to have our
gift function to the maximum intended by God. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but do
not have love, I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have the
gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all
faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. And if I
give all my possessions to feed the poor, and if I surrender my body to be
burned, but do not have love, it profits me nothing.&quot;  (1 Corinthians
13:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Misuses of Spiritual Gifts</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual gifts are misused in two ways. One way is to
attempt to perpetuate temporary spiritual gifts of the Pre‑Canon period into
the Post-Canon period of the Church Age. These involve healing, miracles,
tongues, or the interpretation of tongues. The second way spiritual gifts are misused
is due to either arrogance about the possession of one of the more obvious
gifts or an inferiority complex about the possession of one of the less obvious
spiritual gifts. 1 Corinthians 12:15-21 describes both types of abuse.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If the foot says, &quot;Because I am not a hand, I am not a
part of the body,&quot; it is not for this reason any the less a part of the
body. And if the ear says, &quot;Because I am not an eye, I am not a part of
the body,&quot; it is not for this reason any the less a part of the body. If
the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were
hearing, where would the sense of smell be? But now God has placed the members,
each one of them, in the body, just as He desired. If they were all one member,
where would the body be? But now there are many members, but one body. And the
eye cannot say to the hand, &quot;I have no need of you&quot;; or again the
head to the feet, &quot;I have no need of you.&quot;” (1 Corinthians 12:15-21,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Many believers are arrogant because their spiritual gift
functions in a more obvious way (e.g., pastor-teacher, evangelism, and
administration). Others believers have an inferiority complex because their
spiritual gift functions out of the lime light and are less obvious to others
nearby (e.g., service, helps, exhortation, giving, showing mercy, and faith). Both
arrogance and the inferiority complex are sins and are signs that these
believers are out of fellowship. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Misuse of Spiritual Gifts in the Corinthian Church</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Corinthian Church emphasized and exalted spectacular
gifts and related them to spirituality.  Spectacular gifts are not spirituality
any more than less spectacular gifts. Spirituality is not based upon spiritual
gifts, but based on the filling of the Holy Spirit. It is obvious from 1 Corinthians
1:7 that the Corinthian Church abounded in spiritual gifts. It is also obvious
from the rest of the Epistle that this was one of the most carnal churches that
ever assembled in the name of the Lord. The Corinthians were noted for their
envy, jealousy, childishness, spiritual bullying, litigation, divorce,
drunkenness and other carnality activity.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;so that you are not lacking in any gift, awaiting eagerly
the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ,&quot;  (1 Corinthians 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The possession of a spiritual gift does not mean
spirituality. If the Corinthians, with all their carnality could have more
people with spectacular spiritual gifts, then there is definitely no
correlation between possessing a certain type of spiritual gift and
spirituality. It is important to distinguish between spiritual gifts and
spirituality. For a spiritual gift to function, the believer with the gift must
be filled with the Holy Spirit.  Spirituality is a state where the Holy Spirit
controls the soul of the believer or they are in fellowship with Jesus Christ.
Therefore, the spiritual gift only functions when the believer is in a state of
spirituality. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In developing the subject of spiritual gifts, Paul had
those in the Corinthian assembly who had learned this doctrine and forgotten
it, or had learned this doctrine and misapplied it, or understood this doctrine
in part and used it as a lever for bullying, legalism, and pseudo-spirituality,
or had never understood this doctrine in the first place and were being abused
by it in the second place. Because of his varied audience, Paul had to review
for those who knew, take up the slack for those who did not know, and put it
all together and get the point across. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Corinth was a great center for trade at that time. The
Jews had captured the banking industry from the heathen priests. This drew
large numbers of Jews to Corinth. Consequently, the gift of tongues was used
quite extensively in Corinth. The Gentiles there had picked up tongues and were
abusing it. The Corinthian Christians were probably the most carnal of all
believers in the early Church. Since they were out of line in many ways, it was
no surprise that they were corrupting and misusing the gift of tongues. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>False teaching based on legalism and emotionalism had
also infiltrated the church at Corinth, consequently we have 1 Corinthians 12 -
14 to refute the legalism and emotionalism there. These chapters were written
to deal with some of the false impressions that came out of speaking in
tongues. What was happening in Corinth is still happening in churches today.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One of the abuses in the Corinthian church was that there
were many people speaking in tongues and they felt they were the spiritual
giants in the assembly. They said the rest were peons and possibly not even
saved. They were looking down their spiritual noses at the rest and saying that
until they spoke in tongues they were not spiritual, or possibly not even
saved.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Brother foot has an inferiority complex. Brother hand has
a superiority complex. Both are ignorant of doctrine. They are both on the same
team, but play different positions. One is not better than the other. The
spiritual gift you possess is not the important factor. What is important is
the filling of the Holy Spirit and the power on which the spiritual gift
operates. </p>
