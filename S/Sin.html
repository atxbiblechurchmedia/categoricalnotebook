<h2><a name="_D-Sin"></a>Sin</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sin is defined as acting contrary to the perfect
character of God or acting independently of God and God’s provision. Sin is
falling short of the glory or perfect absolute righteousness (+R) of God. Rom.
3:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,”
(Romans 3:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Source of Sin</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sin originated with Satan through negative volition and
his five “I wills.” Isaiah 14:12-15.</p>

<p class=Verses>““How you have fallen from heaven, O star of the morning, son
of the dawn! You have been cut down to the earth, You who have weakened the
nations! “But you said in your heart, ‘I will ascend to heaven; I will raise my
throne above the stars of God, And I will sit on the mount of assembly In the
recesses of the north. ‘I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will
make myself like the Most High.’ “Nevertheless you will be thrust down to
Sheol, To the recesses of the pit.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah 14:12-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God created Adam in innocence. Adam was a free moral
agent as was Satan and all other angels. Adam had free will. The only way Adam
could sin in innocence was negative volition, acting independently of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some argue that God made all things and since sin is a
thing, God made sin. The answer is that sin is not a thing. Sin is acting
independently of God either mentally or overtly. God did not create sin. Sin is
a result of negative volition.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Thinking that God could be the author of sin ignores the
perfect essence of God. God is not the author of sin, nor is He the author of
temptation. It would be incompatible with His perfect divine essence. All human
sins come from their volition with inward temptation to sin coming from their old
sin nature and outward temptation from many external sources. James 1:13-15.
See category on <a href="#_Essence_of_God_1">Essence of God</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Let no one say when he is tempted, &quot;I am being tempted by
God&quot;; for God cannot be tempted by evil, and He Himself does not tempt
anyone. But each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own
lust. Then when lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and when sin is
accomplished, it brings forth death.” (James 1:13-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In innocence in the Garden, Adam had the capacity to sin,
but not the nature to sin (an old sin nature). God did not create Adam with an
old sin nature. Adam acquired an old sin nature through negative volition. The
sovereignty of God and the free will of man co-existent on this earth. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The sovereignty of God gave man free will. Why? To
resolve the Angelic Conflict. Free will gave mankind the right to choose for themselves
even in opposition to the will of God. Adam’s choice was made against God’s
will. However, God is “not willing that any should perish.” 2 Peter 3:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some count
slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing for any to perish but for all
to come to repentance.” (2 Peter 3:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Categories of Sin</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are three general categories of sin - imputed sin,
inherent sin, and personal sin.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Imputed Sin</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Adam was created by Jesus Christ to be spiritually alive.
Adam sinned willingly after the woman had first been deceived by the serpent
and had eaten of the forbidden fruit. The woman’s sin became the first sin of
the human race and she died spiritually when she sinned. Adam also died
spiritually as the second case of spiritual death of the human race. Because
Adam sinned willingly, his sin is the basis for imputed sin to the rest of the
human race. Rom. 5:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world,
and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned—”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
5:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All members of the human race are born physically alive,
but spiritually dead and are therefore born as unbelievers. All members of the
human race are born condemned due to their imputed sin at birth and their old
sin nature passed genetically to them from their fathers. All they can ever
produce is relative righteousness (-R) which is completely unacceptable to God.
The only exception to this was Jesus Christ. Isaiah 64:6; 1 Cor. 15:22; 1 Cor.
2:16. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For all of us have become like one who is unclean, And all our
righteous deeds are like a filthy garment; And all of us wither like a leaf,
And our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah 64:6,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made
alive.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 15:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT
HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is no longer any condemnation to those who believe
in Jesus Christ. While imputed sin occurred at birth, belief in Jesus Christ as
Savior causes salvation through grace whereby a human spirit is created in
every believer. Through regeneration, the individual is made spiritually alive.
At salvation, God the Father imputed His very own absolute righteousness (+R)
to every believer which is the basis for the spiritual life. Rom. 8:1; Eph.
2:5-6; Col. 2:13-14; 1 Cor. 15:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive
together with Christ (by grace you have been saved), and raised us up with Him,
and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians
2:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“When you were dead in your transgressions and the
uncircumcision of your flesh, He made you alive together with Him, having
forgiven us all our transgressions, having canceled out the certificate of debt
consisting of decrees against us, which was hostile to us; and He has taken it
out of the way, having nailed it to the cross.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Colossians 2:13-14,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made
alive.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 15:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Inherent Sin</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Adam’s sin brought into existence the first old sin
nature, which is the basis for inherent sin. All human beings are born with an
old sin nature. While still a sinner, the old sin nature is condemned by God.
The remedy for continuous old sin nature control of the unbeliever’s soul is
salvation in Jesus Christ. For the believer, remaining in fellowship with God is
obtained by confessing known sins to God the Father and being restored to the
filling of the Holy Spirit via 1 John 1:9. When the Holy Spirit controls the
soul, the old sin nature is not in control. This is an absolute status. Rom.
8:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For what the Law could not do, weak as it was through the
flesh, God did: sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and as an
offering for sin, He condemned sin in the flesh,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 8:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ died on the Cross for the personal sins of
mankind, but He rejected the human good produced from the old sin nature. For
Church Age believers, this human good will be removed at the Judgment Seat of
Christ. 1 John 1:7; Eph. 2:8-9; Rom. 4:4-5; Rom. 6:10; Rom. 8:8; Isaiah 64:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but if we walk in the Light as He Himself is in the Light, we
have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us
from all sin.” (1 John 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not
of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one
may boast.” (Ephesians 2:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now to the one who works, his wage is not credited as a favor,
but as what is due. But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who
justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness,” (Romans 4:4-5,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the death that He died, He died to sin once for all; but
the life that He lives, He lives to God.” (Romans 6:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and those who are in the flesh cannot please God.” (Romans
8:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For all of us have become like one who is unclean, And all our
righteous deeds are like a filthy garment; And all of us wither like a leaf,
And our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.” (Isaiah 64:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Personal Sin</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Personal sin can be either mental attitude sin, verbal
sin, or overt sin. All personal sin comes from your volition or free will. Once
Adam had first sinned, he was tempted thereafter by outside sources and from
within by his newly formed old sin nature. Just as in Adam, all of our personal
sins come from our volition with temptation coming from outside sources and
from within by our genetically inherited old sin nature.  Psalms 51:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, And in sin my mother
conceived me.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 51:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 5:12, “one man” refers to the first man – Adam.
“Sin entered into the world” refers to the first old sin nature. “Death” refers
to the first spiritual death. “Sin” refers to the first sin of the human race -
negative volition. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, just as through one man (Adam) sin entered into the
world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all
sinned—”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 5:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord Jesus Christ was judged for the personal sins of
all mankind on the Cross. His substitutionary spiritual death makes it possible
for the human race to become spiritually alive. Following salvation, the penalty
of personal sin is carnality or no fellowship with God. Spirituality or the
filling of the Holy Spirit is recovered via use of 1 John 1:9 for the believer.
Matt. 27:46; Rom 6:23; 1 John 2:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“About the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice,
saying, &quot;ELI, ELI, LAMA SABACHTHANI?&quot; that is, &quot;MY GOD, MY GOD,
WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME?&quot;” (Matthew 27:46, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is
eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Romans 6:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins; and not for
ours only, but also for those of the whole world.” (1 John 2:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Issue of Sin</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The unbeliever is one who has rejected Jesus Christ as their
Savior. This will be the basis of their condemnation at the Great White Throne
Judgment following the Millennium. Sins will not be the issue. Rejection of the
atoning work of Jesus Christ on the Cross for their sins will be the issue.
Because of their rejection, they will be judged on the merits of their good
deeds which will never be good enough to satisfy the absolute righteousness of
God. John 3:18; John 3:36; Isaiah 64:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>““He who believes in Him is not judged; he who does not believe
has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only
begotten Son of God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who does
not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(John
3:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For all of us have become like one who is unclean, And all our
righteous deeds are like a filthy garment; And all of us wither like a leaf,
And our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.” (Isaiah 64:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Most sins are mentioned in Scripture for the edification
of the believer. To regain the filling of the Holy Spirit, the believer is to
use 1 John 1:9 with regard to known sins. In 1 John 1:9, “sins” refers to
personal sins as an action.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
John 1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 John 1:8, “sin” in the singular refers to the old
sin nature except occasionally when it refers to sin as a principle as in Romans
5:13 or to one specific sin as in Adam’s first sin.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves and
the truth is not in us.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 John 1:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“for until the Law sin was in the world, but sin is not imputed
when there is no law.” (Romans 5:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The word “dead” in Colossians 3:5 means to render
impotent by using confession of sin and then through the filling of the Holy
Spirit. 1 John 1:9; Rom. 8:13. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore consider the members of your earthly body as dead to
immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and greed, which amounts to
idolatry.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Colossians 3:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
John 1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses> “for if you are living according to the flesh, you must die;
but if by the Spirit you are putting to death the deeds of the body, you will
live.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 8:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Colossians 3:5, “members of your earthly body” refers
to the old sin nature. This verse mentions one overt sin and four mental
attitude sins. “Immorality” refers to overt sin, both technical (referring to
the Phallic Cult) and in general. “Impurity” refers to mental adultery or
mental lewdness or impurity of mind. “Passion” here refers to depraved passion.
“Evil desire” refers to the lust patterns of the old sin nature which are
mental sins. “Greed, which amounts to idolatry” is any mental attitude sin that
puts anything before the Lord.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Father administers divine discipline to believers
out of fellowship (carnal). The carnal believer imitates the unbeliever. Col.
3:6-7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For it is because of these things that the wrath of God will
come upon the sons of disobedience, and in them you also once walked, when you
were living in them.” (Colossians 3:6-7, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Colossians 3:8, “put them all aside” refers to
confessing known sins and thereby rendering the old sin nature impotent. Apply Retroactive
Positional Truth. “Anger” is <span lang=EL>ο</span>̓<span lang=EL>ργη</span>́
(orgē) in the Greek and refers to emotion caused by jealousy. This is also a mental
attitude sin and may be a sudden burst of activity or an inward burn which
results in violence. “Wrath” refers to a turbulence of emotions expressed
outwardly - mental attitude sins like tantrums.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But now you also, put them all aside: anger, wrath, malice,
slander, and abusive speech from your mouth.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Colossians 3:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Malice” is a mental attitude sin of lust to hurt
someone. This may come from jealousy or frustration. It generally expresses
itself through the sins of the tongue. “Slander” refers to maligning either God’s
character or His work. This is a sin of the tongue and runs the gamut from
legalism to the expression of false doctrine. “Abusive speech” is also a sin of
the tongue and refers to obscene language which indicates a foul mind.</p>

<p class=Verses>“for if you are living according to the flesh, you must die;
but if by the Spirit you are putting to death the deeds of the body, you will
live.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 8:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 8:13, there is an inner conflict between the old
sin nature and the filling of the Holy Spirit. To “die” refers to temporal
death. To “live” refers to temporal life or the filling of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do not lie to one another, since you laid aside the old self
with its evil practices, and have put on the new self who is being renewed to a
true knowledge according to the image of the One who created him—”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Colossians
3:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Galatians 5:19 lists some of the sexual sins. “Immorality”
refers to the overt act of adultery. “Impurity” refers to the act of sex
outside of marriage and sex in the name of religion. “Sensuality” refers to mental
adultery or lasciviousness - sexual lust.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are: immorality,
impurity, sensuality,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Galatians 5:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The old sin nature can control the believer
directionally. In Galatians 5:20, “idolatry” is <span lang=EL>φαρμακει</span>́<span
lang=EL>α</span> (pharmakeia) in the Greek and is directed toward God.
“Sorcery” is directed toward self and is the practice of witchcraft and
includes any type of addiction to drugs, etc. “Enmities” is directed toward others.
“Strife” is mental hatred toward others.</p>

<p class=Verses>“idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of
anger, disputes, dissensions, factions,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Galatians 5:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Jealousy” is also directed toward others and is seeking
to outdo others by playing spiritual king of the mountain. “Outbursts of anger”
are outward emotional sins like tantrums. “Disputes” is taking sides without
knowledge. “Dissensions” is revolt against the Word of God.  “Factions” is opinion
contrary to the Word of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some of the personal sins are listed in Galatians 5:19-21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are: immorality,
impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts
of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions, envying, drunkenness, carousing, and
things like these, of which I forewarn you, just as I have forewarned you, that
those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Galatians
5:19-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are inner personal sins or mental attitude sins
such as envy, jealousy, etc. There are also outward personal sins or overt sins
such as murder, drunkenness, reveling, orgies, etc. The alternative to personal
sins is the spiritual life where the fruit of the Spirit or divine good can be
produced. Gal. 5:22-23. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience,
kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things
there is no law.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Galatians 5:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><a name="_Sins_of_the"></a><b>Seven Paths to Sin</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are indeed many ways to get out of fellowship and
all of them involve personal sin. The Scripture contains many “sin lists” among
them Romans 1:18-32, Galatians 5:19-21, Proverbs 6:16-19, and Colossians
3:5-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“There are six things which the LORD hates, Yes, seven which
are an abomination to Him: Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, And hands that shed
innocent blood, A heart that devises wicked plans, Feet that run rapidly to
evil, A false witness who utters lies, And one who spreads strife among
brothers.” (Proverbs 6:16-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore consider the members of your earthly body as dead to
immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and greed, which amounts to
idolatry. For it is because of these things that the wrath of God will come
upon the sons of disobedience, and in them you also once walked, when you were
living in them. But now you also, put them all aside: anger, wrath, malice,
slander, and abusive speech from your mouth. Do not lie to one another, since
you laid aside the old self with its evil practices, and have put on the new
self who is being renewed to a true knowledge according to the image of the One
who created him—” (Colossians 3:5-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Colossians lists fornication, uncleanness, inordinate
affection, evil conscience, covetousness, anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, and
filthy communication out of your mouth. But all sin lists amount to the
following seven principles.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>A spirit of pride.</u> This is an exalted feeling
based on success or position, because of good training, nice appearance, or
natural gift or abilities. It is an inner feeling of self-importance,
arrogance, as distinguished from self-assurance, confidence, and capability. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Love or desire for human approbation or praise.</u>
This is a secret fondness to be noticed and recognized by the Christian
community. This is love of supremacy, drawing attention to one’s accomplishments
and abilities while running others down in order to build up self.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Social interaction anger or impatience.</u> This is a
touchy and sensitive nature with resentment and retaliation when disapproved
and contradicted. It also includes jealousy, sour grapes, envy, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Self-will.</u> This is having a stubborn or
unteachable nature. This is having a disposition to be argumentative, harsh, and
bitter. This is being a nitpicker, one who is always critical, one who minds
the business of others more than their own, one who has a long proboscis. Such
people are always checking everybody out and making themselves the criteria of
authority instead of the Word of God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The tendency to magnify the faults and failings of
others while emphasizing your own virtues. </u>This is having an unpleasant
feeling when others succeed or prosper. When someone prospers you say, “Oh yes,
sure, anyone can prosper who has the family money behind them.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Negative disposition.</u> This is a peevish and
fretful disposition that loves to be coaxed and honored. These people have a dishonest
and deceitful disposition that tends toward discouragement and despondency
under pressure or an attempt to solves one’s problems by hysteria and tantrums.
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Apathy.</u> This is indifference to doctrine and the
Scriptures in general. It is carnal emotional revolt piled high. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The above are all manifestations of the emotional revolt
of the soul. See category on <a href="#_Emotional_Revolt_of">Emotional Revolt
of the Soul</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Most Serious Sins</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 6:16-19, there are seven sins that God
considers the most serious. The phrase “an abomination” means they are the
worst. There are four sins of the tongue, two mental attitude sins and one
overt sin.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;There are six things which the LORD hates, Yes, seven
which are an abomination to Him: Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, And hands that
shed innocent blood, A heart that devises wicked plans, Feet that run rapidly
to evil, A false witness who utters lies, And one who spreads strife among
brothers.&quot;  (Proverbs 6:16-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first is “haughty eyes” and is the mental attitude
sin of pride. Pride plus lust results in jealousy. This is thinking pride with
wicked imagination. The second is “a lying tongue” which is the habitual liar.
This is a sin of the tongue. The third is “hands that shed innocent blood” or
murder. This overt sin is not referring to killing during war. In Exodus 20:13,
the commandment “Thou shalt not kill” in the King James is really the Hebrew
word for “murder,” not “kill.”</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;You shall not murder.&quot;  (Exodus 20:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fourth is “a heart that devises wicked plans” and is
the right lobe of the soul controlled by emotional revolt and filled with
mental attitude sins. This is a right lobe filled with jealousy, which breeds
suspicion. Suspicion think’s the worst. The worst in the mind is the
imagination.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fifth is “feet that run rapidly to evil” which is a
sin of the tongue. This is a person going around making trouble. Most trouble
is caused by the use of the tongue and involves gossip, resulting in overt sin
- making trouble for others.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The sixth is “a false witness who utters lies.” This is
the sin of the tongue of perjury and downgrading someone. This is playing
spiritual king of the mountain.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The seventh is “one who spreads strife among brothers”
and is the sin of the tongue of maligning others.</p>
