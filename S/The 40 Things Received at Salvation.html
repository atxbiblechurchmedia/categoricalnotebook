<h2><a name="_Salvation,_40_Things"></a><a name="_The_40_Things"></a><a
name="_D-The_40_Things"></a>The 40 Things Received at Salvation</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the moment of faith alone in Jesus Christ alone for
salvation, every believer living in the Church Age receives 40 absolute things
from the grace of God. Each believer receives these 40 things before they do
anything. Because they are grace gifts, you cannot earn them nor do you deserve
them. This is God's grace in action and it’s all instantaneous.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Of the 40 absolutes, 39 of them are permanent,
irrevocable, and can never be removed from the believer even by God Himself!
The only temporary or revocable absolute is the filling of the Holy Spirit
which we lose due to our own free will to sin against God. We can repeatedly
regain the filling of the Holy Spirit following confession of our known sins to
God the Father. 1 John 1:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The purpose of these 40 grace gifts at salvation is to
enable spiritual growth, orientation to God’s grace and His plan for each
believer, and by doing so, glorify God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>1. Reside in God’s Eternal Plan and Share Christ’s
Destiny</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every believer enters God’s eternal plan at the moment of
salvation and shares the eternal destiny of our Lord Jesus Christ. The believer
also receive all of God's unseen grace resources necessary to live and grow
spiritually in the Christian life. As the believer grows spiritually, they
begin to recognize and make use of these grace resources which glorify God. From
spiritual growth comes blessings from God while living on earth and in
eternity. Eph. 1:2-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus
Christ. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed
us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ, just as He
chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and
blameless before Him. In love He predestined us to adoption as sons through
Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will, to the
praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely bestowed on us in the
Beloved.” (Ephesians 1:2-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In eternity past, God the Father’s foreknowledge knew
each believer would freely chose to accept Jesus Christ as their Savior. He
also knew that many others would reject Jesus Christ as Savior and would remain
unbelievers. Acts 2:23; Rom. 8:28-29; 1 Peter 1:2. </p>

<p class=Verses>“this Man, delivered over by the predetermined plan and
foreknowledge of God, you nailed to a cross by the hands of godless men and put
Him to death.” (Acts 2:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become
conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many
brethren; and these whom He predestined, He also called; and these whom He
called, He also justified; and these whom He justified, He also glorified.”
(Romans 8:29-30, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by the
sanctifying work of the Spirit, to obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with His
blood: May grace and peace be yours in the fullest measure.” (1 Peter 1:2,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every Church Age believer is elected to privilege and
opportunity in Christ. Rom. 8:33; Col. 3:12; 1 Thess. 1:4; Titus 1:1; 1 Peter
1:2; Eph. 1:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Who will bring a charge against God's elect? God is the one
who justifies;” (Romans 8:33, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So, as those who have been chosen of God, holy and beloved,
put on a heart of compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience;”
(Colossians 3:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“knowing, brethren beloved by God, His choice of you;” (1
Thessalonians 1:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Paul, a bond-servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ,
for the faith of those chosen of God and the knowledge of the truth which is
according to godliness,” (Titus 1:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world,
that we would be holy and blameless before Him. In love” (Ephesians 1:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We were also predestined by God. Rom. 8:29-30; Eph. 1:5;
Eph. 1:11. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become
conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many
brethren; and these whom He predestined, He also called; and these whom He
called, He also justified; and these whom He justified, He also glorified.”
(Romans 8:29-30, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to
Himself, according to the kind intention of His will,” (Ephesians 1:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“also we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined
according to His purpose who works all things after the counsel of His will,”
(Ephesians 1:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We have been chosen by God. Matt. 22:14; 1 Peter 2:4. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For many are called, but few are chosen.&quot;” (Matthew
22:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And coming to Him as to a living stone which has been rejected
by men, but is choice and precious in the sight of God,” (1 Peter 2:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We have been called by God. 1 Thess. 5:24. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Faithful is He who calls you, and He also will bring it to
pass.” (1 Thessalonians 5:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>2. Reconciliation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>The believer is reconciled <u>by
God</u> the Father because the sin barrier between man and God was removed by
the substitutionary spiritual death of Jesus Christ on the Cross for the sins
of all mankind. Because the sin barrier has been removed, eternal salvation by
faith alone in Jesus Christ alone is possible. Our Lord’s atoning work on the
Cross provides the basis of our eternal relationship with God. 2 Cor. 5:18-19;
Col. 1:20; Col. 1:22.</span></p>

<p class=Verses>“Now all these things are from God, who reconciled us to
Himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation, namely, that
God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not counting their
trespasses against them, and He has committed to us the word of
reconciliation.” (2 Corinthians 5:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and through Him to reconcile all things to Himself, having
made peace through the blood of His cross; through Him, I say, whether things
on earth or things in heaven.” (Colossians 1:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“yet He has now reconciled you in His fleshly body through
death, in order to present you before Him holy and blameless and beyond
reproach—” (Colossians 1:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>Every believer is reconciled <u>to
God</u> at the moment they believe in Christ. Rom. 5:10; 2 Cor. 5:20; Eph.
2:14-17. See category on </span><a href="#_Reconciliation">Reconciliation</a><span
style='color:black'>.</span></p>

<p class=Verses>“For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through
the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by
His life.” (Romans 5:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were
making an appeal through us; we beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to
God.” (2 Corinthians 5:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For He Himself is our peace, who made both groups into one and
broke down the barrier of the dividing wall, by abolishing in His flesh the
enmity, which is the Law of commandments contained in ordinances, so that in
Himself He might make the two into one new man, thus establishing peace, and
might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, by it having
put to death the enmity. AND HE CAME AND PREACHED PEACE TO YOU WHO WERE FAR
AWAY, AND PEACE TO THOSE WHO WERE NEAR;” (Ephesians 2:14-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>3. Redemption</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer’s faith in the work of Jesus Christ on the
Cross for salvation results in being redeemed or purchased from the “slave
market of sin.” We are all born into the slave market of sin and have no means
to win our spiritual freedom except through the substitutionary spiritual death
of Jesus Christ on the Cross. Jesus Christ paid the price of our freedom on the
Cross. Rom. 3:24; Col. 1:14; 1 Peter 1:18-19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“being justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption
which is in Christ Jesus;” (Romans 3:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.”
(Colossians 1:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable things like
silver or gold from your futile way of life inherited from your forefathers,
but with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and spotless, the blood of
Christ.” (1 Peter 1:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The physical death of Christ on the Cross occurred by an
act of His own volition, not from bleeding to death. John 10:18. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;No one has taken it away from Me, but I lay it down on
My own initiative. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to
take it up again. This commandment I received from My Father.&quot;” (John
10:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>After His atoning work on the Cross was finished, Christ
exhaled His last breath in which He uttered the words of Psalms 31:5 and Luke
23:46. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Into Your hand I commit my spirit; You have ransomed me, O
LORD, God of truth.” (Psalms 31:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And Jesus, crying out with a loud voice, said, &quot;Father,
INTO YOUR HANDS I COMMIT MY SPIRIT.&quot; Having said this, He breathed His
last.” (Luke 23:46, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Having exhaled this last sentence, Christ did not inhale
again. Christ had already completed His salvation work for us before He died
physically. Matt. 27:50; Mark 15:37; John 19:30. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and yielded up
His spirit.” (Matthew 27:50, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And Jesus uttered a loud cry, and breathed His last.” (Mark
15:37, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore when Jesus had received the sour wine, He said,
&quot;It is finished!&quot; And He bowed His head and gave up His spirit.”
(John 19:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Therefore, the Blood of Christ is part of a
representative analogy between the physical death of the animal sacrifice of
the Old Testament ritual and the spiritual death of Christ when He was bearing
our sins on the Cross. 2 Cor. 5:21; 1 Peter 2:24; Titus 2:14; Eph. 1:7. See
category on <a href="#_Redemption">Redemption</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that
we might become the righteousness of God in Him.” (2 Corinthians 5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, so that
we might die to sin and live to righteousness; for by His wounds you were
healed.” (1 Peter 2:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“who gave Himself for us to redeem us from every lawless deed,
and to purify for Himself a people for His own possession, zealous for good
deeds.” (Titus 2:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness
of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace” (Ephesians 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>4. Eternal Condemnation Removed</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer’s eternal condemnation or judgment is
removed by God the Father at the moment of salvation. We are no longer subject
to the judgment of unbelievers at the Great White Throne Judgment due to one
simple act of faith in Jesus Christ. Believers no longer share the final
destiny of Satan and all of the fallen angels in the eternal Lake of Fire. John
3:18; John 5:24; Rom. 8:1-3; Heb. 9:27-28. See category on the <a
href="#_Great_White_Throne">Great White Throne Judgment</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;He who believes in Him is not judged; he who does not
believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the
only begotten Son of God.” (John 3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears My word, and
believes Him who sent Me, has eternal life, and does not come into judgment,
but has passed out of death into life.” (John 5:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in
Christ Jesus. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you
free from the law of sin and of death. For what the Law could not do, weak as
it was through the flesh, God did: sending His own Son in the likeness of
sinful flesh and as an offering for sin, He condemned sin in the flesh,”
(Romans 8:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once and after
this comes judgment, so Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins
of many, will appear a second time for salvation without reference to sin, to
those who eagerly await Him.” (Hebrews 9:27-28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>5. Judgment For All Sins Removed</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The substitutionary spiritual death of Jesus Christ on
the Cross paid the penalty for the sins of mankind. He was judged in our place
for all of our personal sins. Whenever a believer confesses or cites their
known sins to God the Father, He is faithful and just to forgive those known
sins and also those sins that you were unaware of committing or had forgotten
about. This only happens because Christ was already judged for all sins in His
spiritual death on the Cross. From the confession of our known sins comes the
restoration to the filling of the Holy Spirit which is critical empowerment
from God to live the spiritual life. Rom. 4:25; Eph. 1:7; 1 Peter 2:24; 1 John 1:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He who was delivered over because of our transgressions, and
was raised because of our justification.” (Romans 4:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness
of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace” (Ephesians 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, so that
we might die to sin and live to righteousness; for by His wounds you were
healed.” (1 Peter 2:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>6. Propitiation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every believer receives propitiation for their sins at
salvation. Propitiation means that the just demands of God the Father were
satisfied (propitiated) by the person and work of our Lord Jesus Christ on the
Cross. The perfect righteousness of God the Father was satisfied because Jesus
Christ was perfectly sinless in His humanity. The absolute justice of God the
Father judged the humanity of Jesus Christ while on the Cross for our sins and
God the Father was satisfied with His own judgment. When we believe in Jesus
Christ as our Savior, we are the beneficiaries of that propitiation. Therefore,
God the Father is satisfied with every believer positionally. Rom. 3:24-26; 1
John 2:2; 1 John 4:10. See category on <a href="#_Propitiation">Propitiation</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“being justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption
which is in Christ Jesus; whom God displayed publicly as a propitiation in His
blood through faith. This was to demonstrate His righteousness, because in the
forbearance of God He passed over the sins previously committed; for the
demonstration, I say, of His righteousness at the present time, so that He
would be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.” (Romans
3:24-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins; and not for
ours only, but also for those of the whole world.” (1 John 2:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us
and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins.” (1 John 4:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>7. Identified with Jesus Christ </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the moment of salvation, the believer is permanently
identified with the atoning work of Jesus Christ on the Cross by God the
Father. The believer is dead to the old life, the sin nature, but alive to God.
This is called Retroactive Positional Truth. The believer is crucified with
Christ. Rom. 6:6; Gal. 2:20. </p>

<p class=Verses>“knowing this, that our old self was crucified with Him, in
order that our body of sin might be done away with, so that we would no longer
be slaves to sin;” (Romans 6:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I
who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I
live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.”
(Galatians 2:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every believer died with Christ. Rom. 6:8; Col. 3:3; 1
Pet. 2:24. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also
live with Him,” (Romans 6:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God.”
(Colossians 3:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, so that
we might die to sin and live to righteousness; for by His wounds you were
healed.” (1 Peter 2:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We were all buried with Christ and were raised with
Christ. This is called Current Positional Truth. Rom. 6:4; Col. 2:12; Rom. 7:4;
Col. 3:1. See category on <a href="#_Positional_Truth">Positional Truth</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore we have been buried with Him through baptism into
death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the
Father, so we too might walk in newness of life.” (Romans 6:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“having been buried with Him in baptism, in which you were also
raised up with Him through faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the
dead.” (Colossians 2:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, my brethren, you also were made to die to the Law
through the body of Christ, so that you might be joined to another, to Him who
was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit for God.” (Romans
7:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore if you have been raised up with Christ, keep seeking
the things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.”
(Colossians 3:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>8. Freedom From the Penalty of the Mosaic Law </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Church Age believer is free from the penalty of the Mosaic
Law. We are said to be “dead” to the Mosaic Law. Because we are placed into
union with Jesus Christ by God the Holy Spirit at salvation, when Jesus Christ
became the only human being to perfectly fulfilled the Mosaic Law during His
incarnation, we also inherit that fulfillment. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Church Age believers do not have an actual responsibility
to the Mosaic Law, but rather have responsibility to grow to spiritual maturity
where we begin to emulate much of our Lord’s perfect fulfillment of the Mosaic
Law. Rom. 7:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, my brethren, you also were made to die to the Law
through the body of Christ, so that you might be joined to another, to Him who
was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit for God.” (Romans
7:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer is also delivered or released from the
Mosaic Law and is placed under God's law of grace. Rom. 6:14; Rom 7:6; 2 Cor.
3:6-11; Gal. 3:24-25; Gal. 3:13-14; Rom. 8:2. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For sin shall not be master over you, for you are not under
law but under grace.” (Romans 6:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But now we have been released from the Law, having died to
that by which we were bound, so that we serve in newness of the Spirit and not
in oldness of the letter.” (Romans 7:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“who also made us adequate as servants of a new covenant, not
of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives
life. But if the ministry of death, in letters engraved on stones, came with
glory, so that the sons of Israel could not look intently at the face of Moses
because of the glory of his face, fading as it was, how will the ministry of
the Spirit fail to be even more with glory? For if the ministry of condemnation
has glory, much more does the ministry of righteousness abound in glory. For
indeed what had glory, in this case has no glory because of the glory that
surpasses it. For if that which fades away was with glory, much more that which
remains is in glory.” (2 Corinthians 3:6-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore the Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ,
so that we may be justified by faith. But now that faith has come, we are no
longer under a tutor.” (Galatians 3:24-25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law, having become a
curse for us—for it is written, &quot;CURSED IS EVERYONE WHO HANGS ON A
TREE&quot;— in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to
the Gentiles, so that we would receive the promise of the Spirit through
faith.” (Galatians 3:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you
free from the law of sin and of death.” (Romans 8:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>9. Regeneration</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Regeneration is God the Holy Spirit creating a human
spirit at the moment we believe in Jesus Christ. The human spirit’s function is
to make spiritual information understandable or to “spiritually appraise” the
information when the believer is filled with the Holy Spirit. Titus 3:5; 1 Cor.
2:14; 1 Cor. 6:11; Titus 3:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done in
righteousness, but according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration and
renewing by the Holy Spirit,” (Titus 3:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of
God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because
they are spiritually appraised.” (1 Corinthians 2:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Such were some of you; but you were washed, but you were
sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in
the Spirit of our God.” (1 Corinthians 6:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done in
righteousness, but according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration and
renewing by the Holy Spirit,” (Titus 3:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The human spirit is also the target for God the Father’s
imputation of eternal life to the believer at salvation. The believer is
therefore “born again” now with God’s very own eternal life. John 3:3; John 3:7;
1 Peter 1:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Jesus answered and said to him, &quot;Truly, truly, I say to
you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.&quot;” (John
3:3, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Do not be amazed that I said to you, 'You must be born
again.'” (John 3:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“for you have been born again not of seed which is perishable
but imperishable, that is, through the living and enduring word of God.” (1
Peter 1:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers become children of God, sons and daughters to
God. Rom. 8:16; John 1:12; 1 John 3:2; 2 Cor. 6:18; Gal. 3:26.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are
children of God,” (Romans 8:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to
become children of God, even to those who believe in His name,” (John 1:12,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Beloved, now we are children of God, and it has not appeared
as yet what we will be. We know that when He appears, we will be like Him,
because we will see Him just as He is.” (1 John 3:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;And I will be a father to you, And you shall be sons and
daughters to Me,&quot; Says the Lord Almighty.” (2 Corinthians 6:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.”
(Galatians 3:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer is a new creation. 2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15;
Eph. 2:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creature; the
old things passed away; behold, new things have come.” (2 Corinthians 5:17,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but
a new creation.” (Galatians 6:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good
works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.” (Ephesians
2:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>10. Royal Adoption</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer is adopted into the royal family of God at
the moment of salvation. Church Age believers are royal family by adoption, not
by birth. Our adoption into the royal family took place at the new birth. We
are adopted as adult sons because we have been placed into union with Jesus
Christ (Positional Truth) by the Holy Spirit. The moment you believed in
Christ, you became a member of the royal family of God forever. We will all
have a future adoption at our resurrection at the Rapture of the Church. Eph.
1:5; Rom. 8:15; Rom. 8:23; Eph. 2:19; Eph. 3:5-6; Gal. 6:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to
Himself, according to the kind intention of His will,” (Ephesians 1:5, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“No one has seen God at any time; the only begotten God who is
in the bosom of the Father, He has explained Him.” (John 1:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And not only this, but also we ourselves, having the first
fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting eagerly
for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our body.” (Romans 8:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are
fellow citizens with the saints, and are of God's household,” (Ephesians 2:19,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“which in other generations was not made known to the sons of
men, as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in the
Spirit; to be specific, that the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members
of the body, and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the
gospel,” (Ephesians 3:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So then, while we have opportunity, let us do good to all
people, and especially to those who are of the household of the faith.”
(Galatians 6:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The royal family of God is unique to the Church Age. The
Lord Jesus Christ is royalty with three royal titles. His first royal title is
divine royalty as the God the Son, the revealed member of the Trinity. His divine
royal family is God the Father and God the Holy Spirit. John 1:18; John 6:46; 1
Tim. 6:16; 1 John 4:12.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“No one has seen God at any time; the only begotten God who is
in the bosom of the Father, He has explained Him.” (John 1:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Not that anyone has seen the Father, except the One who
is from God; He has seen the Father.” (John 6:46, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“who alone possesses immortality and dwells in unapproachable
light, whom no man has seen or can see. To Him be honor and eternal dominion!
Amen.” (1 Timothy 6:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“No one has seen God at any time; if we love one another, God
abides in us, and His love is perfected in us.” (1 John 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ’s second royal title is human royalty as the
Son of David. His royal family is the dynasty of David. Rom. 1:3-4</p>

<p class=Verses>“concerning His Son, who was born of a descendant of David
according to the flesh, who was declared the Son of God with power by the
resurrection from the dead, according to the Spirit of holiness, Jesus Christ
our Lord,” (Romans 1:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord’s third royal title is the King of kings and
Lord of lords. When the resurrected Jesus Christ ascended into the third
heaven, God the Father said to the humanity of Jesus Christ, “Sit down at My
right hand, and I will make Your enemies Your footstool.” God the Father then
declared our Lord’s His third royal title of King of kings and Lord of lords. Because
our Lord had no royal family, the Church Age was inserted into human history
for the purpose of calling out a royal family of God for Him. 1 Tim. 6:15; 1
Tim. 1:17; Rev. 17:14; Rev. 19:16.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“which He will bring about at the proper time—He who is the
blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords,” (1 Timothy
6:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be
honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.” (1 Timothy 1:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;These will wage war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will
overcome them, because He is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those who are
with Him are the called and chosen and faithful.&quot;” (Revelation 17:14,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And on His robe and on His thigh He has a name written,
&quot;KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.&quot;” (Revelation 19:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>11. We are Made Acceptable to God </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer is made acceptable to God at salvation. Eph.
1:6; 1 Peter 2:5. </p>

<p class=Verses>“to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely
bestowed on us in the Beloved.” (Ephesians 1:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“you also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual
house for a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
through Jesus Christ.” (1 Peter 2:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer is made righteous by imputation of God the
Father’s very own absolute righteousness. Rom. 3:22; 1 Cor. 1:30; 2 Cor. 5:21;
Phil. 3:9. </p>

<p class=Verses>“even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ
for all those who believe; for there is no distinction;” (Romans 3:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But by His doing you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us
wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption,” (1
Corinthians 1:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that
we might become the righteousness of God in Him.” (2 Corinthians 5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and may be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own
derived from the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the
righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith,” (Philippians 3:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer is sanctified positionally. 1 Cor. 1:30; 1
Cor. 6:11. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But by His doing you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us
wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption,” (1
Corinthians 1:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Such were some of you; but you were washed, but you were
sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in
the Spirit of our God.” (1 Corinthians 6:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer is perfected forever and the believer is
qualified for inheritance. Heb. 10:14; Col. 1:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For by one offering He has perfected for all time those who
are sanctified.” (Hebrews 10:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified us to share in
the inheritance of the saints in Light.” (Colossians 1:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>12. We are Justified and Declared Righteous </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the moment of faith alone in Jesus Christ alone, God
the Father imputes His very own perfect righteousness to our soul. God the
Father then declares us righteous. With the righteousness of God imputed, we
are justified. Rom 3:28; Rom. 4:1-5; Rom. 4:25; Gal 2:1<span style='color:black'>6;
Phil 3:9; Titus 3:7; </span>Rom. 5:1-2; 1 Cor. 6:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to
boast about, but not before God. For what does the Scripture say? &quot;ABRAHAM
BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS CREDITED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS.&quot;” (Romans
4:2-3, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who
justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness,” (Romans 4:5,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from
works of the Law.” (Romans 3:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He who was delivered over because of our transgressions, and
was raised because of our justification.” (Romans 4:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“nevertheless knowing that a man is not justified by the works
of the Law but through faith in Christ Jesus, even we have believed in Christ
Jesus, so that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of
the Law; since by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified.” (Galatians
2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and may be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own
derived from the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the
righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith,” (Philippians 3:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“so that being justified by His grace we would be made heirs
according to the hope of eternal life.” (Titus 3:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with
God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom also we have obtained our
introduction by faith into this grace in which we stand; and we exult in hope
of the glory of God.” (Romans 5:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Such were some of you; but you were washed, but you were
sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in
the Spirit of our God.” (1 Corinthians 6:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The justice of God the Father was satisfied with the
substitutionary spiritual death of Jesus Christ on the Cross. Our Lord’s
payment for the sins of all mankind was found to be perfectly righteous by God
the Father. Rom. 3:22-24; Rom. 5:9; Rom 8:30; 1 Cor 1:30.</p>

<p class=Verses>“even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ
for all those who believe; for there is no distinction; for all have sinned and
fall short of the glory of God, being justified as a gift by His grace through
the redemption which is in Christ Jesus;” (Romans 3:22-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we
shall be saved from the wrath of God through Him.” (Romans 5:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But by His doing you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us
wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption,” (1
Corinthians 1:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divine righteousness is imputed from God the Father to
our souls at the same time we share the righteousness of Christ through
Positional Truth. Through this “double portion” of righteousness, we are made
righteous. Rom. 4:3-5; 2 Cor. 5:21; Rom. 3:25-26.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For what does the Scripture say? &quot;ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD,
AND IT WAS CREDITED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS.&quot; Now to the one who works,
his wage is not credited as a favor, but as what is due. But to the one who
does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is
credited as righteousness,” (Romans 4:3-5, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“whom God displayed publicly as a propitiation in His blood
through faith. This was to demonstrate His righteousness, because in the
forbearance of God He passed over the sins previously committed; for the
demonstration, I say, of His righteousness at the present time, so that He
would be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.” (Romans
3:25-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that
we might become the righteousness of God in Him.” (2 Corinthians 5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>13. We Have Unique Availability of Divine Power </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the moment of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ,
the Church Age believer receives the unique availability of divine power. God
the Holy Spirit provides the enabling power for the believer’s spiritual life
including the ability to understand and apply Bible doctrine, to grow
spiritually, and thereby execute the plan of God. In addition, God the Father’s
omnipotence provides His grace resources and blessings to the believer and God
the Son’s omnipotence continues to uphold the universe and perpetuate human
history. 2 Peter 1:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“seeing that His divine power has granted to us everything
pertaining to life and godliness, through the true knowledge of Him who called
us by His own glory and excellence.” (2 Peter 1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>14. We Gain Heavenly Citizenship</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All Church Age believers are made heavenly citizens at
the moment of salvation. We become members of the Royal Family of God and our
seat of citizenship is in heaven. Phil. 3:20-21; Eph. 2:19; Heb. 12:22-23; Luke
10:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For our citizenship is in heaven, from which also we eagerly
wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ; who will transform the body of our
humble state into conformity with the body of His glory, by the exertion of the
power that He has even to subject all things to Himself.” (Philippians 3:20-21,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are
fellow citizens with the saints, and are of God's household,” (Ephesians 2:19,
NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living
God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels, to the general assembly
and church of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God, the Judge
of all, and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect,” (Hebrews 12:22-23,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Nevertheless do not rejoice in this, that the spirits
are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are recorded in heaven.&quot;”
(Luke 10:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>15. We are Delivered From the Power of Satan’s Kingdom</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At salvation, the believer is delivered from the power of
Satan’s world kingdom of evil. The unbeliever remains under the power of Satan
and His world system of evil and the control of the old sin nature. Col. 1:13a;
Col. 2:15; 1 John 5:19; Eph. 2:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For He rescued us from the domain of darkness, and transferred
us to the kingdom of His beloved Son,” (Colossians 1:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“When He had disarmed the rulers and authorities, He made a
public display of them, having triumphed over them through Him.” (Colossians
2:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“We know that we are of God, and that the whole world lies in
the power of the evil one.” (1 John 5:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And you were dead in your trespasses and sins, in which you
formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince
of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of
disobedience.” (Ephesians 2:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, take up the full armor of God, so that you will be
able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm.
Stand firm therefore, HAVING GIRDED YOUR LOINS WITH TRUTH, and HAVING PUT ON
THE BREASTPLATE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS, and having shod YOUR FEET WITH THE
PREPARATION OF THE GOSPEL OF PEACE; in addition to all, taking up the shield of
faith with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming arrows of the
evil one. And take THE HELMET OF SALVATION, and the sword of the Spirit, which
is the word of God.” (Ephesians 6:13-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>16. We are Transferred into the Kingdom of God </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the moment of salvation, the believer is transferred
into the kingdom of God because we have also been redeemed by the work of Jesus
Christ on the Cross for our sins and because we are now in union with Him
forever. Col. 1:13-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For He rescued us from the domain of darkness, and transferred
us to the kingdom of His beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the
forgiveness of sins.” (Colossians 1:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>17. We Have a Secure Foundation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer at salvation is immediately placed on a
secure foundation with an eternal relationship with Jesus Christ. No one can
remove the believer from that relationship, not even God because He is
immutable. 1 Cor. 3:11; 2 Cor. 1:21-22; 1 Cor. 10:4; Eph. 2:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For no man can lay a foundation other than the one which is
laid, which is Jesus Christ.” (1 Corinthians 3:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now He who establishes us with you in Christ and anointed us
is God, who also sealed us and gave us the Spirit in our hearts as a pledge.”
(2 Corinthians 1:21-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and all drank the same spiritual drink, for they were drinking
from a spiritual rock which followed them; and the rock was Christ.” (1
Corinthians 10:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“having been built on the foundation of the apostles and
prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the corner stone,” (Ephesians 2:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>18. We Are a Gift From God the Father to Christ </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every believer is a gift from God the Father to Jesus Christ.
As with all things that God does, each gift is permanent and can never be taken
back. John 10:29; John 17:2; John 17:6; John 17:9; John 17:11-12; John 17:24.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than
all; and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand.” (John 10:29,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“even as You gave Him authority over all flesh, that to all
whom You have given Him, He may give eternal life.” (John 17:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I have manifested Your name to the men whom You gave Me
out of the world; they were Yours and You gave them to Me, and they have kept
Your word.” (John 17:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I ask on their behalf; I do not ask on behalf of the
world, but of those whom You have given Me; for they are Yours;” (John 17:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I am no longer in the world; and yet they themselves are
in the world, and I come to You. Holy Father, keep them in Your name, the name
which You have given Me, that they may be one even as We are. &quot;While I was
with them, I was keeping them in Your name which You have given Me; and I
guarded them and not one of them perished but the son of perdition, so that the
Scripture would be fulfilled.” (John 17:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Father, I desire that they also, whom You have given Me,
be with Me where I am, so that they may see My glory which You have given Me,
for You loved Me before the foundation of the world.” (John 17:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>19. We are Delivered From the Domination of the Old Sin
Nature </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer is delivered positionally from the power or
domination of the old sin nature. After salvation, every time the believer
chooses to sin, their soul becomes controlled by the old sin nature and are in
a state of carnality. When the believer names or cites their known sins to God
the Father, He forgives those sins and removes all unrighteousness resulting in
our soul being again controlled by the Holy Spirit. This process is repeated
many many times as the believer grows spiritually. Rom. 8:2; Phil. 3:3<span

<p class=Verses>“For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you
free from the law of sin and of death.” (Romans 8:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“for we are the true circumcision, who worship in the Spirit of
God and glory in Christ Jesus and put no confidence in the flesh,” (Philippians
3:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and in Him you were also circumcised with a circumcision made
without hands, in the removal of the body of the flesh by the circumcision of
Christ;” (Colossians 2:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that
which is of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter; and his praise is not
from men, but from God.” (Romans 2:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“that, in reference to your former manner of life, you lay
aside the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of
deceit, and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind, and put on the new
self, which in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and
holiness of the truth.” (Ephesians 4:22-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>20. We are Appointed Royal Priests Unto God </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the moment of salvation, every Church Age believer is
appointed a priest unto God. This is unique to the Church Age. We are a holy
priesthood and a royal priesthood. As a priest, the believer represent
themselves directly to God without any intermediary. When we confess our known
sins, it is directly to God the Father. There is no priest between you and God.
1 Pet. 2:5; 1 Pet. 2:9; Rev. 1:6; Rev. 5:10; Rev. 20:6. </p>

<p class=Verses>“you also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual
house for a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
through Jesus Christ.” (1 Peter 2:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But you are A CHOSEN RACE, A royal PRIESTHOOD, A HOLY NATION,
A PEOPLE FOR God's OWN POSSESSION, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of
Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;” (1 Peter 2:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and He has made us to be a kingdom, priests to His God and
Father—to Him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen.”
(Revelation 1:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to our
God; and they will reign upon the earth.&quot;” (Revelation 5:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Blessed and holy is the one who has a part in the first
resurrection; over these the second death has no power, but they will be
priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years.”
(Revelation 20:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>21. We Have Eternal Security </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the point of salvation belief in Jesus Christ, the
believer has eternal security. No one is capable of reversing or breaking our
eternal relationship with Jesus Christ, not even God, not even ourselves. Once
God the Holy Spirit places us in union with Jesus Christ, it cannot be broken.
Once we are born again as sons of God, we are in God's family and can never be
unborn.  There is nothing we can do to be bad enough to lose our salvation. We
are eternally secure in Jesus Christ. John 10:28-29; Rom. 8:38-39; Rom. 8:32;
Gal. 3:26; 2 Tim. 2:13; 1 Peter 1:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and I give eternal life to them, and they will never perish;
and no one will snatch them out of My hand. &quot;My Father, who has given them
to Me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of the
Father's hand.” (John 10:28-29, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels,
nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor
height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us
from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Romans 8:38-39,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him over for
us all, how will He not also with Him freely give us all things?” (Romans 8:32,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.”
(Galatians 3:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny
Himself.” (2 Timothy 2:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“who are protected by the power of God through faith for a
salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.” (1 Peter 1:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>22. We Have Direct Access to God</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At salvation, the believer is given direct access to God.
When we pray to God the Father, we have direct access. There is no intermediary
to go through. We have this direct access because our Lord Jesus Christ at the
Father’s right hand in the third heaven is our great High Priest. He intercedes
for us. He is our advocate. His is our representative and surety that we will
live with God for eternity. Rom. 5:2; Eph. 2:18; Heb. 4:16; Heb. 10:19-20; Heb.
4:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“through whom also we have obtained our introduction by faith
into this grace in which we stand; and we exult in hope of the glory of God.”
(Romans 5:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“for through Him we both have our access in one Spirit to the
Father.” (Ephesians 2:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore let us draw near with confidence to the throne of
grace, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.”
(Hebrews 4:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, brethren, since we have confidence to enter the
holy place by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way which He inaugurated
for us through the veil, that is, His flesh,” (Hebrews 10:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed
through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.”
(Hebrews 4:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>23. We are Under God’s Grace Care</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every believer is within the “much more” grace care of
God. Rom. 5:9-10. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we
shall be saved from the wrath of God through Him. For if while we were enemies
we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been
reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.” (Romans 5:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are objects of His love. Eph. 2:4; Eph. 5:2. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with
which He loved us,” (Ephesians 2:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and walk in love, just as Christ also loved you and gave
Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma.”
(Ephesians 5:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are objects of His grace for salvation. Eph. 2:8-9. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not
of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one
may boast.” (Ephesians 2:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are objects of His grace for protection. Rom. 5:2; 1
Pet. 1:5. </p>

<p class=Verses>“through whom also we have obtained our introduction by faith
into this grace in which we stand; and we exult in hope of the glory of God.”
(Romans 5:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“who are protected by the power of God through faith for a
salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.” (1 Peter 1:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are objects of His grace for service. John 17:18; Eph.
4:7.</p>

<p class=Verses> “&quot;As You sent Me into the world, I also have sent them
into the world.” (John 17:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure
of Christ's gift.” (Ephesians 4:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are objects of His grace for instruction. Titus
2:11-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all
men, instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires and to live
sensibly, righteously and godly in the present age,” (Titus 2:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are objects of His power. Eph. 1:19; Phil. 2:13. </p>

<p class=Verses>“and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us
who believe. These are in accordance with the working of the strength of His
might” (Ephesians 1:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“for it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work
for His good pleasure.” (Philippians 2:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are objects of His faithfulness. Phil. 1:6; Heb. 13:5.
</p>

<p class=Verses>“For I am confident of this very thing, that He who began a
good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus.” (Philippians
1:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Make sure that your character is free from the love of money,
being content with what you have; for He Himself has said, &quot;I WILL NEVER
DESERT YOU, NOR WILL I EVER FORSAKE YOU,&quot;” (Hebrews 13:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are objects of His peace. John 14:27, Col 3:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Peace I leave with you; My peace I give to you; not as
the world gives do I give to you. Do not let your heart be troubled, nor let it
be fearful.” (John 14:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed
you were called in one body; and be thankful.” (Colossians 3:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are objects of His eternal comfort. 2 Thess. 2:16. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself and God our Father, who
has loved us and given us eternal comfort and good hope by grace,” (2
Thessalonians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are objects of His intercession. Rom. 8:34; Heb. 7:25;
Heb 9:24. </p>

<p class=Verses>“who is the one who condemns? Christ Jesus is He who died, yes,
rather who was raised, who is at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for
us.” (Romans 8:34, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore He is able also to save forever those who draw near
to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them.”
(Hebrews 7:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For Christ did not enter a holy place made with hands, a mere
copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of
God for us;” (Hebrews 9:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>24. We Have An Eternal Inheritance</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the moment we believe in Christ, every believer becomes
an heir of God and shares the destiny of Jesus Christ as joint heirs. Every
Church Age believer in Jesus Christ is permanently in union with Christ. The
Lord Jesus Christ is the heir of God. His heirship becomes our heirship because
we are in Him. Rom. 8:17; Eph. 1:14; Eph. 1:18; Col. 3:24; Eph. 3:6; Heb. 9:15;
Gal. 4:6-7; Gal. 3:29; 1 Peter 1:4; 1 Peter 3:7. See category on <a
href="#_Heirship_(Inheritance)">Heirship (Inheritance)</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and if children, heirs also, heirs of God and fellow heirs
with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him so that we may also be glorified with
Him.” (Romans 8:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“who is given as a pledge of our inheritance, with a view to
the redemption of God's own possession, to the praise of His glory.” (Ephesians
1:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, so that
you will know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory
of His inheritance in the saints,” (Ephesians 1:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason He is the mediator of a new covenant, so that,
since a death has taken place for the redemption of the transgressions that
were committed under the first covenant, those who have been called may receive
the promise of the eternal inheritance.” (Hebrews 9:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son
into our hearts, crying, &quot;Abba! Father!&quot; Therefore you are no longer
a slave, but a son; and if a son, then an heir through God.” (Galatians 4:6-7,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“to obtain an inheritance which is imperishable and undefiled
and will not fade away, reserved in heaven for you,” (1 Peter 1:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>25. We Have a New Position in Christ - Positional Sanctification</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every believer has a new position in Christ because God
the Holy Spirit placed us into union with Jesus Christ at the point of faith
belief in Jesus Christ for salvation. This is also called the Baptism of the
Holy Spirit. The believer’s resulting position in Christ is called Positional
Sanctification. Positional Sanctification makes every Church Age believer in
union with Jesus Christ positionally higher than all angels. Eph. 2:6. See
category on the <a href="#_D-Baptism_of_the_1">Baptism of the Holy Spirit</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and raised us up with Him, and seated us with Him in the
heavenly places in Christ Jesus,” (Ephesians 2:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are partners with Christ in life. Col. 3:4; 1 John
5:11-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“When Christ, who is our life, is revealed, then you also will
be revealed with Him in glory.” (Colossians 3:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the testimony is this, that God has given us eternal life,
and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has the life; he who does not
have the Son of God does not have the life.” (1 John 5:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are partners or in fellowship with Christ in service
and divine good production. This applies to fellowship with other believers and
fellowship with God the Holy Spirit, God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ. 1
Cor. 1:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“God is faithful, through whom you were called into fellowship
with His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.” (1 Corinthians 1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are workers together with God. 1 Cor. 3:9; 2 Cor. 6:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For we are God's fellow workers; you are God's field, God's
building.” (1 Corinthians 3:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And working together with Him, we also urge you not to receive
the grace of God in vain—” (2 Corinthians 6:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are servants of the New Covenant. 2 Cor. 3:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“who also made us adequate as servants of a new covenant, not
of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives
life.” (2 Corinthians 3:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every Church Age believer at the moment of salvation is
appointed a royal ambassador for Jesus Christ. As an ambassador, the believer
represents our Lord Jesus Christ on earth. Part of the believer’s
responsibility is to present the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the unbeliever. 2
Cor. 5:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were
making an appeal through us; we beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to
God.” (2 Corinthians 5:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are living letters of Christ. 2 Cor. 3:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“being manifested that you are a letter of Christ, cared for by
us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets
of stone but on tablets of human hearts.” (2 Corinthians 3:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are servants of God. 2 Cor. 6:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but in everything commending ourselves as servants of God, in
much endurance, in afflictions, in hardships, in distresses,” (2 Corinthians
6:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer is a partner with Christ in suffering. Our
suffering can be either undeserved or deserved and is designed to accelerate
the believer’s spiritual growth by relying only on God's grace resources under
the filling of the Holy Spirit to handle the suffering. Spiritual growth
results in God conveying blessing to the believer while on earth and in
eternity. We will suffer on behalf of Christ in this life and reign with Him in
eternity. 2 Tim. 2:12; Phil. 1:29; 1 Peter 2:20; 1 Peter 4:12-13; 1 Thess. 3:3;
Rom. 8:18; Col. 1:24.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we endure, we will also reign with Him; If we deny Him, He
also will deny us;” (2 Timothy 2:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For to you it has been granted for Christ's sake, not only to
believe in Him, but also to suffer for His sake,” (Philippians 1:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For what credit is there if, when you sin and are harshly
treated, you endure it with patience? But if when you do what is right and
suffer for it you patiently endure it, this finds favor with God.” (1 Peter
2:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you,
which comes upon you for your testing, as though some strange thing were
happening to you; but to the degree that you share the sufferings of Christ,
keep on rejoicing, so that also at the revelation of His glory you may rejoice
with exultation.” (1 Peter 4:12-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“so that no one would be disturbed by these afflictions; for
you yourselves know that we have been destined for this.” (1 Thessalonians 3:3,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are
not worthy to be compared with the glory that is to be revealed to us.” (Romans
8:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh
I do my share on behalf of His body, which is the church, in filling up what is
lacking in Christ's afflictions.” (Colossians 1:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>26. We Receive God’s Eternal Life</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers are recipients of God's eternal life. Eternal
life is living in the presence of God forever. Believers receive the imputation
of eternal life from God the Father to their newly acquired human spirit. We
also share the eternal life of Jesus Christ through Positional Truth. This is
our double portion of eternal life. John 3:15-16; John 10:28; John 3:36; John
10:28; John 6:47; John 20:31; 1 John 5:11-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“so that whoever believes will in Him have eternal life.
&quot;For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that
whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.” (John
3:15-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and I give eternal life to them, and they will never perish;
and no one will snatch them out of My hand.” (John 10:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who
does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on
him.&quot;” (John 3:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and I give eternal life to them, and they will never perish;
and no one will snatch them out of My hand.” (John 10:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes has eternal
life.” (John 6:47, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“but these have been written so that you may believe that Jesus
is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing you may have life in His
name.” (John 20:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the testimony is this, that God has given us eternal life,
and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has the life; he who does not
have the Son of God does not have the life. These things I have written to you
who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have
eternal life.” (1 John 5:11-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>27. We are New Spiritual Creatures </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Church Age believer becomes a new spiritual creature at
the moment of faith in Christ. This is unique to the Church Age. 2 Cor. 5:17;
Gal. 6:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creature; the
old things passed away; behold, new things have come.” (2 Corinthians 5:17,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but
a new creation.” (Galatians 6:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>28. We are a Light in The Lord</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer is a light in the Lord because we are placed
into union with Jesus Christ by the Holy Spirit at salvation. Jesus Christ is
the Light of the world. Positionally, we are eternally in union with Jesus
Christ. As we live the spiritual life, we are either “walking in the light” in
fellowship with God where the Holy Spirit controls our soul or we are “walking
in darkness” or carnal where the old sin nature controls our soul. John 1:4;
Eph. 5:8; 1 Thess. 5:4-5; Matt. 5:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“In Him was life, and the life was the Light of men.” (John
1:4, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“for you were formerly darkness, but now you are Light in the
Lord; walk as children of Light” (Ephesians 5:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But you, brethren, are not in darkness, that the day would
overtake you like a thief; for you are all sons of light and sons of day. We
are not of night nor of darkness;” (1 Thessalonians 5:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill
cannot be hidden;” (Matthew 5:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>29. We are United to The Father, Son and Holy Spirit</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the moment of salvation, the believer is united with
the God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. We are in God and God
is in each believer. We are indwelt by God the Father. We are indwelt by God
the Son. We are in Christ. Christ is in you. We are indwelt by God the Holy Spirit.
This indwelling is permanent and cannot be changed. It is also independent of
whether the believer is spiritual or carnal. Only Church Age believers are
united with each member of the Godhead. Eph. 4:6; Col. 1:27; Rom. 8:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and
in all.” (Ephesians 4:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“to whom God willed to make known what is the riches of the
glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of
glory.” (Colossians 1:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“However, you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed
the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if anyone does not have the Spirit of
Christ, he does not belong to Him.” (Romans 8:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Indwelling of God the Father</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every Church Age believer is indwelt by God the Father at
the moment of salvation to provide a guarantee to every believer of God's unseen
grace resources for living the Christian life. This is a guarantee of His
personal ministry to every believer. God the Father indwells the body of every
Church Age believer to glorify His plan for the Church Age. His indwelling is
assurance of His work in eternity past on behalf of each Church Age believer.
John 14:23; Eph. 4:6; 2 John 1:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Jesus answered and said to him, &quot;If anyone loves Me, he
will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and
make Our abode with him.” (John 14:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and
in all.” (Ephesians 4:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Anyone who goes too far and does not abide in the teaching of
Christ, does not have God; the one who abides in the teaching, he has both the
Father and the Son.” (2 John 1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The indwelling of God the Father provides blessings to
the believer while on earth and in eternity. God the Father indwells us in
order that these might become a reality. His presence guarantees the
availability of those blessings.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He has designed the spiritual life for every Church Age
believer by which we execute His plan, purpose, and will for our lives. He is
the author of the plan of God. Part of that perfect plan is an individual plan
and ministry for every Church Age believer. The indwelling of God the Father
glorifies His plan for the Church Age. Eph. 1:3; Eph. 1:6; Eph. 1:12.<span

<p class=Verses>“Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ,”
(Ephesians 1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely
bestowed on us in the Beloved.” (Ephesians 1:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“to the end that we who were the first to hope in Christ would
be to the praise of His glory.” (Ephesians 1:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Indwelling of God the Son</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The deity of Jesus Christ as the Shekinah Glory indwells
the body of every Church Age believer. This is unique in human history. For the
Church Age, Jesus Christ is not visible to mankind on earth and will continue
to reside in the third heaven until the Rapture of the Church. The indwelling
of the deity of Jesus Christ as the Shekinah Glory is our guarantee that God
will provide His unlimited grace resources including the enabling divine power
of the Holy Spirit who empowers the believer to live the spiritual life and to
fulfill God's plan for their life. Rom. 8:10; John 14:20; Col. 1:27.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin,
yet the spirit is alive because of righteousness.” (Romans 8:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and
you in Me, and I in you.” (John 14:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“to whom God willed to make known what is the riches of the
glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of
glory.” (Colossians 1:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The indwelling of Jesus Christ is a sign that every
Church Age believer is a member of the family of God, a royal priesthood. The
indwelling of Jesus Christ is the basis for the believer assigning top priority
to their relationship with God over relationships with people. This
relationship is tested by our attitude toward Bible doctrine. 2 Cor. 13:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Test yourselves to see if you are in the faith; examine
yourselves! Or do you not recognize this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is
in you—unless indeed you fail the test?” (2 Corinthians 13:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The indwelling of the deity of Jesus Christ as the
Shekinah Glory is our guarantee that divine blessings will be given to the
believer who advances in the spiritual life and fulfills the plan of God for
their lives. The indwelling of Jesus Christ guarantees our eternal security,
our eternal life after death and a resurrection body at the Rapture of the
Church and into eternity. John 17:22-23; Gal. 2:20; 1 John 2:24.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;The glory which You have given Me I have given to them,
that they may be one, just as We are one; I in them and You in Me, that they
may be perfected in unity, so that the world may know that You sent Me, and
loved them, even as You have loved Me.” (John 17:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I
who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I
live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.”
(Galatians 2:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“As for you, let that abide in you which you heard from the
beginning. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, you also will
abide in the Son and in the Father.” (1 John 2:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the moment of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ,
the Church Age believer becomes related to God the Son. We are members of the Body
of Christ because we are in union with the Lord Jesus Christ. 1 Cor. 12:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether
Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one
Spirit.” (1 Corinthians 12:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are the branches and Jesus Christ is the vine. John
15:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me
and I in him, he bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing.” (John
15:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are the stones in the building where Jesus Christ is
the Chief Cornerstone. Eph. 2:21-22; 1 Peter 2:5. </p>

<p class=Verses>“in whom the whole building, being fitted together, is growing
into a holy temple in the Lord, in whom you also are being built together into
a dwelling of God in the Spirit.” (Ephesians 2:21-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“you also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual
house for a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
through Jesus Christ.” (1 Peter 2:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are the sheep in the flock where Jesus Christ is the
Great Shepherd. John 10:27-29.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow
Me; and I give eternal life to them, and they will never perish; and no one
will snatch them out of My hand. &quot;My Father, who has given them to Me, is
greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand.”
(John 10:27-29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are members of His bride - the Bride of Christ. Our
wedding occurs at the Second Advent. Eph. 5:25-27; Rev. 19:6-8; Rev. 21:9. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the
church and gave Himself up for her, so that He might sanctify her, having
cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, that He might present to
Himself the church in all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle or any such
thing; but that she would be holy and blameless.” (Ephesians 5:25-27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then I heard something like the voice of a great multitude and
like the sound of many waters and like the sound of mighty peals of thunder,
saying, &quot;Hallelujah! For the Lord our God, the Almighty, reigns. &quot;Let
us rejoice and be glad and give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb
has come and His bride has made herself ready.&quot; It was given to her to
clothe herself in fine linen, bright and clean; for the fine linen is the
righteous acts of the saints.” (Revelation 19:6-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of
the seven last plagues came and spoke with me, saying, &quot;Come here, I will
show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.&quot;” (Revelation 21:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are all priests of the kingdom of priests where Jesus
Christ is the Great High Priest and we are members of the royal priesthood. Christ
indwells us to motivate us to keep advancing spiritually. If you understand the
doctrine of the indwelling of Christ, you will have the capacity to enjoy your
grace blessings without being destroyed from lack of capacity. 1 Peter 2:5. See
category on <a href="#_Jesus_Christ,_Indwelling">Jesus Christ, Indwelling</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“you also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual
house for a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
through Jesus Christ.” (1 Peter 2:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Indwelling of God the Holy Spirit</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>From the moment of salvation onward, God the Holy Spirit permanently
indwells the body of every Church Age believer. The Holy Spirit indwells the
body of every Church Age believer to make their bodies a suitable temple for
the indwelling of the deity of Jesus Christ as the Shekinah Glory and a
permanent residence for the indwelling of God the Father. The Holy Spirit also
indwells the body of every Church Age believer to provide a base of operation
for the use of His omnipotence to empower the believer’s spiritual life via the
filling of the Holy Spirit. The believer can then grow spiritually and execute
the plan of God in the spiritual life. John 7:39; Rom. 5:5; Rom. 8:9; Rom. 8:11;
John 14:17; 1 Cor. 3:16; 1 Cor. 6:19-20; Gal. 3:2; Gal. 4:6; 1 John 3:24; 1 Cor.
2:12; 2 Cor. 1:21; 2 Cor. 6:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But this He spoke of the Spirit, whom those who believed in
Him were to receive; for the Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not
yet glorified.” (John 7:39, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“However, you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed
the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if anyone does not have the Spirit of
Christ, he does not belong to Him.” (Romans 8:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“that is the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive,
because it does not see Him or know Him, but you know Him because He abides
with you and will be in you.” (John 14:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy
Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and that you are not your own?
For you have been bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body.” (1
Corinthians 6:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The one who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in
him. We know by this that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He has given us.”
(1 John 3:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Or what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For we are
the temple of the living God; just as God said, &quot;I WILL DWELL IN THEM AND
WALK AMONG THEM; AND I WILL BE THEIR GOD, AND THEY SHALL BE MY PEOPLE.” (2
Corinthians 6:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>30. We are Recipients of the Holy Spirit’s Seven
Salvation Ministries</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Every Church Age believer is the recipient of the seven
salvation ministries of the Holy Spirit. <span style='color:black'>None of
these functions or ministries make you feel better or feel differently.
Although you may have had an emotional experience when you first believed in
Jesus Christ, none of the Holy Spirit salvation ministries are associated with
an emotional response. These seven salvation ministries form the basis for
unity among believers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Holy Spirit provides the empowerment for each of us
to live the spiritual life. Without Him, we could not have become saved even
though we had positive faith belief, we could not learn any divine truths, and
we could never have fellowship with God. Without His divine power in each of
us, would have no power to function spiritually.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Holy Spirit is the Agent of Regeneration </u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>God the Holy Spirit is the agent of regeneration and acts in
a two-step process whenever the Gospel is presented to an unbeliever. Salvation
is all about God's grace. Since the unbeliever is spiritually dead and cannot
understand spiritual things, God the Holy Spirit makes the Gospel clear and
understandable to them. If the unbeliever expresses their free will to choose
for Jesus Christ as Savior, the Holy Spirit takes their positive faith belief
in Christ and carries that faith to the point of salvation. Without the
ministry of God the Holy Spirit at salvation, none of us would have eternal
salvation. John 10:27-28; Eph. 1:13-14; Eph. 2:8-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they
follow Me; and I give eternal life to them, and they will never perish; and no
one will snatch them out of My hand. &quot;  (John 10:27-28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;In Him, you also, after listening to the message of
truth, the gospel of your salvation—having also believed, you were sealed in
Him with the Holy Spirit of promise, who is given as a pledge of our
inheritance, with a view to the redemption of God's own possession, to the
praise of His glory.&quot;  (Ephesians 1:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that
not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no
one may boast.&quot;  (Ephesians 2:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Believer Receives a Human Spirit - Regeneration</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Holy Spirit, in His salvation ministry, creates a
human spirit for each believer and imputes or provides it to them. This is so
that you have the spiritual apparatus – the grace apparatus for perception necessary
for the intake of the Word of God. This is called Regeneration. Titus 3:5; 1
Peter 1:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done
in righteousness, but according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration
and renewing by the Holy Spirit,&quot;  (Titus 3:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;for you have been born again not of seed which is
perishable but imperishable, that is, through the living and enduring word of
God.&quot;  (1 Peter 1:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Regeneration is the technical term for being “born again.”
Being born again is a result of faith in Jesus Christ occurring at the instant
you personally believed in Jesus Christ. The moment God the Holy Spirit creates
a human spirit, God the Father imputes eternal life to that human spirit. The
unbeliever has no human spirit and is called a “natural” man. 1 Cor. 2:14; John
3:6-7. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But a natural man does not accept the things of the
Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them,
because they are spiritually appraised.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 2:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that
which is born of the Spirit is spirit. &quot;Do not be amazed that I said to
you, 'You must be born again.' &quot;  (John 3:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Baptism of the Holy Spirit </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every believer in the Church Age is placed into union with
Jesus Christ at the moment of salvation by the Holy Spirit. The word baptism
means to be “identified with.” We become identified with the Lord Jesus Christ
at the point of salvation. As a result of being in union with Christ, we share
what Christ has. We share His eternal life, His righteousness, His destiny, His
election, and His royalty. We are identified with the Lord Jesus Christ as He
is seated at the Father's right hand. This is called Positional Truth. 1 Cor.
12:13; Eph 4:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body,
whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink
of one Spirit.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 12:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;one Lord, one faith, one baptism,&quot;  (Ephesians 4:5,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 12:13, the phrase “we were all baptized”
states that all are baptized, not just some. The phrase “For by one Spirit we
were all baptized into one body” means the Holy Spirit did all the work and we
all become members of the Body of Christ.  All believers were baptized by one
Spirit into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, slaves or free. The phrase “we
were all made to drink of one Spirit” refers to the indwelling of the Holy
Spirit. Gal. 3:26-28.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ
Jesus. For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves
with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free
man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ
Jesus.&quot;  (Galatians 3:26-28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer’s union with Christ resulting from the Baptism
of the Holy Spirit is permanent. You can never get out. There is no sin or evil
you can do that will separate you from Christ. Not even God can do this because
He is immutable and cannot change His perfect decisions. The Baptism of the
Spirit is the unifying factor in the Body of Christ. We have equal privilege
and opportunity to execute God's plan for our lives. See category on <a
href="#_D-Baptism_of_the_1">Baptism of the Holy Spirit</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Indwelling of God the Holy Spirit</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>From the moment of salvation onward, God the Holy Spirit
permanently indwells the body of every Church Age believer. The Holy Spirit
indwells the body of every Church Age believer to make their bodies a suitable
temple for the indwelling of deity of Jesus Christ as the Shekinah Glory and a
permanent residence for the indwelling of God the Father. The Holy Spirit also
indwells the body of every Church Age believer to provide a base of operation
for the use of His omnipotence to empower the believer’s spiritual life via the
filling of the Holy Spirit. The believer can then grow spiritually and execute
the plan of God in the spiritual life. John 7:39; Rom. 5:5; Rom. 8:9; Rom. 8:11;
John 14:17; 1 Cor. 3:16; 1 Cor. 6:19-20; Gal. 3:2; Gal. 4:6; 1 John 3:24; 1 Cor.
2:12; 2 Cor. 1:21; 2 Cor. 6:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But this He spoke of the Spirit, whom those who believed in
Him were to receive; for the Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not
yet glorified.” (John 7:39, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“However, you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed
the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if anyone does not have the Spirit of
Christ, he does not belong to Him.” (Romans 8:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“that is the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive,
because it does not see Him or know Him, but you know Him because He abides
with you and will be in you.” (John 14:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy
Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and that you are not your own?
For you have been bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body.” (1
Corinthians 6:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The one who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in
him. We know by this that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He has given us.”
(1 John 3:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Or what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For we are
the temple of the living God; just as God said, &quot;I WILL DWELL IN THEM AND
WALK AMONG THEM; AND I WILL BE THEIR GOD, AND THEY SHALL BE MY PEOPLE.” (2
Corinthians 6:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Sealing Ministry of the Holy Spirit</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every believer is baptized by the Spirit and sealed by
the Spirit. Every Church Age believer is going to be at the Rapture of the
Church and will receive his or her resurrection body. The sealing work of the
Holy Spirit is the basis of our eternal security and occurs at the moment of
salvation. Eph. 4:30; Eph. 1:13; 2 Cor. 1:22; 2 Tim. 2:19. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were
sealed for the day of redemption.&quot;  (Ephesians 4:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;In Him, you also, after listening to the message of
truth, the gospel of your salvation—having also believed, you were sealed in
Him with the Holy Spirit of promise,&quot;  (Ephesians 1:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“who also sealed us and gave us the Spirit in our hearts as a
pledge.” (2 Corinthians 1:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Nevertheless, the firm foundation of God stands, having this
seal, &quot;The Lord knows those who are His,&quot; and, &quot;Everyone who
names the name of the Lord is to abstain from wickedness.&quot;” (2 Timothy
2:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sealing is God the Holy Spirit’s guarantee of the
believer’s eternal life at the point of salvation. When God the Father imputes
eternal life to the believer’s newly created human spirit, God the Holy Spirit
seals that eternal life. There is nothing you can do or God can do to break
this seal. We are in the plan of God. We belong to God. The Holy Spirit
ratifies the New Covenant of salvation. The Holy Spirit is the guarantee of our
eternal security.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Given Spiritual Gifts </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Holy Spirit is the sovereign executive who
distributes spiritual gift(s) to every believer at the point of salvation. He
gives the type of spiritual gift(s) to each individual believer at the moment
of salvation as He desires sovereignly. That was true of all temporary
spiritual gifts from 30 to 96 A.D. and is true of all permanent gifts given
throughout the Church Age. 1 Cor. 12:11; Heb. 2:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But one and the same Spirit works all these things,
distributing to each one individually just as He wills.&quot;  (1 Corinthians
12:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;God also testifying with them, both by signs and wonders
and by various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit according to His own
will.&quot;  (Hebrews 2:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Prior to the Day of Pentecost, the deity of Jesus Christ
distributed spiritual gifts to the believers during His ministry on earth.
There were no spiritual gifts distributed in prior dispensations. Spiritual
gifts given by the Holy Spirit are the work of God for each of us according to
His plan. The distribution of spiritual gifts is the basis for administration
and service within the Body of Christ. Spiritual gifts become automatically
operational as the believer matures spiritually. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>31. We are Glorified</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At salvation, every believer is placed into union with Jesus
Christ by the Holy Spirit (Baptism of the Spirit). Positionally, we are
glorified in Christ. Rom. 8:30.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and these whom He predestined, He also called; and these whom
He called, He also justified; and these whom He justified, He also glorified.”
(Romans 8:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>32. We are Complete in Christ</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer is complete in Christ. We are complete in
Him who is over all angelic rule and authority. Positionally, we are higher
than the angels. Col. 2:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and in Him you have been made complete, and He is the head
over all rule and authority;” (Colossians 2:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>33. We Possess Every Spiritual Blessing</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the moment we accept Christ as Savior, we become the possessor
of spiritual blessings granted by God the Father in eternity past. By growing spiritually,
we receive our blessings in this life. At the Judgment Seat of Christ, we will
receive our eternal blessings from the Lord Jesus Christ. All Church Age
believers have equal privilege and equal opportunity to grow spiritually and thereby
receive these blessings. Eph. 1:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ,”
(Ephesians 1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>34. We Receive a Human Spirit</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Holy Spirit, in His salvation ministry, creates a
human spirit for each believer and imputes or provides it to them as part of
His regeneration ministry. This is so that you have the spiritual apparatus –
the grace apparatus for perception necessary for the intake of the Word of God.
This is called Regeneration. 1 Cor. 2:12; Titus 3:5; 1 Peter 1:23; Rom. 8:16; 1
Thess. 5:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the
Spirit who is from God, so that we may know the things freely given to us by
God,” (1 Corinthians 2:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done
in righteousness, but according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration
and renewing by the Holy Spirit,&quot;  (Titus 3:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;for you have been born again not of seed which is
perishable but imperishable, that is, through the living and enduring word of
God.&quot;  (1 Peter 1:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are
children of God,” (Romans 8:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i><span style='color:blue'>“Now may the God of peace
Himself sanctify you entirely; and may your spirit and soul and body be
preserved complete, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.” (1
Thessalonians 5:23, NASB)</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Regeneration is the technical term for being “born
again.” Being born again is a result of faith in Jesus Christ, occurring at the
instant you personally believe in Jesus Christ. The moment God the Holy Spirit
creates a human spirit, God the Father imputes eternal life to that human
spirit. The unbeliever has no human spirit and is called a “natural” man. 1 Cor.

<p class=Verses>&quot;But a natural man does not accept the things of the
Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them,
because they are spiritually appraised.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 2:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that
which is born of the Spirit is spirit. &quot;Do not be amazed that I said to
you, 'You must be born again.' &quot;  (John 3:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>35. Our Pre-Salvation Sins are Forgiven</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the moment of salvation, the believer is granted total
forgiveness by God the Father of all pre-salvation sins and transgressions. All
unbelievers accumulate scar tissue of the soul. Scar tissue of the soul hinders
any form of happiness, peace, or blessing. At the moment we believe in Christ,
all scar tissue is removed. Through sin and carnality (out of fellowship and
soul controlled by the old sin nature) and involvement in Satan’s world system
of evil, the believer can again accumulate scar tissue on the soul instead of
growing spiritually. Isaiah 43:25; Isaiah 44:22; Eph. 1:7; Col. 1:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I, even I, am the one who wipes out your transgressions
for My own sake, And I will not remember your sins.” (Isaiah 43:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I have wiped out your transgressions like a thick cloud
And your sins like a heavy mist. Return to Me, for I have redeemed you.&quot;”
(Isaiah 44:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness
of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace” (Ephesians 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.”
(Colossians 1:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>36. The Holy Spirit Acts as the Agent of Regeneration </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Holy Spirit is the agent of Regeneration and acts in
a two-step process whenever the Gospel is presented to an unbeliever. Salvation
is all about God's grace. Since the unbeliever is spiritually dead and cannot
understand spiritual things, God the Holy Spirit makes the Gospel clear and
understandable to them. If the unbeliever expresses their free will to choose
for Jesus Christ as Savior, the Holy Spirit takes their positive faith belief
in Christ and carries that faith to the point of salvation. Without the
ministry of God the Holy Spirit at salvation, none of us would have eternal
salvation. John 10:27-28; Eph. 1:13-14; Eph. 2:8-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they
follow Me; and I give eternal life to them, and they will never perish; and no
one will snatch them out of My hand. &quot;  (John 10:27-28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;In Him, you also, after listening to the message of
truth, the gospel of your salvation—having also believed, you were sealed in
Him with the Holy Spirit of promise, who is given as a pledge of our
inheritance, with a view to the redemption of God's own possession, to the
praise of His glory.&quot;  (Ephesians 1:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that
not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no
one may boast.&quot;  (Ephesians 2:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are born‑again as children of God and entered into
God's family at the moment of salvation. God the Holy Spirit in grace acts as
the agent of this new birth. God the Holy Spirit makes your faith effective for
salvation and then seals it. See category on <a href="#_Regeneration">Regeneration</a>.
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>37. We are Guaranteed a Resurrection Body</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the moment of faith belief in the work of Jesus Christ
for your sins, the believer is guaranteed a perfect resurrection body forever. John
11:25; 1 Cor. 15:42-44; 1 Cor. 15:53-55<span style='color:#0432FF'>.</span></p>

<p class=Verses>“Jesus said to her, &quot;I am the resurrection and the life;
he who believes in Me will live even if he dies,” (John 11:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown a
perishable body, it is raised an imperishable body; it is sown in dishonor, it
is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; it is sown a
natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there
is also a spiritual body.” (1 Corinthians 15:42-44, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“For this perishable must put on the imperishable, and this
mortal must put on immortality. But when this perishable will have put on the
imperishable, and this mortal will have put on immortality, then will come
about the saying that is written, &quot;DEATH IS SWALLOWED UP in victory.
&quot;O DEATH, WHERE IS YOUR VICTORY? O DEATH, WHERE IS YOUR STING?&quot;” (1
Corinthians 15:53-55, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>38. We are the Beneficiaries of Unlimited Atonement </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer is the beneficiary of unlimited atonement. Unlimited
atonement means that Jesus Christ was judged on the Cross for all personal sins
of all members of the human race, past present and future. Sins are no longer
an issue with God because they have all been judged. Therefore, salvation is
open to anyone who believes in Christ. Only believers in Jesus Christ are the
beneficiaries of unlimited atonement. 2 Cor. 5:14-15; 2 Cor. 5:19; 1 Tim. 2:6;
1 Tim. 4:10; Titus 2:11; Heb. 2:9; 1 John 2:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the love of Christ controls us, having concluded this,
that one died for all, therefore all died; and He died for all, so that they
who live might no longer live for themselves, but for Him who died and rose
again on their behalf.” (2 Corinthians 5:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“namely, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to
Himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and He has committed to us
the word of reconciliation.” (2 Corinthians 5:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“who gave Himself as a ransom for all, the testimony given at
the proper time.” (1 Timothy 2:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For it is for this we labor and strive, because we have fixed
our hope on the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of
believers.” (1 Timothy 4:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all
men,” (Titus 2:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But we do see Him who was made for a little while lower than
the angels, namely, Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory
and honor, so that by the grace of God He might taste death for everyone.”
(Hebrews 2:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins; and not for
ours only, but also for those of the whole world.” (1 John 2:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>39. We Have Equal Privilege and Opportunity Under
Election and Predestination </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer has equal privilege and equal opportunity
under election and predestination. Only one thing causes true equality in life
for all people involved and that is what God does for each believer at the
moment of faith belief in the Lord Jesus Christ. Every Church Age believer is given
equal privilege and equal opportunity at the moment of salvation. The sovereign
will of God provides election and predestination for the Church Age believer. The
believer is elected to privilege in the royal priesthood and provided equal
opportunity to use God's grace resources to live and grow spiritually and thus
fulfill God's plan for their lives. Rom. 12:3; Eph. 3:16-19; Eph. 1:4-5. See
categories on <a href="#_Election">Election </a>and <a href="#_Predestination">Predestination</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For through the grace given to me I say to everyone among you
not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think; but to think so as
to have sound judgment, as God has allotted to each a measure of faith.”
(Romans 12:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory,
to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inner man, so that
Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; and that you, being rooted and
grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the
breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ which
surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God.”
(Ephesians 3:16-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world,
that we would be holy and blameless before Him. In love He predestined us to
adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind
intention of His will,” (Ephesians 1:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>40. We are Filled With the Holy Spirit</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The filling of the Holy Spirit is the single revocable
absolute given by God at salvation. The believer is filled with the Holy Spirit
at the moment of salvation. The filling of the Holy Spirit received at
salvation is revoked when the believer choses to sin. The filling of the Holy
Spirit is recovered when the believer choses to confess or name their known
sins to God the Father using 1 John 1:9. </p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first time the believer sins, whether they are aware
it the sin or not, the soul instantaneously is controlled by the old sin nature
and the Holy Spirit no longer controls the soul. The believer is now in a state
of carnality. The believer is either 100% carnal of 100% spiritual. There is no
gray area here as God cannot be in the presence of sin. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The only way to recover the filling of the Holy Spirit is
by confessing or naming known sins to God the Father in prayer per 1 John 1:9.
God then removes all unrighteousness (unknown or forgotten sins) and restores
the believer’s soul to the filling of the Holy Spirit. Now the believer is in a
state of spirituality and can learn spiritual things, Bible doctrine, and apply
them to the situations and decisions in life. Gal. 3:3. See categories on the <a
href="#_D-Filling_of_the_1">Filling of the Holy Spirit</a>, <a
href="#_Carnality">Carnality </a>and <a href="#_Spirituality_2">Spirituality</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now
being perfected by the flesh?” (Galatians 3:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Summary</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Do you know for certain that these “40 Things” are yours?
Have you received Jesus Christ as your personal Savior? If you have, they
comprise your eternal relationship with God! You receive these “40 Things” at
the moment of salvation through faith in Christ. At the moment we believe in
Christ, God the Holy Spirit fills or controls our soul. At that moment, the
believer is free from any type of sin. All previous sins committed before
salvation are blotted out. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If you have not yet received Jesus Christ as your
personal Savior, then the issue for you is to “believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
and thou shalt be saved!” Salvation is a grace gift from God. Non-meritorious
faith in the work of Jesus Christ on the Cross is the only requirement to be
saved for eternity. Acts 16:31; Eph. 2:8-9. </p>

<p class=Verses>“They said, &quot;Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be
saved, you and your household.&quot;” (Acts 16:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not
of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one
may boast.” (Ephesians 2:8-9, NASB)</p>
