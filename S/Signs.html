<h2>Signs</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A sign is a phenomenon which must involve a supernatural
factor to be valid. A sign was a miraculous deed from heaven to prove that
Jesus Christ is really God and the Messiah.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>True Signs </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Seven Great Signs to Israel</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There were seven great signs to Israel, but thousands of
signs altogether. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Tongues. Isaiah 28:11; 1 Cor. 14:22. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Indeed, He will speak to this people Through stammering lips
and a foreign tongue,” (Isaiah 28:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So then tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe but
to unbelievers; but prophecy is for a sign, not to unbelievers but to those who
believe.” (1 Corinthians 14:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Virgin Birth. Isaiah 7:14. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold,
a virgin will be with child and bear a son, and she will call His name
Immanuel.” (Isaiah 7:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Sabbath. Exodus 31:13-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But as for you, speak to the sons of Israel, saying,
'You shall surely observe My sabbaths; for this is a sign between Me and you
throughout your generations, that you may know that I am the LORD who
sanctifies you. 'Therefore you are to observe the sabbath, for it is holy to
you. Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death; for whoever does
any work on it, that person shall be cut off from among his people. 'For six
days work may be done, but on the seventh day there is a sabbath of complete rest,
holy to the LORD; whoever does any work on the sabbath day shall surely be put
to death. 'So the sons of Israel shall observe the sabbath, to celebrate the
sabbath throughout their generations as a perpetual covenant.' &quot;It is a
sign between Me and the sons of Israel forever; for in six days the LORD made
heaven and earth, but on the seventh day He ceased from labor, and was
refreshed.&quot;” (Exodus 31:13-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Circumcision. Rom. 4:11. </p>

<p class=Verses>“and he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the
righteousness of the faith which he had while uncircumcised, so that he might
be the father of all who believe without being circumcised, that righteousness
might be credited to them,” (Romans 4:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Christ’s resurrection. Matt. 12:40-41. </p>

<p class=Verses>“for just as JONAH WAS THREE DAYS AND THREE NIGHTS IN THE BELLY
OF THE SEA MONSTER, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in
the heart of the earth. &quot;The men of Nineveh will stand up with this
generation at the judgment, and will condemn it because they repented at the
preaching of Jonah; and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.” (Matthew
12:40-41, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Christ’s substitutionary spiritual death for the sins of
mankind followed by His physical death on the Cross. Isaiah 53:8-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“By oppression and judgment He was taken away; And as for His
generation, who considered That He was cut off out of the land of the living
For the transgression of my people, to whom the stroke was due? His grave was
assigned with wicked men, Yet He was with a rich man in His death, Because He
had done no violence, Nor was there any deceit in His mouth.” (Isaiah 53:8-9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Forty years of miraculous signs in Israel. The entire
book of Acts.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Sign of the Second Advent</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The sign of the Second Advent of Jesus Christ will be in
five phases or will have five characteristics. The first characteristic will be
lightning. Lightning signifies speed. Christ will return with speed. Matt.
24:27.  Lightning can be seen. Rev. 1:7. Lightning is a warning of a storm.
Rev. 14. Lightning disturbs and frightens people. Rev. 6:15-17. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For just as the lightning comes from the east and
flashes even to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be.” (Matthew
24:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“BEHOLD, HE IS COMING WITH THE CLOUDS, and every eye will see
Him, even those who pierced Him; and all the tribes of the earth will mourn
over Him. So it is to be. Amen.” (Revelation 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the kings of the earth and the great men and the
commanders and the rich and the strong and every slave and free man hid
themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains; and they said to
the mountains and to the rocks, &quot;Fall on us and hide us from the presence
of Him who sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb; for the great
day of their wrath has come, and who is able to stand?&quot;” (Revelation
6:15-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The second characteristic will be the great slaughter in
the Armageddon Campaign. Matt. 24:28. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will gather.”
(Matthew 24:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The third characteristic will be celestial disturbances.
Matt. 24:29. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But immediately after the tribulation of those days THE
SUN WILL BE DARKENED, AND THE MOON WILL NOT GIVE ITS LIGHT, AND THE STARS WILL
FALL from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.” (Matthew
24:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fourth characteristic will be the mourning and regathering
of regenerate Israel in the Land. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fifth characteristic will be the resurrection of
regenerate Israel (believers) from Abraham onward. In Isaiah, He commands and
all are brought back into the Land. Matt. 24:31.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET
and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of
the sky to the other.” (Matthew 24:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Significance of the Sign of Jonah</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Word of God is stronger than any sign or miracle. If
you had the chance to either give out the Word or heal someone to manifest the
power of God, which is much stronger? Matt. 16:1-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The Pharisees and Sadducees came up, and testing Jesus, they
asked Him to show them a sign from heaven. But He replied to them, &quot;When
it is evening, you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.'
&quot;And in the morning, 'There will be a storm today, for the sky is red and
threatening.' Do you know how to discern the appearance of the sky, but cannot
discern the signs of the times? &quot;An evil and adulterous generation seeks
after a sign; and a sign will not be given it, except the sign of Jonah.&quot;
And He left them and went away.” (Matthew 16:1-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Miracles are more impressive to some believers than all
the Bible doctrine in the world. The Bible isn’t their criterion. Their
criteria are tongues, healing, signs and miracles. Here, Jesus Christ gives
them Bible doctrine and they won’t take it. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 15:7 and Acts 20:21, the verb “repent” is <span
lang=EL>μετανοε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (metanoeō) and is transitive. It
has to have an object. What is the object of the verb “to repent” in the
Scriptures? The object is God. Usually it is used without an object although
the object is assumed. </p>

<p class=Verses>“solemnly testifying to both Jews and Greeks of repentance
toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.” (Acts 20:21, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I tell you that in the same way, there will be more joy
in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons
who need no repentance.” (Luke 15:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>False Signs </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>People think more of a sign than they do of Jesus Christ.
Satan uses false signs to deceive both unbelievers and believers who have
become negative to Bible doctrine. This will include speaking in tongues and
other false signs during the Tribulation. 2 Thess. 2:3; Matt. 24:24; Rev.
13:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Let no one in any way deceive you, for it will not come unless
the apostasy comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of
destruction,” (2 Thessalonians 2:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will
show great signs and wonders, so as to mislead, if possible, even the elect.”
(Matthew 24:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And he deceives those who dwell on the earth because of the
signs which it was given him to perform in the presence of the beast, telling
those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast who had the wound of
the sword and has come to life.” (Revelation 13:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The regathering of regenerate Israel (Jewish believers)
in the Land will only be significant in the dispensation of the Tribulation. The
Jews require a sign, but the power is in the preaching of the Word of God. 1
Cor. 1:22; Matt. 16:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For indeed Jews ask for signs and Greeks search for wisdom;”
(1 Corinthians 1:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign;
and a sign will not be given it, except the sign of Jonah.&quot; And He left
them and went away.” (Matthew 16:4, NASB)</p>
