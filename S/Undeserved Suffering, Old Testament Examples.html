<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Ezra’s Father in the Death March from Ramah to Babylon</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is a study of what happens to young people during
and after an invasion, in the destruction of cities, and how Bible doctrine
makes the difference. It is based on the death march from Ramah to Babylon
after the complete destruction of Jerusalem in August of 586 BC by the army of
King Nebuchadnezzar. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/A/Maximum%20Adversity%2C%20Believer%E2%80%99s%20Triumph.html">Maximum
Adversity, The Believer’s Triumph</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Prophets</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In James 5:10, “As an example, brethren” is <span
lang=EL>υ</span>̔<span lang=EL>πο</span>́<span lang=EL>δειγμα</span>
(hupodeigma) in the Greek and means an exhibit for imitation or warning or an
example. This was a growing believer receiving an example. By application, it
means “Receive an example, members of the family of God.”</p>

<p class=Verses>“As an example, brethren, of suffering and patience, take the
prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.”  (James 5:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Suffering” is <span lang=EL>κακοπα</span>́<span lang=EL>θεια</span>
(kakopatheia) and refers to undeserved suffering. It means to endure affliction
in fellowship when all manner of evil things are thrown your way. “And
patience” is <span lang=EL>μακροθυμι</span>́<span lang=EL>α</span>
(makrothumia) and means long suffering. It is staying in fellowship under
pressure. This is the growing or mature believer able to withstand undeserved
suffering while staying filled with the Holy Spirit and relying on God's grace
resources including the <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the right lobe of
their soul. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In James 5:10, “take the prophets” is the term used for
the gift of communication in the Old Testament and is comparable to the gift of
pastor-teacher in the Church Age. “Who spoke in the name of the Lord” is the
aorist active indicative of <span lang=EL>λαλε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(laleō) and means to communicate Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A corrected translation of James 5:10 is; “Members of the
family of God, take as an example of endurance in suffering and patience, the
prophets who have communicated doctrine in the name of the Lord.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The prophets of the Old Testament used Bible doctrine
which was the coin of the realm for the spiritual life. In spiritual maturity,
they had a capacity for freedom, life, love, happiness of God, grace, and
prosperity. They used it in time of adversity, tragedy, and adversity. Both
Elijah and Job started as spiritually maturity believers, both went into
reversionism and both of them recovered. They are perfect illustrations! They
knew undeserved and deserved suffering.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Job</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The testing of Job is an example of undeserved suffering
to prove to Satan that an inferior creature with volition can stay positive to
the love of God even through intense undeserved suffering.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In James 5:11, “We count those blessed” is the present
active indicative of <span lang=EL>μακαρι</span>́<span lang=EL>ζω</span>
(makarizō) and means to congratulate because they have achieved or done
something worthy of recognition or worthy of happiness. This is like
congratulating a bridegroom. It means to recognize their happiness. This
applies to any spiritually mature believer who has doctrine in their soul for
all kinds of pressure situations. It means to recognize those believers who are
saturated with Bible doctrine and have inner happiness in prosperity and in
adversity.</p>

<p class=Verses>“We count those blessed who endured. You have heard of the
endurance of Job and have seen the outcome of the Lord’s dealings, that the
Lord is full of compassion and is merciful.”  (James 5:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Job had three friends who failed miserably. Job had spiritual
maturity and had everything in terms of material wealth. When adversity came,
he lost everything and his wife became a nag. When all of those things hit,
Job’s three reversionistic friends should have come by and congratulated Job
for handling his undeserved adversity! Had they done this, the Book of Job
would be only four chapters long. Instead, Job prayed for his friends. At that
time, Job was applying Bible doctrine and had reliance on the plan of God
regardless of his situation. Job 1:21; Job 13:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He said, “Naked I came from my mother’s womb, And naked I
shall return there. The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away. Blessed be the
name of the LORD.”“  (Job 1:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““Though He slay me, I will hope in Him. Nevertheless I will
argue my ways before Him.”  (Job 13:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>His negative wife had some rather contrary things to say
to Job in Job 2:9-10, but he kept his cool, his integrity and stayed in
fellowship with God. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then his wife said to him, “Do you still hold fast your
integrity? Curse God and die!” But he said to her, “You speak as one of the
foolish women speaks. Shall we indeed accept good from God and not accept
adversity?” In all this Job did not sin with his lips.”  (Job 2:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In James 5:11, “who endured” is the aorist active
participle of <span lang=EL>ὑπομονή</span> (hupomonē) and refers to those
who stayed in fellowship and continued to apply Bible doctrine when undeserved
suffering came. “You have heard” is the aorist active indicative of <span
lang=EL>ἀκούω</span> (akouō). The Jews had been taught and understood the
Old Testament Scriptures.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Endurance of Job” is <span lang=EL>ὑπομονή</span>
(hupomonē) and means steadfastness, constancy, endurance. Job stayed in
fellowship with God. He continued to apply Bible doctrine to the extreme
testing situation! When the terrible news came in, he focused on God's promises
and continued to trust in God's Word even in catastrophe. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In James 5:11, “and have seen” is the aorist active
indicative of <span lang=EL>ὁράω</span> (horaō). This skips over his
reversionism, because that would anticipate what was coming up. The aorist
tense means the point when they studied Job under some teacher. The active
voice means they sat and listened to the teaching of Job and understood it. The
indicative mood means the reality of the fact that when they did it, they were
understanding the issue of Job and moving toward spiritual maturity. “The
outcome of the Lord’s dealings” is <span lang=EL>τέλος</span> (telos) and
refers to the end of the story of Job under suffering.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Job lost his livelihood, his children, and his health
during this intense testing. Job passed these tests. However, he failed the
testing initially that involved his three close friends. In a series of
speeches in Job 3 through Job 14, Job’s speech was followed by those of his
three friends, each in turn answered by Job.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Job 15 through Job 21, each of the friends spoke to
Job and was answered by him. In Job 22 through Job 31, Eliphaz and Bildad speak
until answered by Job. They imply that Job deserved all of this and that, in
some way, he had stepped out of line badly with God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Job answered them and said he was under undeserved
suffering and that there was something that his friends did not understand. Job
then went on to review doctrines relating to the perfect essence of God, the
promise of resurrection, judgment, etc. Job’s point was that God has designed a
plan for each believer with grace provision to withstand and grow spiritually
from all deserved and undeserved suffering. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Job prayed for his reversionistic friends, just as the
pastor-teacher is to pray for a reversionistic flock. Just as Elijah prayed for
a reversionistic nation. Job phased out doctrine and listened to his idiot
friends. Then, when he got straightened out, God told the three idiot friends
to call on Job and he would pray for them and the captivity of them all would
be turned. Then God poured out His very own happiness on Job and it was
fantastic. “That the Lord is full of compassion and is merciful.” Even with spiritually
mature believers, the emphasis is still always on the Lord. See category on <a
