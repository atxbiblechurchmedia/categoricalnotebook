<h2>Suicide </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ was judged on the Cross for all of the sins
of all mankind. This is called Unlimited Atonement. Therefore, He paid the
penalty for the sin of suicide. He bore all sins, paying the penalty for
everyone. This does not mean that everyone is automatically saved. 1 John 2:2;
Isaiah 53. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/A/Atonement%2C%20Unlimited.html">Atonement, Unlimited</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins; and not for
ours only, but also for those of the whole world.” (1 John 2:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“All of us like sheep have gone astray, Each of us has turned
to his own way; But the LORD has caused the iniquity of us all To fall on Him.
He was oppressed and He was afflicted, Yet He did not open His mouth; Like a
lamb that is led to slaughter, And like a sheep that is silent before its
shearers, So He did not open His mouth.” (Isaiah 53:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Saul was a believer and died of suicide. Saul went to
heaven after he died. 1 Sam. 31:1-6; 1 Sam. 10 and 11; 1 Sam. 28:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now the Philistines were fighting against Israel, and the men
of Israel fled from before the Philistines and fell slain on Mount Gilboa. The
Philistines overtook Saul and his sons; and the Philistines killed Jonathan and
Abinadab and Malchi-shua the sons of Saul. The battle went heavily against
Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was badly wounded by the archers. Then
Saul said to his armor bearer, &quot;Draw your sword and pierce me through with
it, otherwise these uncircumcised will come and pierce me through and make
sport of me.&quot; But his armor bearer would not, for he was greatly afraid.
So Saul took his sword and fell on it. When his armor bearer saw that Saul was
dead, he also fell on his sword and died with him. Thus Saul died with his
three sons, his armor bearer, and all his men on that day together.” (1 Samuel
31:1-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Moreover the LORD will also give over Israel along with
you into the hands of the Philistines, therefore tomorrow you and your sons
will be with me. Indeed the LORD will give over the army of Israel into the
hands of the Philistines!&quot;” (1 Samuel 28:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A believer cannot lose their salvation or be separated
from the love of God for any reason. Romans 8:38 says that “death” can’t
separate the believer from the Lord and it includes suicide. Rom. 8:35-39. See
category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/E/Eternal%20Security.html">Eternal Security</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will
tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or
sword? Just as it is written, &quot;FOR YOUR SAKE WE ARE BEING PUT TO DEATH ALL
DAY LONG; WE WERE CONSIDERED AS SHEEP TO BE SLAUGHTERED.&quot; But in all these
things we overwhelmingly conquer through Him who loved us. For I am convinced
that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things
present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other created
thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ
Jesus our Lord.” (Romans 8:35-39, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A believer may be out of fellowship when they die, but never
out of our relationship with Jesus Christ. See category on the <a
href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/B/Baptism%20of%20the%20Holy%20Spirit.html">Baptism of the Holy Spirit</a>.  See category on <a
href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/P/Positional%20Truth.html">Positional Truth</a>. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A believer or an unbeliever commits suicide when scar
tissue has completely closed up their soul and feel that there is nothing left
to live for. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/J/Judas%20Iscariot.html">Judas Iscariot</a>. See
category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/S/Scar%20Tissue%20of%20the%20Soul.html">Scar Tissue of the Soul</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A misunderstanding of some major doctrines (stemming from
positional truth) causes many believers to be off in their understanding of
suicide. Yes, suicide is tragic, but it does not cause a loss of salvation.</p>
