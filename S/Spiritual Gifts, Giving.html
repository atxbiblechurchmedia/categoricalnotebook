<h2>Spiritual Gifts, Giving</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The spiritual gift of giving appears to be conveyed to
relatively few believers in the Church Age. This gift is not synonymous with
every believer's responsibility to give as unto the Lord as we are worshiping
the Lord in the confines of the worship service. Each one of us is to give
something from our finances based on whatever we are able to give as God has
prospered us.  This is for all believers. Giving is to be an expression of our
love for the Lord and a commemoration of God's grace. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This spiritual gift of giving is giving with liberality,
which means above and beyond normal giving. Those with this spiritual gift love
to give of their finances to the work of the Lord. They do it above and beyond what
the universal priesthood is able to do. Rom. 12:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;or he who exhorts, in his exhortation; he who gives, with
liberality; he who leads, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with
cheerfulness.&quot;  (Romans 12:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 12:8, the word “gives” is <span lang=EL>μεταδι</span>́<span
lang=EL>δωμι</span> (metadidōmi) in the Greek indicates prosperity in material
wealth coupled with a grace mental attitude toward believers. The word
“liberality” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̔<span lang=EL>πλο</span>́<span lang=EL>της</span>
(haplotēs) and means singleness, simplicity, sincerity, mental honesty, one
who is free from pretense and hypocrisy. Grace is always sensitive to the lack
of others. The believer with this spiritual gift is able to supply their wants
biblically with no fuss or fanfare and to give with no strings attached. They
give without emphasis on merit and not as a loaning ministry.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is a spiritual gift given to both rich and poor for
the “liberal” giving of their earthly possessions in providing for the needs of
the local church, to missions, to those who are financially helpless, and to
individual believers. The Bible does not teach that you must give all your
money through or to the local church. Giving to any people in need, even though
not by means of the local church, it still true giving. You have a right to
give your money directly to any number of organizations or people in need and
it is legitimate Christian giving.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some people recognize the needs of others and dig deeper
of their own volition. They do not do so through coercion or begging as some
churches have been known to do. Some churches send bills if your tithe has not
been received! This is wrong! This is not giving as unto the Lord based on the
Word of God resident in your soul! Spiritual giving in both the Old and New
Testaments has never had any percentage attached to it. Tithing commanded in
the Old Testament was taxation to support the government of the Nation of
Israel just as we are to pay our taxes in the United States as required by law.
See category on <a href="#_Tithing">Tithing</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some people with the spiritual gift of giving are
thrilled to exercise their gift when someone is in need. They give over and
above their regular giving under their priesthood. God graces out a few people
with the spiritual gift of giving, making it possible for them to give sacrificially.
Spiritual giving is first of all a mental attitude. You can give even though
impoverished. You can still have the mental attitude of a giver even if you’re
not able to give because of the superseding mandate from the Scripture which is
to provide first for your family. Before you give to the local church, you have
a responsibility to provide for your family! If a person has the spiritual gift
of giving and he has a family, he is limited in how he can use his spiritual gift.
2 Cor. 9:7; 1 Tim. 5:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Each one must do just as he has purposed in his heart,
not grudgingly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.&quot;  (2
Corinthians 9:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But if anyone does not provide for his own, and
especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse
than an unbeliever.&quot;  (1 Timothy 5:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A person with the spiritual gift of giving will give
sacrificially whether rich or poor. If they have this gift, they will give
sacrificially. As with most of the spiritual gifts, the gift you have been
given at salvation will begin functioning once you reach a certain level of
spiritual maturity even though you may not know you have the gift. You simply
have to grow in grace and knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ and it will
function automatically.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Giving sacrificially poses no problem for those who are
single, wealthy, or have already provided for their family. If you have this
gift, God will provide for the poor and for the rich to give sacrificially.
Keep in mind that this is a spiritual gift provided to relatively few. If you
do not have this gift, then God only requires that you have the mental attitude
of a desire to give whether you are able to give or not. This is the grace
attitude of true giving.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The spiritual gift of giving involves finances given to
believers who are in dire straits. In Romans 12:13, the spiritual gift of
giving is described by the word “contributing” and is the present active
participle of <span lang=EL>κοινωνε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (koinōneō)
and means to minister with money, to meet needs among believers. The word
“needs” is <span lang=EL>χρει</span>́<span lang=EL>α</span> (chreia) in the
plural. It is the necessity to eat, drink, and wear clothing. The spiritual
gift of giving has to do with believers only in a local church. The direction
of the giving is believers. It is a very valuable spiritual gift during severe
persecution. Job 5:20. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;contributing to the needs of the saints, practicing
hospitality.&quot;  (Romans 12:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;In famine He will redeem you from death, And in war
from the power of the sword.&quot;  (Job 5:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The spiritual gift of giving is designed to operate when
the Angelic Conflict gets very intensified during times of war, famine,
pestilence, or extreme deprivation. A believer with the spiritual gift of
giving would motivate this type of offering. Acts 20:34; Phil. 4:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;You yourselves know that these hands ministered to
my own needs and to the men who were with me.&quot;  (Acts 20:34, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;for even in Thessalonica you sent a gift more than once
for my needs.&quot;  (Philippians 4:16, NASB)</p>
