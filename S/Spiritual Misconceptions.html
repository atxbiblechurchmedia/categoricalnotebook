<h2>Spiritual Misconceptions </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Misconception No. 1: There is no such thing as
absolute or eternal truth. </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is the false assumption that everything is relative,
that everything changes, and therefore to hold convictions about anything is to
be narrow-minded. To stand for principle is to be bigoted. People demand that
both sides of everything be taught, without indicating right or wrong, good or
bad, moral or immoral. This opens the door to Communism and Socialism which are
closely related. The rejection of absolute truth is replaced by “scientific
determinism” coupled with subjectivity. The solution to Misconception No. 1 is
in Malachi 3:6 and John 14:6. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For I, the LORD, do not change; therefore you, O sons of
Jacob, are not consumed.” (Malachi 3:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Jesus said to him, &quot;I am the way, and the truth, and the
life; no one comes to the Father but through Me.” (John 14:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Misconception No. 2: Materialistic change is progress.
</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is the false assumption that all the changes we have
had in this country such as the electronic advances, the sophistication of
military technology, medical advancements, wonder drugs, etc. are beneficial
overt changes. However, they are superficial at best because they do not
include inner change and improvement. People often says, “Isn’t it wonderful
that we have accomplished this or that.” But material progress does not change
the soul of man nor keep him from emotional revolt. Only Bible doctrine is
beneficial to the inner man. The solution to Misconception No. 2 is in 1 John
2:17. </p>

<p class=Verses>“The world is passing away, and also its lusts; but the one who
does the will of God lives forever.” (1 John 2:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Misconception No. 3: Physical survival is the highest
goal in life. </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some say that there is nothing worth dying for. That it
is better to be red than dead. Or live by a philosophy that it is better to
coexist than not exist. These are surrender concepts in the minds of many
people today. We no longer hear from men like Patrick Henry, “is life, so dear,
or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains, or slavery.
Forbid it Almighty God. I know not what course others may take, but as for me,
give me liberty or give me death.” You don’t hear that any more, except from
believers who have doctrine. The solution to Misconception No. 3 is in Mark
8:36. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world,
and forfeit his soul?” (Mark 8:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Misconception No. 4: Friendship can be purchased with
money. </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This false concept has helped destroy our economy. The
Marshall Plan was a demonstration of this, and since that time the American
taxpayer’s money has gone into many areas of the world to bolster up Socialistic
regimes where freedom is limited or nonexistent. The solution to Misconception
No. 4 is also in Mark 8:36. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world,
and forfeit his soul?” (Mark 8:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Misconception No. 5: People are born equal. </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is a long-standing misconception. However, the man
Jefferson did not say that people were born equal, but that citizens were born
equal. Thomas Jefferson did not believe in the equality of men. What he meant was
that people have the right to be born free in a national entity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Obviously people don’t have equality of mentality when
born nor equality of physical life. Some are born handicapped. Man has been
given free will (volition) by the sovereignty of God and this country has had
the principles which protect man’s freedom. People are free to marry, to pursue
a vocation, to accept or reject Jesus Christ, to worship in the church of their
choosing and so on. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One of the side effects of this misconception that people
are born equal is to reduce everyone to the lowest level. For example, this
delusion says that to be selective about friends is to be non-democratic. Since
every man is equal and you have a business, one man will be as good a worker as
any other. Thus, as a business owner under this principle, you are forced to
hire help, which will ultimately bankrupt you.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This attempt to make everybody equal pulls people’s
individuality apart as well as their personality. It destroys initiative and
free enterprise and finally robs a nation of its vigor. The only true basis of
equality in homo sapiens is not Socialism, but Regeneration. Christianity puts
every believer on the highest plane possible, a permanent position in Christ.
This misconception that people are born equal puts everyone on the lowest level
possible of not being able to think.  The solution to Misconception No. 5 is in
John 8:32. </p>

<p class=Verses>“and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you
free.&quot;” (John 8:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Misconception No. 6: The majority is always right. </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The majority rule is a technique to make decisions, no
more, no less. It may be the right decision, but it may be wrong. A mob may be
a majority in an area, but a mob never would make a right decision. Let’s say
that many legislators in the USA believe that registering weapons, or relieving
people of their weapons is a deterrent to crime. Does that make it right? No! The
solution to Misconception No. 6 is in Titus 3:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“This is a trustworthy statement; and concerning these things I
want you to speak confidently, so that those who have believed God will be
careful to engage in good deeds. These things are good and profitable for men.”
(Titus 3:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Misconception No. 7: Crime can be deterred by gun
legislation. </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As a tradition of the American heritage, Americans have
always owned guns. We have the “right to own and bear arms.” History has taught
that where countries have all guns registered, then when they are invaded
militarily by an aggressive nation, they can capture the registered guns very
quickly. This happened in Czechoslovakia where a large number of private
citizens had their own weapons. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There have always been those who feel that private
citizens have no business with weapons. Some leaders feel that people should
submit weakly and meekly. Citizens without a means of defense means that if
someone is robbing you, you cannot resist them or neutralize them as a threat,
you can only submit to it and be the weak and meek victim. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Obviously guns are dangerous. They are intended to be so.
They would be useless if they were not dangerous. Of course there are many
other things in life that are dangerous such as cars, knives, sharp objects,
stoves, electric fans, and even surgery.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>People against gun ownership like to quote statistics to
prove that more people are killed with guns than icepicks, but if you remove
the guns and then see how the ratio would look, then they would want to have
everyone register their icepicks. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Yes, criminals do abuse guns, that is why they are
criminals. What effect would gun legislation have on law-breakers? None. They
don’t keep the law anyway. They are law-breakers. It is the law-abiding citizen
that is unarmed, not the criminal.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Still one of the greatest deterrents on crime is a woman
with a sawed off shotgun loaded with Double 00 buckshot facing you across the
room. This has done more to discourage crime than anything else. The solution
to Misconception No. 7 is in Luke 22:35-38.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He said to them, &quot;When I sent you out without money
belt and bag and sandals, you did not lack anything, did you?&quot; They said,
&quot;No, nothing.&quot; And He said to them, &quot;But now, whoever has a
money belt is to take it along, likewise also a bag, and whoever has no sword
is to sell his coat and buy one. &quot;For I tell you that this which is
written must be fulfilled in Me, 'AND HE WAS NUMBERED WITH TRANSGRESSORS'; for
that which refers to Me has its fulfillment.&quot; They said, &quot;Lord, look,
here are two swords.&quot; And He said to them, &quot;It is enough.&quot;”
(Luke 22:35-38, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Misconception No. 8: Warfare can be outlawed by
disarmament. </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Disarming a nation to prevent war is like stopping crime
by abolishing our law enforcement agencies. God armed the Israelites and He
taught them how to make war when necessary. 1 Chron. 5:19-22.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“They made war against the Hagrites, Jetur, Naphish and Nodab.
They were helped against them, and the Hagrites and all who were with them were
given into their hand; for they cried out to God in the battle, and He answered
their prayers because they trusted in Him. They took away their cattle: their
50,000 camels, 250,000 sheep, 2,000 donkeys; and 100,000 men. For many fell
slain, because the war was of God. And they settled in their place until the
exile.” (1 Chronicles 5:19-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The solution to the Misconception No. 8 is in Deuteronomy
20:13. The sword is the equivalent of the gun in protection. It shows they were
armed and fought. Remember that the swords and spears being beaten into
plow-shares and pruning hooks is a Millennial reference. At the present time,
there will be “wars and rumors of wars” until the Second Advent. A strong
military protects a nation. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;When the LORD your God gives it into your hand, you
shall strike all the men in it with the edge of the sword.” (Deuteronomy 20:13,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Misconception No. 9: Internationalism can solve man’s
problems. </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Be sure you understand the four Divine Institutions
thoroughly. God’s order is nationalism. God has ordained nations. The only way
the Angelic Conflict can be solved is through nationalism, never
internationalism. Gen. 9-10. The solution to Misconception No. 9  is in Acts
17:26. </p>

<p class=Verses>“and He made from one man every nation of mankind to live on
all the face of the earth, having determined their appointed times and the
boundaries of their habitation,” (Acts 17:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Misconception No. 10: Improving the environment will
solve man’s problems.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan keeps selling the idea to people that improved
environment is the answer to starving humanity, diseased humanity, deprived
humanity and so on. Improved environment is the devil’s attempt to start the
Millennium before the Second Advent of Jesus Christ when only He establishes
the perfect environment of the Millennium.  The solution to Misconception No.
10 is in Matthew 4:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But He answered and said, &quot;It is written, 'MAN SHALL NOT
LIVE ON BREAD ALONE, BUT ON EVERY WORD THAT PROCEEDS OUT OF THE MOUTH OF
GOD.'&quot;” (Matthew 4:4, NASB)</p>
