<h2><a name="_Spiritual_Growth"></a>Spiritual Growth</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>After one believes in the Lord Jesus Christ and receives
eternal life, they are never to stop believing. They are mandated to “grow in
the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.” To accomplish
this, the day by day walk in the spiritual life must be initiated by faith. 2
Peter 3:18; Heb. 11:6. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and
Savior Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory, both now and to the day of eternity.
Amen.&quot;  (2 Peter 3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he
who comes to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who
seek Him.&quot;  (Hebrews 11:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Minimum
Requirements for Spiritual Growth </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first requirement for spiritual growth is to confirm
that you are in fellowship with God and filled with God the Holy Spirit. This
is absolutely essential for spiritual growth and to learn any Bible doctrine.
To confirm you are in fellowship with God and filled with the Holy Spirit, you
must apply God's promise of confession of sin biblically contained in 1 John
1:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The second requirement for
spiritual growth is to understand your relationship with God and Jesus Christ
as a Church Age believer. You should know the doctrine of Positional Truth -
both Retroactive Positional Truth and Current Positional Truth which give
stability in eternal security. See category on <a href="#_Positional_Truth">Positional
Truth</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The third requirement for spiritual growth is to
understand the only mechanism God has provided for learning Bible doctrine or
the Word of God. This grace mechanism is called the Grace Apparatus for Perception.
See category on the <a href="#_Grace_Apparatus_For">Grace Apparatus for
Perception</a>. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The grace apparatus for perception has the following
stages; </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Stage 1 - the
communication of Bible doctrine from a prepared pastor-teacher, </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Stage 2 -
receptive comprehension of what is being communicated while in fellowship under
the ministry of the Holy Spirit whereby the believer understands the spiritual
information (Bible doctrine) being taught by the pastor-teacher, </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Stage 3 - <span
style='color:black'>faith-perception where God the Holy Spirit converts <i>gnosis</i>
Bible doctrine into <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine and transfers that believed
spiritual knowledge into the right lobe of the soul, </span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span
style='color:black'>Stage 4 - application of <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine to
life’s situations and decisions. <i>Epignosis</i> doctrine is the only divine
viewpoint that can be applied to life, and </span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span
style='color:black'>Stage 5 - spiritual growth in the fulfillment of the plan
of God for the believer’s life. Only <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine results in
spiritual growth and occupation with the person of Christ. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The accumulation of <i>epignosis</i> in the soul’s frame
of reference and application of <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine to life’s
situations and decisions results in the construction of an edification structure
or complex in the right lobe of the soul. See category on <a
href="#_D-The_Edification_Complex">The Edification Complex of the Soul</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>The fourth requirement for
spiritual growth is to understand how to use God's promises, techniques,
doctrines and principles - in that order. See category on <a
href="#_D-The_Faith-Rest_Life">The Faith Rest Life</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Objectives of Spiritual Growth</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The objectives of spiritual growth are to develop
spiritual discernment, to become spiritually self-sustaining, to stop scar
tissue build-up, to develop a consistent intake and application of Bible
doctrine, and to construct an edification complex of the soul from the
accumulated <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Growth in the Christian life does not remain static.
There is progression and retrogression. One of the great objectives in the
Christian life is to get the newly born-again believer to grow spiritually.
Zeal without the filling of the Holy Spirit is unfruitful. Learned Bible
doctrine in the left lobe of the soul (<i>gnosis</i>), but not believed is not
spiritually applicable. Even a mature believer with maximum <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine in their soul who is out of fellowship (in carnality) has no
Bible doctrine that is spiritually applicable because they are not filled with
the Holy Spirit. Their spiritual life in carnality is unfruitful. Rom. 10:2-4;
2 Tim. 3:7. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but
not in accordance with knowledge. For not knowing about God's righteousness and
seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the
righteousness of God. For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to
everyone who believes.” (Romans 10:2-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the
truth.” (2 Timothy 3:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>These two passages refer to <i>gnosis</i> in the mind,
the left lobe of the soul - head knowledge only, but no <i>epignosis</i> in the
right lobe of the soul. Thus, the faith principles are not usable. Bible
doctrine is learned and spiritually understood in the filling of the Holy
Spirit and is transferred to the left lobe of the soul as <i>gnosis</i>. This
is only a staging area for positive volition or belief in that doctrine to
allow the Holy Spirit to convert <i>gnosis</i> into <i>epignosis </i>and to
transfer that <i>epignosis</i> to the right lobe of the soul (heart) for
application in the spiritual life. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Developing Spiritual Discernment</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Discernment is applying <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine
to teaching and finding out if it is true or false. Spiritual discernment means
that the believer is able to review and evaluate what they see, hear, and read
and compare that to the <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in their soul to
determine whether that information is of Satan’s world system of evil or
consistent with the Word of God. The believer is also able to evaluate the
Bible doctrine taught and to correlate it with the Bible doctrine they have already
believed. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This does not mean that the believer is to criticize the
pastor-teacher. Criticism of the person doing the teaching falls into the
category of judgment and is wrong. The principle is that it is not the man, but
the message. This principle applies to both good and bad teaching. 1 John 4:1;
Matt. 7:1-2; 2 John 1:7-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to
see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into
the world.” (1 John 4:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Do not judge so that you will not be judged. &quot;For
in the way you judge, you will be judged; and by your standard of measure, it
will be measured to you.” (Matthew 7:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do
not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. This is the deceiver and
the antichrist. Watch yourselves, that you do not lose what we have
accomplished, but that you may receive a full reward. Anyone who goes too far
and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God; the one who
abides in the teaching, he has both the Father and the Son.” (2 John 1:7-9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All believers are commanded to grow spiritually.
Spiritual stability and discernment come from the application of <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine in the Christian way of life. 1 Peter 2:2; 2 Peter 3:18; Isaiah
33:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“like newborn babies, long for the pure milk of the word, so
that by it you may grow in respect to salvation,” (1 Peter 2:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory, both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.”
(2 Peter 3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He will be the stability of your times, A wealth of
salvation, wisdom and knowledge; The fear of the LORD is his treasure.” (Isaiah
33:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Colossians 1:9-10, Paul prayed that the Colossians
might get more <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine into the right lobe of their
souls. The resultant frame of reference allows the believer in fellowship to
apply Bible doctrine to experience. The pity is that many believers are stuffed
with <i>gnosis</i>, but have never believed what they have learned, thus it has
no spiritual application.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason also, since the day we heard of it, we have
not ceased to pray for you and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge
of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding, so that you will walk in
a manner worthy of the Lord, to please Him in all respects, bearing fruit in
every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God;” (Colossians 1:9-10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The young person has very little true capacity for
enjoying life as God intended it, unless they have gained some <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine in their soul. One of the chief applications of Bible doctrine
will be waiting or having greater patience. We are to wait for the right kind
of man or right kind of woman for marriage. We must gain the discernment to
wait for the right situations to develop. This can only be accomplished by the
building of an edification complex in the right lobe of the soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The young person should cut down on social life and build
up in the spiritual realm because decisions made in the teenage years are
usually decisions of ruin. But at age 21 or maybe a few years older and if they
have taken in Bible doctrine, they will have gained some discernment and can
tell a jerk from a real man or woman. Now they have the capacity for the right
kind of social life. They have a concept of true freedom and some spiritual
discernment. They can gain enough Bible doctrine to carry them along through
difficult times and have some satisfaction in times of prosperity. Teenagers
get into the mad scramble and can’t handle themselves socially. If they get
into the “fast crowd,” they may get into drugs and other illegal activities.
Their parents need the courage to keep their teenagers out of this type of rat
race and be able to openly communicate.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Becoming Spiritually Self-Sustaining</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To be spiritually self-sustaining means the believer has
enough Bible doctrine in their soul to deal with life’s situations and
decisions apart from dependence on others. Their thinking is more and more
divine viewpoint rather than human viewpoint. The believer begins to rely on
what is in their soul over what others advise them to do or think. They look to
the counsel of the Word of God in the right lobe of their soul under the
ministry of God the Holy Spirit rather than the counsel of other people.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Stopping Scar Tissue Build-Up</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All believers are free of scar tissue at the moment of
salvation. Because scar tissue is formed through mental attitude sins and
negative volition to Bible doctrine, the believer’s consistent intake of Bible
doctrine from a pastor-teacher who is prepared and application of that <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine keeps the believer from scar tissue buildup. Isaiah 44:22; Prov.
6:32; 2 Tim. 3; Eph. 4:17-20. See category on <a href="#_Scar_Tissue_of">Scar
Tissue of the Soul</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I have wiped out your transgressions like a thick cloud
And your sins like a heavy mist. Return to Me, for I have redeemed you.&quot;”
(Isaiah 44:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The one who commits adultery with a woman is lacking sense; He
who would destroy himself does it.” (Proverbs 6:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So this I say, and affirm together with the Lord, that you
walk no longer just as the Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their mind,
being darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life of God because of
the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart; and
they, having become callous, have given themselves over to sensuality for the
practice of every kind of impurity with greediness. But you did not learn
Christ in this way,” (Ephesians 4:17-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Developing a Consistent Intake and Application of
Bible Doctrine</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Developing a routine of consistent intake of Bible
doctrine from a prepared pastor-teacher is crucial to spiritual growth. This
must be accompanied by a consistent confession of known sins to God the Father
to be filled with the Holy Spirit and thereby spiritually equipped to learn the
Word of God as taught. Maintaining a state of spirituality a maximum amount of
the time also results in a consistent application of the <i>epignosis</i> Bible
doctrine. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Learning and believing Bible doctrine results in
increasing <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the soul. The believer
learns awareness of Christ and who and what He is in the self-consciousness of
their soul. The believer learns divine viewpoint in their thinking and begin to
understand and appreciate the will of God and His plan for their life. The
believer also develops divine norms and standards. Rom. 8:16; Eph. 3:18; Eph.
4:23; Psalms 42:1; Psalms 119:131.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are
children of God,” (Romans 8:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the
breadth and length and height and depth,” (Ephesians 3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind,”
(Ephesians 4:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the choir director. A Maskil of the sons of Korah. As the
deer pants for the water brooks, So my soul pants for You, O God.” (Psalms
42:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“I opened my mouth wide and panted, For I longed for Your
commandments.” (Psalms 119:131, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Constructing an Edification Complex of the Soul</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As the believer grows spiritually, the edification
complex is being built in the right lobe of the soul from the believed <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine. As the believer grows, they reflect more of the glory of God. 1
Cor. 6:20; Luke 8:16-18; Matt. 5:13-16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For you have been bought with a price: therefore glorify God
in your body.” (1 Corinthians 6:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Now no one after lighting a lamp covers it over with a
container, or puts it under a bed; but he puts it on a lampstand, so that those
who come in may see the light. &quot;For nothing is hidden that will not become
evident, nor anything secret that will not be known and come to light. &quot;So
take care how you listen; for whoever has, to him more shall be given; and
whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has shall be taken away from
him.&quot;” (Luke 8:16-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt has
become tasteless, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for
anything, except to be thrown out and trampled under foot by men. &quot;You are
the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden; nor does anyone
light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on the lampstand, and it gives
light to all who are in the house. &quot;Let your light shine before men in
such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in
heaven.” (Matthew 5:13-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Residual doctrine in the right lobe of the soul or <i>epignosis</i>
is used as a frame of reference. From that you become oriented to grace. As you
grow further, you begin to master the details of life which produces a more
consistent relaxed mental attitude. With this doctrinal thinking you have fewer
mental attitude sins, the flow of <i>agapao</i> love produces a capacity to
love. This includes <i>phileo</i> love, a rapport love with God, wife,
children, and others. Finally, as you mature further, you gain an inner
happiness that is a mark of spiritual maturity. Eph. 4:12; Eph. 4:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“for the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to
the building up of the body of Christ;” (Ephesians 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by
what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual
part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love.”
(Ephesians 4:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Bible Doctrine Divisions</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are four basic divisions of Bible doctrine which
all overlap. They are promises, techniques, doctrines, and principles.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Promises</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They are great in number of God's promises in Scripture.
There are several thousand promises of salvation, about seven thousand promises
for the Christian life, and about three thousand promises for eternity. The
believer while filled with the Holy Spirit claims by faith that the promises in
the Word of God are true and trusts that God will do exactly what the verse
says He will do. This is relying on the faithfulness of God is the spiritual
life. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Taking Romans 8:28 by faith, the believer can think,
“Since all things work together for good, I know God has a plan for my life.
Not everything may be good, but it will work together for good that God’s plan
intends if I remain in fellowship and apply the Bible doctrine that I have
learned.”</p>

<p class=Verses>“And we know that God causes all things to work together for
good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.”
(Romans 8:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Taking 1 Peter 5:7 by faith, the believer can rest on the
fact that by casting their concerns on Him or trusting in God’s perfect
handling of any situation before they even happen, the believer can give thanks
for every happenstance, good or bad because of God's perfect character and plan.
</p>

<p class=Verses>“casting all your anxiety on Him, because He cares for you.” (1
Peter 5:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Taking 1 Samuel 17:47 by faith, the believer can have
confidence in the fact that the battle is the Lord’s because He is faithful. The
believer does not need to have a spirit of fear because God provides divine power,
love, and soundness of mind when they continue in fellowship believing God's
promises. </p>

<p class=Verses>“and that all this assembly may know that the LORD does not
deliver by sword or by spear; for the battle is the LORD'S and He will give you
into our hands.&quot;” (1 Samuel 17:47, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Taking Romans 8:31 by faith, the believer can trust in
the fact that their mental attitude is stabilized by knowing that if God is for
me, who can be against me? After all, God did the big thing by sending His Son
to die on the Cross for the sins of mankind and providing eternal salvation to
those who believe in our Lord’s work, therefore, He can easily take care of the
situations that come up in my daily living.” </p>

<p class=Verses>“What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who
is against us?” (Romans 8:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Techniques</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Techniques are used to grow spiritually and include techniques
such as confession of sin biblically where the believer names or cites known or
remembered sins to God the Father via 1 John 1:9. Confessing sin biblically
gets the believer back into fellowship with God. The filling of the Holy Spirit
keeps the believer in a state of fellowship or spirituality. </p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Faith-Rest Life is knowing, believing, and applying
God's promises, principles, and doctrines of the Word to experience and to the
situations you encounter in life. Faith-rest is maintaining one’s fellowship. Faith-rest
is related to the other basics of the spiritual life especially needful for the
new believer. Faith-rest is habitually claiming the promises of God with the
resultant inner peace and stability that God provides. Heb. 4:1-2. See category
on <a href="#_D-The_Faith-Rest_Life">The Faith-Rest Life</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, let us fear if, while a promise remains of entering
His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short of it. For indeed we have
had good news preached to us, just as they also; but the word they heard did
not profit them, because it was not united by faith in those who heard.”
(Hebrews 4:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Living in the Word is growing in fellowship and is a
technique based on 2 Timothy 2:15. To properly grow spiritually and use the
promises, techniques, doctrines and principles from the Word of God, you have
to have the right mental attitude. This is not a warmed-over version of the
power of positive thinking. This is a biblical technique for believers only. It
has to do with fellowship with God through your thinking processes. Rom. 12:2; Psalms
119:11; Isaiah 28:10; Psalms 1:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman
who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth.” (2
Timothy 2:15, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by
the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that
which is good and acceptable and perfect.” (Romans 12:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Your word I have treasured in my heart, That I may not sin
against You.” (Psalms 119:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For He says, 'Order on order, order on order, Line on
line, line on line, A little here, a little there.'&quot;” (Isaiah 28:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“How blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the
wicked, Nor stand in the path of sinners, Nor sit in the seat of scoffers! But
his delight is in the law of the LORD, And in His law he meditates day and
night.” (Psalms 1:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Occupation with Christ is the utilization to the full of
divine viewpoint of God’s Word in the thought processes and mental attitude. Occupation
with Christ is the expression of the believer’s mental attitude in fellowship.
Believers are what they think. This opens the whole realm of mental attitudes.
A believer’s success life and spiritual growth depend on what they think. Many
equate a tough person with a profane vocabulary or someone with a strong
physical stature, but toughness is a mental attitude. You are not beaten until
you give up mentally. Prov. 23:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For as he thinks within himself, so he is. He says to you,
&quot;Eat and drink!&quot; But his heart is not with you.” (Proverbs 23:7,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Doctrines </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Don’t be afraid of the word doctrine. It is the term for
Bible teaching in categories. The application of <i>epignosis</i> Bible
doctrine to life’s situations while filled with the Holy Spirit makes for
maximum spiritual stability in the soul. One example is understanding the basic
doctrines that occurred at salvation. See category on <a
href="#_Salvation,_40_Things">The 40 Things Received at Salvation</a>. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Another example is understanding the application of the doctrine
of the Essence of God to your spiritual life. See category on the <a
href="#_Essence_of_God_1">Essence of God</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Another example is understanding the doctrine of the
grace apparatus for perception that describes the only way for the believer to
grow spiritually. See category on the <a href="#_Grace_Apparatus_For">Grace
Apparatus for Perception</a>. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The adolescent believer utilizes promises, techniques,
and doctrines and handles them with more skill.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Principles, Laws and Commands</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Word of God, there are thousands of principles and
are sometimes called laws or commands. Three principles or laws that pertain to
other believers include the law of love in 1 Corinthians 8:1, the law of
liberty in 1 Corinthians 8:9, the law of expediency in 1 Corinthians 6:12, and
the law of supreme sacrifice in 1 Corinthians 9:3-6, 1 Corinthians 9:12, and 1
Corinthians 9:18-19. See category on the <a href="#_D-Laws_for_Doubtful">Laws
for Doubtful Things</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now concerning things sacrificed to idols, we know that we all
have knowledge. Knowledge makes arrogant, but love edifies.” (1 Corinthians
8:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But take care that this liberty of yours does not somehow
become a stumbling block to the weak.” (1 Corinthians 8:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“All things are lawful for me, but not all things are
profitable. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be mastered by
anything.” (1 Corinthians 6:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“My defense to those who examine me is this: Do we not have a
right to eat and drink? Do we not have a right to take along a believing wife,
even as the rest of the apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas? Or do
only Barnabas and I not have a right to refrain from working?” (1 Corinthians
9:3-6, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“If others share the right over you, do we not more?
Nevertheless, we did not use this right, but we endure all things so that we
will cause no hindrance to the gospel of Christ.” (1 Corinthians 9:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“What then is my reward? That, when I preach the gospel, I may
offer the gospel without charge, so as not to make full use of my right in the
gospel. For though I am free from all men, I have made myself a slave to all,
so that I may win more.” (1 Corinthians 9:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Stages of Spiritual Growth</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>From the standpoint of spiritual growth, all believers
fall into three categories - the babe or the “little children,” the adolescent
or sophomore believer or the “young men,” and the mature believer or the
“fathers.” The range of spiritual growth depends upon the amount of time spent taking
in Bible doctrine using the grace apparatus for perception and living in the spiritual
life. <i>Gnosis</i> has to be converted to <i>epignosis</i> by faith while
filled with the Holy Spirit. Bible doctrine must be properly absorbed. 1 John
2:12-14; Heb. 5:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I am writing to you, little children, because your sins have
been forgiven you for His name’s sake. I am writing to you, fathers, because
you know Him who has been from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men,
because you have overcome the evil one. I have written to you, children,
because you know the Father. I have written to you, fathers, because you know
Him who has been from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because
you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the
evil one.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 John 2:12-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For everyone who partakes only of milk is not accustomed to
the word of righteousness, for he is an infant.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 5:13,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Babe - the New Believer</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For the new believer or a babe in Christ, the first stage
of spiritual growth is to claim the promises of God. There are promises that
deal with salvation, with the Christian life and with eternity. There are also
promises that the new believer or babe can absorb and make a part of their
soul. John 3:16; 1 Thess. 5:18; Rev. 21:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For God so loved the world, that He gave His only
begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal
life.” (John 3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“in everything give thanks; for this is God's will for you in
Christ Jesus.” (1 Thessalonians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there
will no longer be any death; there will no longer be any mourning, or crying,
or pain; the first things have passed away.&quot;” (Revelation 21:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The babe or “little children” can produce divine good
through the filling of the Holy Spirit, but spend quite a bit of time out of
fellowship. The babe is not yet oriented to the grace of God or the plan of God,
often has a maximum amount of human viewpoint thinking, and very little divine
viewpoint thinking. The babe is unstable. The babe cannot talk about or
communicate Bible doctrine intelligently, as they do not yet have a doctrinal frame
of reference. The babe has to be entertained, amused, and must receive the
maximum attention of others. The babe cannot eat solid food (advanced Bible
doctrines), but can take in Bible doctrine basics. 1 Peter 2:2; 2 Peter 1:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“like newborn babies, long for the pure milk of the word, so
that by it you may grow in respect to salvation,” (1 Peter 2:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For by these He has granted to us His precious and magnificent
promises, so that by them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having
escaped the corruption that is in the world by lust.” (2 Peter 1:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The new or babe believer will be primarily interested in
using God's promises, if they are progressing normally in Bible truth. Taking a
number of Scriptures, they may reason this way, “Since all things work together
for good (not all things are good), but since everything works together for
good for the believer, I can cast all my cares upon Him. After all, the battle
is the Lord’s and if God be for me, who can be against me?” Rom. 8:28; 1 Peter
5:7; 1 Sam. 17:47; Rom. 8:31. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And we know that God causes all things to work together for
good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.”
(Romans 8:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“casting all your anxiety on Him, because He cares for you.” (1
Peter 5:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and that all this assembly may know that the LORD does not
deliver by sword or by spear; for the battle is the LORD'S and He will give you
into our hands.&quot;” (1 Samuel 17:47, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who
is against us?” (Romans 8:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Primarily the babe believer positive to Bible doctrine is
overjoyed at claiming God's promises. They are great in enablement. Using God's
promises pleases Him. A babe begins by using the promises and developing the
techniques. 2 Peter 1:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“seeing that His divine power has granted to us everything
pertaining to life and godliness, through the true knowledge of Him who called
us by His own glory and excellence.” (2 Peter 1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Each of us begin the Christian life as babes. The faith
used in salvation was very, very minute. It is described in the Word as a
mustard seed of faith. Immediately, we should begin to grow. The babe needs to
be taught. They need to learn to understand how to claim promises and how to
apply the Word to everyday life. To get the facts of Bible doctrine, they need
to attend all the services of a Bible teaching church that teaches the whole
counsel of the Word of God. Daily face to face teaching will enable them to grow
spiritually. This is done using the local church as the classroom with the
pastor-teacher being the authority. Luke 13:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and threw
into his own garden; and it grew and became a tree, and THE BIRDS OF THE AIR
NESTED IN ITS BRANCHES.&quot;” (Luke 13:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 5:11-14, some of the Corinthians had not grown
spiritually as expected in the length of time since they had been saved. They
were still “milk” Christians, just babes. 1 Cor. 3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Concerning him we have much to say, and it is hard to
explain, since you have become dull of hearing. For though by this time you
ought to be teachers, you have need again for someone to teach you the
elementary principles of the oracles of God, and you have come to need milk and
not solid food. For everyone who partakes only of milk is not accustomed to the
word of righteousness, for he is an infant. But solid food is for the mature,
who because of practice have their senses trained to discern good and evil.&quot; 
(Hebrews 5:11-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Where do you stand in your spiritual growth? Do you know
how to check your spiritual growth biblically? What are you depending upon to
reach others in your periphery for Christ? A program of some type?
Organization? Administration? Hustle? What? Well, the mature believer depends
upon Bible doctrine and application of that doctrine to experience to reach
out. Certainly the above are necessary, but the priority is the Word - knowing
the Word and letting it control the organization, administration, and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Adolescent - The Growing Believer</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The adolescent believer or “young men” in 1 John 2:13 uses
God's promises, but also uses techniques as well. The adolescent believer produces
some divine good through the filling of the Spirit and application of Bible
doctrine. The adolescent believer is learning more and more about how to
confess sin, how to have inner peace and stability, how to live in the Word,
how the Spirit of God controls the believer, and how to think divine viewpoint.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The adolescent believer often gets out of fellowship, can
be a potential troublemaker, but does use 1 John 1:9 consistently to maintain
fellowship. The adolescent believer is starting to get <i>epignosis</i> Bible
doctrine into the right lobe of the soul with a growing frame of reference. They
are applying Bible doctrine, but still have much growing to do. The adolescent
believer thinks they more mature than they actually are.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I am writing to you, fathers, because you know Him who has
been from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have
overcome the evil one. I have written to you, children, because you know the
Father.” (1 John 2:13, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They have their ups and downs, of course, but it is
usually quite apparent when they are in fellowship and when they are out. The
growing believer is breaking into doctrine and is beginning to realize that the
“blessed hope” can have an effect upon their life right now. They may
understand basically how the doctrine of the Angelic Conflict can help them in
witnessing to their neighbor.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Adult or Mature Believer</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The adult or mature believer has been exercising the
promises, techniques, and doctrines of the Word, but also use principles as
well. The spiritually mature believer produces a maximum amount of divine good
in their spiritual life. They reflect more and more the character and thinking of
Christ even conforming to His image. Gal. 5:22-23; Gal. 4:19; Rom. 8:28-29.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience,
kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things
there is no law.” (Galatians 5:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“My children, with whom I am again in labor until Christ is
formed in you—” (Galatians 4:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And we know that God causes all things to work together for
good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.
For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the
image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many brethren;”
(Romans 8:28-29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The mature believer is able to biblically handle the area
of doubtful things. The babe or growing believer may “taboo” a certain doubtful
thing, but the mature believer would arrive at their mode of conduct through
principles. The laws of doubtful things include the Law of Liberty, the Law of
Love, the Law of Expediency, and the Law of Supreme Sacrifice. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Law of Liberty means the believer has liberty to do a
certain doubtful things in their life that are not listed in the Bible as sins.
The Law of Love means that the believer uses their liberty do a certain
doubtful thing, but if it will it be a stumbling block to another believer,
then they chose to not do it in their presence. The Law of Expediency means
that all things are lawful, but they are not expedient. All things are not
fitting, or proper to be a testimony for Jesus Christ in the culture in which
we live. The Law of Supreme-Sacrifice means that the higher the leadership, sometimes
the greater the limitation in order to be the more effective. Example, the
Apostle Paul. See category on <a href="#_D-Laws_for_Doubtful">Laws for Doubtful
Things</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>While the growing believer has some <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine knowledge in the right lobe of their soul and may still act at
times like they know it all, the mature adult Christian will have gained the
following characteristics. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The spiritually mature believer has a maximum knowledge
of Bible doctrine - the facts from the Word of God. Their soul is saturated
with the Word of God. You can’t apply doctrine to experience unless you know
doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The spiritually mature believer has divine wisdom. This
is having the discernment to apply the right doctrine to experience. The adult
in growth has a maximum ability to do this.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The spiritually mature believer has a greater level or faith
or trust in God's Word. This is the ability in maximum measure to habitually
mix the promises, techniques, doctrines and principles of the Word of God to
any situation in life, whether it is a situation that involves pressure,
deception, a fiery trial, or disaster of some type.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The spiritually mature believer has a maximum
appreciation of the grace of God. They have the discernment to know when to keep
their mouth shut and when to talk.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The spiritually mature believer has maximum impact and
testimony. Their level of divine good production in the exceeding abundantly
category. The Lord can make maximum use of them and their spiritual gifts in
His plan. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Divine Viewpoint</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are two ways of thinking - divine viewpoint and
human viewpoint. Divine viewpoint is the way God thinks. Human viewpoint is the
way man thinks. Isaiah 55:7-9. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Let the wicked forsake his way And the unrighteous man his
thoughts; And let him return to the LORD, And He will have compassion on him,
And to our God, For He will abundantly pardon. &quot;For My thoughts are not
your thoughts, Nor are your ways My ways,&quot; declares the LORD. &quot;For as
the heavens are higher than the earth, So are My ways higher than your ways And
My thoughts than your thoughts.” (Isaiah 55:7-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The only source of divine viewpoint is the Bible. The
Word of God is the mind of Christ, therefore, we must know the Word of God to
know His mind and apply it to realize His will. The Word of God in the right
lobe of the soul is a critic of the believer’s thoughts and intentions. 1 Cor.
2:16; Phil. 2:5; Heb. 4:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT
HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.” (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ
Jesus,” (Philippians 2:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any
two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of
both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the
heart.” (Hebrews 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our thinking in the spiritual life must line up with
divine viewpoint. You can’t have peace in our soul without it. You are what you
think. Isaiah 26:3; Prov. 23:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;The steadfast of mind You will keep in perfect peace,
Because he trusts in You.” (Isaiah 26:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For as he thinks within himself, so he is. He says to you,
&quot;Eat and drink!&quot; But his heart is not with you.” (Proverbs 23:7,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer needs a mental attitude of divine viewpoint
and they can’t get it without Bible study and attending services where the
Bible is taught word for word, verse by verse. Bible study is being put down
today and so the Christian public has stopped thinking because they have
stopped studying. It is interesting when believers habitually attend Bible
class and regular services, they learn to concentrate, to think, and become
more and more stable. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When an individual accepts Christ as their Savior, they
do so by faith in Jesus Christ. That faith is only a mustard seed of faith. At
that instant, how much divine viewpoint do they have in their soul? Almost
none! This is just a mustard seed of divine viewpoint. All they know is that
they have accepted Jesus Christ as their Savior. They must now learn Bible
doctrine to begin to understand the thinking of Jesus Christ, the Word of God. Human
viewpoint needs to be displaced by divine viewpoint. How? By the renewing your
mind! Luke 13:19; 2 Peter 3:18; Rom. 12:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and threw
into his own garden; and it grew and became a tree, and THE BIRDS OF THE AIR
NESTED IN ITS BRANCHES.&quot;” (Luke 13:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory, both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.”
(2 Peter 3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by
the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that
which is good and acceptable and perfect.” (Romans 12:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You need divine viewpoint to please God and to fulfill
His plan for your life. Human viewpoint never pleases God no matter how
cultured or intelligent the thinking might be. The unsaved person carries human
viewpoint over from their work to their religion. They say, “I work for what I
get. The harder I work, the more I get.” The doctrinally oriented believer
knows that they has been saved by grace and they keeps walking after salvation
on a non-meritorious system called “faith.” Eph. 2:8-9. See category on <a
href="#_D-Divine_Viewpoint_vs.">Divine Viewpoint vs. Human Viewpoint</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not
of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one
may boast.” (Ephesians 2:8-9, NASB)</p>
