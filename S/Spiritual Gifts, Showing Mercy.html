<h2>Spiritual Gifts, Showing Mercy</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The permanent spiritual gift of Showing Mercy is found in
Romans 12:8. Showing mercy is an expression of unconditional love for all
believers, but the spiritual gift of showing mercy is quite different. The
believer with this gift will automatically show mercy, but only if there is
virtue love in their soul through spiritual advancement. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;or he who exhorts, in his exhortation; he who gives, with
liberality; he who leads, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with
cheerfulness.&quot;  (Romans 12:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 12:8, “shows mercy” is the present active
participle of <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>λεε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(eleeō) and means to have mercy on, to help one afflicted or seeking aid,
showing mercy. The word “cheerfulness” is <span lang=EL>ι</span>̔<span lang=EL>λαρο</span>́<span
lang=EL>της</span> (hilarotēs) and means cheerfulness, readiness of mind. This
is grace in action in the sphere of cheerfulness. Cheerfulness is not
translatable. This is a believer with an optimistic mental attitude, a divine
enablement, one who is not discouraged, is clear minded, and is able in their
mental attitude to grace out another believer.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Many believers often show mercy to others as an
expression of virtue love, but this is actually a spiritual gift that goes
beyond this normal function of the spiritual life. This gift is similar to the
gift of helps, except it is applicable primarily to the afflicted, to the
persecuted, and to those believers and even unbelievers who are victims of
tyranny. Therefore, it can be more dramatic than the gift of helps. In the
first century, the gift of showing mercy was helping Christians who were under
persecution or imprisoned. This put the one showing mercy in situations
dangerous to their own well-being. Hence, this spiritual gift is always related
to courageous acts of mercy.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Those with this gift have that special spiritual ability
to let you know that you have been forgiven of any offense that you may have caused
them or others. They make it very evident they are merciful. Some believers can
make the doctrine of forgiveness clear. This is God's grace in action. He has
forgiven and cleansed us and we all should be merciful. We are to forgive
others on that same basis. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some people have the ability to communicate this truth in
the exercise of this very important spiritual gift. When schisms take place in
the congregation, these people can help those involved to understand that they
are all part of the local church and the Body of Christ. It is a wonderful
spiritual gift and these people do it cheerfully. No matter how many times it
seems necessary, they do it as an expression of their inner happiness. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is a very practical spiritual gift. The divine
ability to see humor in a very grim situation. It is an encouragement at its
maximum without being human viewpoint in its application. These can show mercy
without pity. This spiritual gift keeps a balance in a local congregation
between grace as a principle (fact and existence) and grace as a function.
There must be grace thinking followed by grace action in a local church. This
spiritual gift is illustrated in and seen to function in Romans 12:14-15. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse.
Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep.&quot;  (Romans
12:14-15, NASB)</p>
