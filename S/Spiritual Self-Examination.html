<h2><a name="_Spirituality_1"></a>Spiritual Self-Examination</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every believer must often conduct a spiritual
self-examination to determine whether they are in fellowship and to assess
their level of spiritual maturity based on the <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine
in their soul. The first command in 2 Corinthians 13:5 is to “test yourselves
to see if you are in the faith.” This means to test yourself to discern whether
you are thinking and priorities in life are consistent with the Word of God
that you have learned. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Test yourselves to see if you are in the faith; examine
yourselves! Or do you not recognize this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is
in you—unless indeed you fail the test?” (2 Corinthians 13:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are responsible to God to examine or test ourselves,
but we can only examine ourselves if we have Bible doctrine in the right lobe
of our soul. This absolute standard is always the Word of God. Only through the
lens of Bible doctrine can we look at ourselves. How you feel about this is
never the standard for spiritual self-examination.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Test of Carnality or Spirituality</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The most important self-examination the believer must
learn to grow spiritually is to examine themselves regarding whether they are
in a state of sin or not. If the answer is yes, then confession of known sins
to God the Father is in order per 1 John 1:9. You have to have an awareness of
sin in your life before you can confess it to God the Father. Mental attitude
sins are the most common, so you examine yourself for fear, anger, animosity
toward others, resentment, worry, and anxiety. This spiritual self-examination
must be done at least once a day, if not more often.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Test of Priority of Bible Doctrine</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer must constantly review their scale of values
to confirm that Bible doctrine has number one priority in their life. If it is
not, that is the first error to correct. There are numerous attractive and
interesting distractions in life that can entice the believer to make them
number one in their life. Anything that seems more important than the
consistent intake of Bible doctrine even for a short time is a failure of this
inner self test.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Consistent daily learning and application of Bible
doctrine results in the believer conducting an accurate and objective
self-examination of their spiritual life. Without the consistent intake and
application of Bible doctrine, our spiritual life inevitably deteriorates. Any
reduced emphasis on Bible doctrine inevitably leads to placing something else
as a higher priority in life. Without positive volition toward the consistent
learning Bible doctrine, everything in the spiritual life deteriorates as the
believer remains in carnality for longer periods of time. Without spiritual
growth, no believer can fulfill God’s plan for their lives. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Test of The Basis for Relationships with Others</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer must examine their relationships with
others. Do those personal relationships include your mental attitude
unconditional <i>agapao</i> love regardless of their behavior? Without this
type of love based on the Bible doctrine in your soul, you cannot properly
develop your personal relationships. Our personal relationships with others
should not take first place. Our relationship with God should take first place
in our priorities. The believer cannot do this without <i>epignosis</i> Bible
doctrine in their soul.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Test of Whether Suffering is Deserved or
Undeserved</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer must gain an awareness of whether they are
under divine discipline and suffering from self-induced misery or whether they
are in fact in fellowship and filled with the Holy Spirit and experiencing
undeserved suffering. This type of spiritual discernment is important to either
correct your carnal spiritual status by confessions of sin or to continue in a
state of spirituality to rely on God's grace resources to handle the undeserved
suffering. Handling such undeserved suffering while remaining filled with God
the Holy Spirit produces divine good, results in spiritual growth, further
fulfillment of the plan of God for your life, and thus glorifies God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Test of Understanding the Indwelling of Jesus
Christ</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 13:5, “unless indeed you fail the test?”
refers in this context to whether the believer understands the doctrine of the
indwelling of the deity of Jesus Christ as the Shekinah Glory. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Test yourselves to see if you are in the faith; examine
yourselves! Or do you not recognize this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is
in you—unless indeed you fail the test?” (2 Corinthians 13:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Church Age, the permanent indwelling of the Holy
Spirit prepares a suitable residence in the physical body of every believer for
the permanent indwelling of the deity of Jesus Christ as the Shekinah Glory and
for the permanent indwelling of God the Father. This all occurs at the moment
of salvation. This makes the body of the believer the sanctuary or temple of
God. In the Old Testament, the sanctuary was the tabernacle in the tent in the
desert or the temple in Jerusalem. 1 Cor. 3:16-17; 1 Cor. 6:19-20.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Do you not know that you are a temple of God and that the
Spirit of God dwells in you? If any man destroys the temple of God, God will
destroy him, for the temple of God is holy, and that is what you are.&quot;  (1
Corinthians 3:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy
Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and that you are not your own?
For you have been bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your
body.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 6:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Failure of this test means either the believer is
ignorant of the doctrine of the indwelling of Jesus Christ or is not motivated
in their spiritual life by the understanding of the indwelling of Jesus Christ.
The indwelling of the deity of Jesus Christ as the Shekinah Glory is our
guarantee that divine blessings will be given to the believer who advances in
the spiritual life and fulfills the plan of God for their lives. These
blessings will be conveyed while the maturing believer lives on earth and also
the conveying of eternal rewards at the Judgment Seat of Christ. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The indwelling of Jesus Christ guarantees our eternal
security, our eternal life after death and a resurrection body at the Rapture
of the Church and into eternity. You cannot lose your salvation, no matter how
badly you fail in your life. The indwelling of the Son of God guarantees our
eternal life with Him forever. At physical death, the Son of God leaves our
body and escorts our soul and human spirit into the third heaven. You can’t see
Christ indwelling your body until your death. 2 Cor. 5:8; Psalms 23:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“we are of good courage, I say, and prefer rather to be absent
from the body and to be at home with the Lord.” (2 Corinthians 5:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
I fear no evil, for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.”
(Psalms 23:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The indwelling of Jesus Christ is a sign that every
Church Age believer is a member of the family of God, a royal priesthood. The Baptism
of the Holy Spirit is the means of forming the royal family of God. The
indwelling of Christ is the sign of the royal family and the uniqueness of the
Church Age. Because all believers in the Church Age are indwelt by Jesus
Christ, we have equal privilege and opportunity with all other believers. 1
Peter 2:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But you are A CHOSEN RACE, A royal PRIESTHOOD, A HOLY NATION,
A PEOPLE FOR God's OWN POSSESSION, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of
Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;” (1 Peter 2:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As a member of the royal family of God, the major issue
is the indwelling of the Shekinah Glory as well as the indwelling of God the
Father and God the Holy Spirit in your physical body. The indwelling of Jesus
Christ demands that the believer emphasize their relationship with God over
their relationships with people. If you emphasize relationship and fellowship
with people over relationship and fellowship with God, you cannot and never will
attain spiritual adulthood. Your life will be characterized by self-induced
misery and divine discipline.</p>
