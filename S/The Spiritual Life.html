<h2>The Spiritual Life</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the moment of salvation, every Church Age believer
receives their very own spiritual life tailored to their own soul and
personality. Your spiritual life is a grace gift from God and you are the only
one who can live it.  Believers are all different and each must live their own
spiritual life. No one else can live it for you.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has provided for every believer their spiritual life
empowered by God the Holy Spirit with a uniform set of biblical principles and
divine mandates. Your spiritual life is designed by God to enable you to live
the most rewarding life possible and glorify God in doing so. It’s all by God's
grace. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first one to ever use this unique spiritual life was
none other than our Lord Jesus Christ during His incarnation on earth. In the
resurrection, ascension, and session of our Lord Jesus Christ, God the Father
authorized the same spiritual life for all believers who would make up the Royal
Family of God, the Body of Christ, all Church Age believers. 1 Tim. 3:16; Eph.
1:17-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“By common confession, great is the mystery of godliness: He
who was revealed in the flesh, Was vindicated in the Spirit, Seen by angels,
Proclaimed among the nations, Believed on in the world, Taken up in glory.” (1
Timothy 3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory,
may give to you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of Him. I
pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, so that you will know what
is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance
in the saints,” (Ephesians 1:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Your volition determines how you live your spiritual life
and God's grace empowers it all. Consequently, you are responsible to God for
your own decisions, good or bad, positive or negative to Bible doctrine. Phil.
4:19; Eph. 3:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And my God will supply all your needs according to His riches
in glory in Christ Jesus.” (Philippians 4:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory,
to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inner man,” (Ephesians
3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God provide all of your needs in grace in the spiritual
life. As you learn Bible doctrine and grow spiritually, you begin to use God's
grace resources more and more. You come to depend on them. Only by living your
very own spiritual life using God's enabling power can you glorify God and
fulfill His will, purpose, and plan for your life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the moment of salvation, we are also entered into
union with the Lord Jesus Christ. This actually constitutes an eternal
relationship. This is also known as Positional Truth and Baptism of the Holy
Spirit. The way that we make our position relative to our experience is by
living within the spiritual life, which we enter at the moment of salvation
through the filling of the Holy Spirit. In order make use of this divine power
for the Christian life, we must understand all the components involved for
executing the plan of God for the Christian life, and growing up spiritually to
become a mature believer. God the Father has actually provided for every Church
Age believer His grace resources which are unique to the Church Age. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All of these grace resources, mechanics, and components
of experiential Christianity mean that we have more grace provisions in the
Church Age than any believer of any past or future dispensation has experienced
or ever will experience. Learning to use all of God's grace resources in the
spiritual life enable us to glorify God and to be productive for Him. Actually,
these components are the basis of all divine good production in the spiritual
life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You cannot handle the problems of life without your
spiritual life being operational under the filling of the Holy Spirit. Without
your spiritual life, God will administer divine discipline to get you to
confess sin biblically and thereby return to the spiritual life. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Components of the Spiritual Life</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The components of the spiritual life are; Confession of
Sin, the Filling of the Holy Spirit, Faith-Rest, Grace Orientation, Doctrinal
Orientation, Humility - Teachability, Personal Love for God, Impersonal or
Unconditional Love for All Mankind, Sharing the Happiness of God, and
Occupation with Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Confession of Sin</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The term for confession in the Greek is <span lang=EL>ομολογεω</span>
(homologeo) and means to cite, to name, to acknowledge, to classify as a sin the
thought, deed, or action the same as God does. This Greek word gives the idea
of two people coming to a common agreement on a matter. It is admitting to the
God the Father that what you have thought, said, or done is sin. The believer
realizes that this is sin based on the Bible doctrine in the right lobe (heart)
of their soul. 1 John 1:9 is addressed to believers only.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&quot;  (1 John
1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 John 1:9 , the word “If” is a third class condition
in the Greek and means that it is potential,  maybe the believer will confess
known sins biblically, maybe they won’t. But if they do, then the Lord is
faithful and just to forgive them the sins they remembered and named and to
cleanse them from all unrighteousness including the sins they forgot or were
unaware of. Confession means to recognize that sin named as one that has been
paid for by Jesus Christ on the Cross. Confession is the non-meritorious method
of dealing with family type sins. Confession is only made to God the Father
because God alone can forgive sin. Mark 2:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Why does this man speak that way? He is
blaspheming; who can forgive sins but God alone?&quot;&quot;  (Mark 2:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are to trust that the Word of God will identify what
God says is sin as part of the Bible doctrine that we learn and apply in our
Christian walk. God has provided this “grace” way of being cleansed from all
unrighteousness (sins that you did not know of) just by naming your known sins.
This is His grace! See category on <a href="#_Confession_of_Sin">Confession of
Sin</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Filling of the Holy Spirit</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We again become filled with the Holy Spirit when we
confess our known sins to God the Father using 1 John 1:9. This consistent
confession of sin and resultant control of your soul by the Holy Spirit which
allows learning Bible truth through the teaching ministry of the Holy Spirit.
Consistent intake and application of Bible truth results in the development of
confidence in life.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&quot;  (1 John
1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Holy Spirit empowers the believer’s spiritual life.
This is the same power that enables the believer to understand Bible doctrine
taught (<i>gnosis</i>) and to convert that believed doctrine to <i>epignosis</i>
in the right lobe of the soul. This intake and residency of believed Bible
teaching actually enables us to live our lives in the Word of God. This is our
daily study, knowing, and applying the Word of God. This is the important
springboard of advance in the spiritual life to eventually move us into
spiritual maturity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The filling or controlling ministry of the Holy Spirit is
needed every time you get out of fellowship. The believer is promised by God
the Father in 1 John 1:9, that every time the believer names or cites their
known sins to Him, He forgives the known sins and also the unknown or forgotten
sins and restores the believer’s soul to fellowship with Him. The believer is
now filled with the Holy Spirit and can learn and apply Bible doctrine to
life’s situations. Eph. 5:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation,
but be filled with the Spirit,&quot;  (Ephesians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All Church Age believers are given divine grace resources
as members of the royal family of God to fulfill the plan of God for our lives.
These resources are provided by God the Father. God the Son continues to uphold
and preserve the universe by the word of His power. Jesus Christ also
guarantees the protection of the positive believer for the fulfillment of His
will. The omnipotence of God the Holy Spirit provides the divine empowerment
for every believer to live and grow in the spiritual life designed for each of
us exactly as it was first used by the humanity of Jesus Christ while on earth.
See category on the <a href="#_D-Filling_of_the_1">Filling of the Holy Spirit</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Faith-Rest</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Faith-Rest is knowing, believing, and applying God's
promises, principles, and doctrines of the Word to experience. Faith-rest is
related to the other basics of the spiritual life especially needful for the
new believer. Confessing sin biblically gets one back into fellowship with God.
The filling of the Holy Spirit keeps one in a state of fellowship or
spirituality. Faith-rest is maintaining one’s fellowship. Living in the Word is
growing in fellowship. Occupation with Christ is the expression of the believer
in fellowship.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Faith-rest is based on daily doctrinal intake and
application of <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine to experience. Faith-rest
produces steadiness while in fellowship. The central source for faith-rest for
the new believer and all believers is the Word of God as promises, principles
and doctrines. Isaiah 33:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He will be the stability of your times, A wealth of
salvation, wisdom and knowledge; The fear of the LORD is his treasure.&quot; 
(Isaiah 33:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Within Isaiah 33:6, we find the basic ingredients for
faith-rest. This verse in the Hebrew and Septuagint Greek clarifies the English
text. There are several factors needful for faith-rest - wisdom and knowledge.
Wisdom in the Hebrew can be translated “skill.” “Knowledge” in the Greek
Septuagint means “expert in knowledge and experiential in nature.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The faith-rest life begins with a maximum exposure to the
truth of the Word of God, but it must be applied to life. In Isaiah 33:6, the
central purpose of faith-rest is to bring steadiness into the believer’s life
of fellowship. “Of your times” means a continuing period of time or time with a
durative quality. “Wealth of salvation” in the Hebrew means riches or
resources. The promises of the Word for the new believer are their riches.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ and received
salvation, it was based upon a promise of salvation. Many of the Scriptures
spell out this promise. When initial faith was exercised in the Lord Jesus
Christ, we received eternal life. Nowhere in the Word of God are we ever told
to stop believing. We continue to believe the promises of God. There are more
than 7,000 of them just for the believer in their Christian walk. Romans 8:28
is a promise as is 1 Peter 5:7. 1 Samuel 17:47 tells us that the battle is not
ours, but the Lord’s. See category on <a href="#_D-The_Faith-Rest_Life">The
Faith-Rest Life</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And we know that God causes all things to work together
for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His
purpose.&quot;  (Romans 8:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;casting all your anxiety on Him, because He cares for
you.&quot;  (1 Peter 5:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and that all this assembly may know that the LORD does
not deliver by sword or by spear; for the battle is the LORD'S and He will give
you into our hands.&quot;&quot;  (1 Samuel 17:47, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Grace Orientation</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Grace orientation is knowing that God treats you in grace
because of His character, not because of who and what you are. Grace
orientation is treating others in grace because you are operating on divine
viewpoint. Blessing from God is based on His character. Grace is what God is
free to do for any believer through Jesus Christ. We are blessed by God the
Father because we are in union with God the Son and God the Son is acceptable
to God the Father.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is impossible for any believer to get away from God's
grace. You can operate contrary to it, but you can never get away from it.
Believers have eternal security in Jesus Christ. Believers also receive divine
discipline when they remain out of fellowship. God is tapping His foot waiting
to bless us and we turn off the blessing when we sin. Isaiah 30:18-19.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore the LORD longs to be gracious to you, And
therefore He waits on high to have compassion on you. For the LORD is a God of
justice; How blessed are all those who long for Him. O people in Zion,
inhabitant in Jerusalem, you will weep no longer. He will surely be gracious to
you at the sound of your cry; when He hears it, He will answer you.&quot; 
(Isaiah 30:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Grace isn’t limited to us, but our understanding of
appropriation of and orientation to grace is limited by our lack of doctrine.
When you orient to grace, God’s grace provides for every situation (failure,
success, suffering, etc.) in which you find yourself. The believer, oriented to
grace, has a mental attitude of grace toward other believers. The believer
oriented to grace thinks divine viewpoint. The believer oriented to the grace
of God regards every day as a gift from God. Rom. 14:5-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;One person regards one day above another, another regards
every day alike. Each person must be fully convinced in his own mind. He who
observes the day, observes it for the Lord, and he who eats, does so for the
Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he who eats not, for the Lord he does not
eat, and gives thanks to God.&quot;  (Romans 14:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has designed the Christian way of life to be lived
one day at a time. If the believer is ever going to become productive, they
must oriented to the grace of God. If the believer is going to be oriented to
the grace of God, they must know Bible doctrine and learn what the plan of God
is for their lives. See category on <a href="#_Grace_Orientation">Grace
Orientation</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Doctrinal Orientation </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Doctrinal orientation results in the believer gaining
“sound judgment” or objective thinking based on the absolutes of the Word of
God. This thinking replaces or renews the subjective thinking of human
viewpoint to become divine viewpoint or grace thinking based on Bible doctrine
in the soul. The believer becomes more oriented to God's grace resources that
have been provided and are revealed through sound Bible doctrine. The believer
then gains a new spiritual perspective that reveals God's plan for their life.
Rom. 12:3; Rom. 14:5-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For through the grace given to me I say to everyone among you
not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think; but to think so as
to have sound judgment, as God has allotted to each a measure of faith.”
(Romans 12:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;One person regards one day above another, another regards
every day alike. Each person must be fully convinced in his own mind. He who
observes the day, observes it for the Lord, and he who eats, does so for the
Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he who eats not, for the Lord he does not
eat, and gives thanks to God.&quot;  (Romans 14:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Humility - Teachability</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Genuine humility includes teachability. This is authority
orientation to the Word of God and also to those who God has placed in
positions of authority over you. This humility includes orientation to the rule
of law, the laws of divine establishment and an understanding of the authority
included in the Divine Institutions that are a part of the laws of divine
establishment. 2 Cor. 13:10. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason I am writing these things while absent, so
that when present I need not use severity, in accordance with the authority
which the Lord gave me for building up and not for tearing down.” (2
Corinthians 13:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Peter 5:5, the Greek word for “humility” is <span
lang=EL>ταπεινοφροσυ</span>́<span lang=EL>νη</span> (tapeinophrosunē) and
means a mental attitude thought pattern of grace. Grace thinking recognizes
that we, at no time, earn or deserve any blessing from God.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;You younger men, likewise, be subject to your elders; and
all of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, for GOD IS
OPPOSED TO THE PROUD, BUT GIVES GRACE TO THE HUMBLE.&quot;  (1 Peter 5:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Humility understands that everything depends on who and
what God is and all that He has done. Humility-grace thinking causes the
believer to have no illusions about themselves. Thus, the believer has an
edification complex in their soul instead of an inferiority complex or
superiority complex. They have a relaxed mental attitude.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mental attitude humility produces a relaxed mental
attitude toward believers that have authority over you. This mental attitude
grace enables the spiritual believer to submit to the teaching authority of
another believer and the pastor-teacher in order to learn Bible doctrine. Only
true humility through the enabling power of the Holy Spirit allows Bible
doctrine to be learned. This spiritual growth process causes the believer to
become more mature spiritually. See category on <a href="#_Humility">Humility</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Personal Love for God </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The result of the consistent intake and application of
Bible truth is our personal love relationship with God the Father. Personal
love for God the Father is developed through spiritual growth whereby the
believer begins to better understand who God really is, His perfect grace plan,
and all that God has done, what He is continually doing to uphold the believer,
and what God has planned for the future. This is a love for God because of who
and what He is.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This personal love of God actually enables us to develop
a healthy self-esteem which is a biblical self-respect. This personal love
relationship with Jesus Christ also enables us to worship Him, be occupied with
Him, and have absolute confidence in who and what He is. Our perpetuation of
the faith-rest life also enables us to arrive at the point of personal love
towards God and biblical self-respect. See category on <a
href="#_The_Believer’s_Love">Love, The Believer's Love for God</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Impersonal or Unconditional Love For All Mankind </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Impersonal or unconditional love for others includes a
relaxed mental attitude toward others even under difficult circumstances. This
is a mental attitude of patience, forgiveness, graciousness, compassion, and
kindness toward others no matter what they have said or done even if that
includes opposition and hostility toward you. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is the unconditional love for others that depends on
the Bible doctrine in your soul, not the attractiveness of the object of that
love. This is the mental attitude that Jesus Christ demonstrated toward
everyone every day, even to those who were torturing Him and crucifying Him.
This is a very powerful love that reflects the believer’s level of spiritual
maturity and is the very thinking of Jesus Christ. 1 Cor. 2:16. See category on
<a href="#_The_Believer’s_Unconditional">Love, The Believer’s Unconditional
Love for Others</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT
HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.” (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Sharing the Happiness of God</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As the believer reaches spiritual maturity, they gain an
inner happiness or sharing the perfect happiness of God the Father. This is the
possession of inner happiness or actually possessing the happiness of God
within our souls. This is a happiness that masters the details of life without
depending on any person or anything else but the grace of God. Prov. 3:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“How blessed is the man who finds wisdom And the man who gains
understanding.” (Proverbs 3:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Happiness, in its fullest meaning, is the utmost pleasure
we are capable of enjoying in any given situation. Because we are referring to
inner happiness, it can be a situation of prosperity or suffering. Remember,
receiving and retaining inner happiness is something being possessed within our
souls, and is not conditioned by any overt situation or circumstance.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Inner happiness, or God's happiness, is still a potential
to the believer and depends upon their spiritual growth through the daily
intake and obedience to Bible truth. The first taste of inner happiness comes
from the filling of the Spirit. Happiness is the extension of a relaxed mental
attitude. Such happiness is a mental attitude of joy. Gal. 5:22; Rom. 14:17; 1
Thess. 1:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,
patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,&quot;  (Galatians 5:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but
righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.&quot;  (Romans 14:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;You also became imitators of us and of the Lord, having
received the word in much tribulation with the joy of the Holy Spirit,&quot; 
(1 Thessalonians 1:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The experience of inner happiness is limited by the
capacity developed from learning and applying Bible doctrine from positive
volition. If you have a maximum amount of <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in
the right lobe of your soul, you have capacity for great happiness. As a new
believer, you lack this capacity and only have the filling of the Spirit
without any Bible teaching in your soul as yet. In order to have great inner
happiness on a daily basis regardless of any circumstance in life, we must
possess maximum Bible doctrine in our soul. This provides the spiritual dynamic
to remain Spirit-filled a maximum amount of the time on a daily basis. The
believer carries happiness with them. Whether circumstances are pleasant or
unpleasant, they are the same.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Once you have achieved spiritual maturity through the
maximum intake and application of God's Word, the Lord then shares His own
happiness with you on a maximum basis. John 17:13; John 17:17; 1 John 1:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;But now I come to You; and these things I speak in
the world so that they may have My joy made full in themselves. &quot;  (John
17:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth.
&quot;  (John 17:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;These things we write, so that our joy may be made
complete.&quot;  (1 John 1:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Occupation with Jesus Christ</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One of the greatest components of the spiritual life is
occupation with the person of Christ. Being occupied with Christ is the
believer, filled with the Holy Spirit, functioning daily under the grace
apparatus for perception, and thus erecting the edification complex of the
soul. Occupation with Christ is a predisposition of the mind that sees all of
life from divine viewpoint, therefore, thinking with the mind of Christ. 1 Cor.
2:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT
HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.” (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>With consistent divine viewpoint thinking, the believer
can handle the most severe pressures and difficulties in life much like our
Lord did while on earth. It is wonderful to realize that we can enter into a
personal love relationship with God. Believers can achieve this spiritually
mature status by maintaining our filling of the Holy Spirit, learning the Word
of God on a daily basis, and applying the believed Bible doctrine to our lives.
The result is consistent spiritual growth. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Occupation with Christ is realized in the believer’s
thinking after their spiritual growth has developed a personal love for God and
an unconditional mental attitude <i>agapao</i> love for all who you meet in
life whether friendly or unfriendly. Occupation with Christ is the standard
operating procedure for the Christian life. Heb. 12:1-2. See category on <a
href="#_D-Occupation_with_Jesus">Occupation with Jesus Christ</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses
surrounding us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so
easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before
us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the
joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at
the right hand of the throne of God.” (Hebrews 12:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Benefits of the Spiritual Life </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The benefits of the spiritual life of the growing
believer include a relaxed mental attitude with no mental attitude sins and
thinking divine viewpoint. You think with divine viewpoint from the <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine in the right lobe of your soul and apply it to your daily living.
You are able to give someone the plan of salvation clearly and biblically. You
understand and gain confidence in your relationship with God more and more as
you grow spiritually. The norm and standard for your life is divine viewpoint. 2
Cor. 10:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But we will not boast beyond our measure, but within the
measure of the sphere which God apportioned to us as a measure, to reach even
as far as you.” (2 Corinthians 10:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The benefits of the spiritual life also include an effective
outreach of the Gospel. Believers have the opportunity to share the Gospel with
a friend and sense the leading of the Holy Spirit in it. None of this pressure,
door to door stuff, or peddling religion for the price of a booklet. This is the
actual thrill of seeing people saved. 2 Cor. 10:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For we are not overextending ourselves, as if we did not reach
to you, for we were the first to come even as far as you in the gospel of
Christ;” (2 Corinthians 10:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The spiritual life of the believer results in growth and
development. Spiritual growth moves you out of the babe stage spiritually where
you understand where you are in your growth stage. You put the priorities where
they should be and begin to enjoy the Christian life as God meant it to be
enjoyed. 2 Cor. 10:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“not boasting beyond our measure, that is, in other men's
labors, but with the hope that as your faith grows, we will be, within our
sphere, enlarged even more by you,” (2 Corinthians 10:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The benefits of the spiritual life of the growing
believer in a nation results in increased missionary activity within the nation
and in other countries. On an individual level, the growing believer begins to
function as an ambassador for Jesus Christ and as a believer priest. On a
national level, outreach develops through sound biblical missionaries, who are
categorical men, prepared men, men who are more than nice. They are sound in
their faith. 2 Cor. 10:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“so as to preach the gospel even to the regions beyond you, and
not to boast in what has been accomplished in the sphere of another.” (2
Corinthians 10:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Your thought life increasingly glorifies the Lord. You
understand that you are what you think. Your thinking lacks clutter and lacks
mental attitude sins. You have an increasing sharpness of the mental faculties,
regardless of your human IQ.  Your thinking is clear, reasonable, relaxed, and gracious.
2 Cor. 10:17; Prov. 23:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But HE WHO BOASTS IS TO BOAST IN THE LORD.” (2 Corinthians
10:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For as he thinks within himself, so he is. He says to you,
&quot;Eat and drink!&quot; But his heart is not with you.” (Proverbs 23:7,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You have no illusions about yourself. You know it’s who
and what God is that counts. You are oriented to the grace of God. You know the
human heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked. You’re not
running around trying to straighten everyone out like a spiritual private eye. 2
Cor. 10:18; Jer. 17:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For it is not he who commends himself that is approved, but he
whom the Lord commends.” (2 Corinthians 10:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;The heart is more deceitful than all else And is
desperately sick; Who can understand it?” (Jeremiah 17:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Daily Intake and Application of the Word</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Growing believers can keep their spiritual growth steady
and consistent by the same grace means that all believers maintain spiritual
growth - stay in fellowship and continue to learn and apply Bible doctrine.
Make it your very thinking - divine viewpoint. Psalms 119:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Beth. How can a young man keep his way pure? By keeping it
according to Your word.” (Psalms 119:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Stay out of the net of details of life which choke out
the Word of God. Luke 8:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;The seed which fell among the thorns, these are the ones
who have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with worries and
riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to maturity.” (Luke 8:14,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Stay out of the net of mental attitude sins that forms
scar tissue in the soul. In Hebrews 12:15, “defiled” is <span lang=EL>μιαι</span>́<span
lang=EL>νω</span> (miainō) and means to defile, to pollute, to sully, to contaminate,
to soil.</p>

<p class=Verses>“See to it that no one comes short of the grace of God; that no
root of bitterness springing up causes trouble, and by it many be defiled;”
(Hebrews 12:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Proverbs 20:1 and Proverbs 23:21 warn to stay out of the
net of alcoholism (drunkenness) that forms scar tissue in the soul. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Wine is a mocker, strong drink a brawler, And whoever is
intoxicated by it is not wise.” (Proverbs 20:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the heavy drinker and the glutton will come to poverty,
And drowsiness will clothe one with rags.” (Proverbs 23:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:11, “treasured” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>צפן</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(tsâphan) and means to stockpile, to hide, to treasure.
This is Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the soul. “That I may not sin
against You” means to throw away your treasure by making a false step downward,
by downgrading the priority of Bible doctrine from number one priority in your
life. 2 Corinthians 4:16 speaks of the renewing of the believer’s thinking from
spiritual growth even as the body ages. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Your word I have treasured in my heart, That I may not sin
against You.” (Psalms 119:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore we do not lose heart, but though our outer man is
decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day.” (2 Corinthians 4:16,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is a unique word in Psalms 119. The word is
“delight” or <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שָׁעַע</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(shaa) in the Hebrew
and is found in Psalms 119:16, Psalms 119:47, Psalms 119:70, Psalms 119:77, and
Psalms 119:174.  This is a term for embracing the Word of God and loving it
such that it means more to you than any other thing.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I shall delight in Your statutes; I shall not forget Your
word.” (Psalms 119:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“I shall delight in Your commandments, Which I love.” (Psalms
119:47, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Their heart is covered with fat, But I delight in Your law.”
(Psalms 119:70, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“May Your compassion come to me that I may live, For Your law
is my delight.” (Psalms 119:77, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“I long for Your salvation, O LORD, And Your law is my
delight.” (Psalms 119:174, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>How do we make the Word of God a higher priority and
anything else? By the renewing of your thinking as you grow spiritually. The
believer has an eternal relationship with Jesus Christ at salvation. The
believer grows spiritually while filled with the Holy Spirit and confessing
sins biblically to God the Father, claiming God's promises, living in the Word,
producing divine good, being occupied with Christ, and thinking divine
viewpoint. In this age of departure from categorical teaching, the Word of God is
the only answer! Rom. 12:2; Titus 3:5; Eph. 4:14-15. See category on <a
href="#_Spiritual_Growth">Spiritual Growth</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by
the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that
which is good and acceptable and perfect.” (Romans 12:2, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done in
righteousness, but according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration and
renewing by the Holy Spirit,” (Titus 3:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and
there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of
men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming; but speaking the truth in love, we
are to grow up in all aspects into Him who is the head, even Christ,”
(Ephesians 4:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Believer’s Walk</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are told to walk in Bible doctrine. We are to walk in
faith. The filling of the Holy Spirit is the only means to walk in the
spiritual life. The believer cannot learn doctrine if out of fellowship. This
means every believer is commanded to take in doctrine, transfer it by faith belief
to the right lobe of the soul as <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine applicable in
living the spiritual life or walking in the Spirit. 3 John 1:3; Heb. 4:1-3; Rom.
14:23; Gal. 5:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For I was very glad when brethren came and testified to your
truth, that is, how you are walking in truth.” (3 John 1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, let us fear if, while a promise remains of entering
His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short of it. For indeed we have
had good news preached to us, just as they also; but the word they heard did
not profit them, because it was not united by faith in those who heard. For we
who have believed enter that rest, just as He has said, &quot;AS I SWORE IN MY
WRATH, THEY SHALL NOT ENTER MY REST,&quot; although His works were finished
from the foundation of the world.” (Hebrews 4:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But he who doubts is condemned if he eats, because his eating
is not from faith; and whatever is not from faith is sin.” (Romans 14:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the
desire of the flesh.” (Galatians 5:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer is to walk in the Light. This emphasizes the
believer reflecting the glory of God by being filled with the Holy Spirit. 1
John 1:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but if we walk in the Light as He Himself is in the Light, we
have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us
from all sin.” (1 John 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are to walk in newness of life. The filling of the
Holy Spirit produces a different life, an inner love. You have a mental
attitude <i>agapao</i> love the brethren and you have a personal <i>phileo</i> love
for the Lord. You are oriented to the grace of God. You fulfill the principle
of worship, prayer, and witnessing. Rom. 6:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore we have been buried with Him through baptism into
death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the
Father, so we too might walk in newness of life.” (Romans 6:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer is to walk worthy of the Lord. We are also to
walk worthy of the vocation to which the believer has been called. Every
believer is in full time Christian service. This is being filled with the Holy
Spirit and fulfilling your ambassadorship both of which glorify the Lord Jesus
Christ. Eph. 4:1; Col. 1:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord, implore you to walk in
a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called,” (Ephesians
4:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“so that you will walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, to
please Him in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in
the knowledge of God;” (Colossians 1:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer is to walk honestly in each day. This means
to stay in fellowship and develop an edification structure whereby your life
will have impact for Christ. Rom. 13:13-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Let us behave properly as in the day, not in carousing and
drunkenness, not in sexual promiscuity and sensuality, not in strife and
jealousy. But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh
in regard to its lusts.” (Romans 13:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are to walk in good works. You produce divine good
works when filled with the Holy Spirit and functioning under the grace
apparatus for perception. Eph. 2:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good
works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.” (Ephesians
2:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer is to walk in love. The filling of the Holy
Spirit and the erection of an edification structure in the right lobe of the
soul results in the production of divine good or the fruit of the Spirit. Eph.
5:2; Rom. 5:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and walk in love, just as Christ also loved you and gave
Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma.”
(Ephesians 5:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been
poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.”
(Romans 5:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are to walk in wisdom in the application of Bible
doctrine to the situations and decisions that come to every believer. The Holy
Spirit teaches our human spirit when the believer is in fellowship. It is a
matter of divine guidance. Col. 4:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Conduct yourselves with wisdom toward outsiders, making the
most of the opportunity.” (Colossians 4:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To fulfill all these “walk admonitions” is to be
controlled by the Holy Spirit, transferring spiritual knowledge as it comes
into the mind from reading or from direct verbal communication from a
pastor-teacher. The positive believer understands the Bible doctrine or
spiritual information taught from the function of the Holy Spirit teaching
their human spirit. The Holy Spirit then transfers that spiritually understood
information to the left lobe of the soul as <i>gnosis</i> knowledge. Only by
the believer’s positive faith belief in that <i>gnosis</i> knowledge can the
Holy Spirit then convert it to <i>epignosis</i> or full knowledge and transfer
it to the right lobe of the soul or heart where it can then be applied in the
spiritual life. <i>Epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the soul is also applicable
to learning more Bible doctrine resulting in spiritual growth. See category on <a

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><a name="_Our_Attitude_Toward"></a><b>Falling Away From
the Spiritual Life  </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 5:1-10, Paul was teaching the Jewish believers
the doctrine of the High Priesthood of Christ, when he stopped and told them
why he is going to teach Hebrews 6 before he continued. They could not understand
what Paul was teaching because of their lack of spiritual growth and their continual
carnality (out of fellowship). They should have been teachers by this time, but
they still did not understand the basics of the Word of God. Heb. 6:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So also Christ did not glorify Himself so as to become a high
priest, but He who said to Him, &quot;YOU ARE MY SON, TODAY I HAVE BEGOTTEN
YOU&quot;; just as He says also in another passage, &quot;YOU ARE A PRIEST
FOREVER ACCORDING TO THE ORDER OF MELCHIZEDEK.&quot;” (Hebrews 5:5-6, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“Although He was a Son, He learned obedience from the things
which He suffered. And having been made perfect, He became to all those who
obey Him the source of eternal salvation, being designated by God as a high
priest according to the order of Melchizedek.” (Hebrews 5:8-10, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore leaving the elementary teaching about the Christ,
let us press on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from
dead works and of faith toward God, of instruction about washings and laying on
of hands, and the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment.” (Hebrews
6:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 6:1, “repentance from dead works” refers to human
good that is the best that an unbeliever can do and the best that a carnal
believer can do. None are acceptable to God. The filling of the Holy Spirit is
the only means of producing divine good that is acceptable to God because it is
performed solely using God’s grace resources through the enabling power of the
Holy Spirit. Isaiah 64:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For all of us have become like one who is unclean, And all our
righteous deeds are like a filthy garment; And all of us wither like a leaf,
And our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.” (Isaiah 64:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Faith toward God” refers to the faith-rest life. In
Hebrews 6:2, “instruction about washings” refers to the seven baptisms. “Laying
on of hands” refers to the identification with and was a doctrine used
especially at that time. “Resurrection of the dead” refers to the resurrection
of believers and unbelievers. “Eternal judgment” refers to the Great White
Throne Judgment of all unbelievers that will occur at the end of the
Millennium.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When this list is referred to again in Hebrews 6:6, only
the first basic doctrine is mentioned, but all six are referred to. This is
seen in the Greek grammar. One of the laws of interpretation of Scripture
reads: “The use of a word in context is determined by the first use of the word.”
Repentance was used in Hebrews 6:1 as the head of a list of basic doctrines.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Hebrews 6:3 says that God will permit them to grow up
spiritually. The first class condition of “if” in the Greek means if and it is
true.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And this we will do, if God permits.” (Hebrews 6:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Hebrews 6:4 starting with “For in the case of those who
have once been enlightened” through Hebrews 6:5 is a parenthesis and refers to
believers. This is once and for all enlightened and once and for all tasted. “Tasted”
is the same word as is used in Hebrews 2:9 where it says Jesus Christ should “taste
death for every man.” </p>

<p class=Verses>“For in the case of those who have once been enlightened and
have tasted of the heavenly gift and have been made partakers of the Holy
Spirit,” (Hebrews 6:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But we do see Him who was made for a little while lower than
the angels, namely, Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory
and honor, so that by the grace of God He might taste death for everyone.”
(Hebrews 2:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 6:6, “and then have fallen away” is an aorist
participle and should precede the action of the main verb which is “it is
impossible to renew.” These are Jewish believers and they are going to the
temple and offering sacrifices and confessing their sins to the priests. They
were not oriented to dispensations. They have “fallen away” not from their
salvation, but from their temporal fellowship with God because of what they had
been doing. These were believer priests and by doing this they were saying in
effect that the sacrifice of Jesus Christ was not efficacious “since they again
crucify to themselves the Son of God.” </p>

<p class=Verses>“and then have fallen away, it is impossible to renew them
again to repentance, since they again crucify to themselves the Son of God and
put Him to open shame.” (Hebrews 6:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Hebrews 6:4-6 should read: “Having fallen away (having
gotten out of fellowship) it is impossible for those who were once and for all
enlightened and have once and for all tasted of the heavenly gift, and were
made partakers (partners) of the Holy Spirit, and have once and for all tasted
of the good Word of God and the power of the world to come to renew (to teach
them) again unto repentance (the list of basic doctrines - see above) seeing
(so long as) they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put Him to
an open shame by the offering of sacrifices in the temple.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They were continually out of fellowship and it was
impossible to teach them again the basic doctrines mentioned while they are
still offering these sacrifices in the temple. Paul wanted them to return to
the teaching of the Word of God and to use confession of sin to God the Father
thus regaining the filling of the Holy Spirit. Rom. 6:16-19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do you not know that when you present yourselves to someone as
slaves for obedience, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin
resulting in death, or of obedience resulting in righteousness? But thanks be
to God that though you were slaves of sin, you became obedient from the heart
to that form of teaching to which you were committed, and having been freed
from sin, you became slaves of righteousness. I am speaking in human terms
because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you presented your members
as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness, resulting in further lawlessness, so
now present your members as slaves to righteousness, resulting in
sanctification.” (Romans 6:16-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Divine Good Production </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divine good is defined as all mental, verbal, and overt
activities performed by the believer while filled with the Holy Spirit. The
divine good actually is produced through the believer’s use of God's grace
resources and comes directly from God. 2 Thess. 2:16-17.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself and God our Father, who
has loved us and given us eternal comfort and good hope by grace, comfort and
strengthen your hearts in every good work and word.” (2 Thessalonians 2:16-17,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divine good production is based on application of <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine in the right lobe of your soul to life’s situations. Such
application can only be performed under the enabling power of the Holy Spirit.
It is a grace operation all the way. The believer’s spiritual growth and mental
attitude limit their divine good production. Eph. 2:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good
works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.” (Ephesians
2:10, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer produces divine good as they grow
spiritually and proportional to their level spiritual maturity. Obviously, if a
believer remains in fellowship more and more of the time, they will be thinking
divine viewpoint, they will be more of an encouragement to others, they will
find opportunities to witness to the unbeliever, and they will perform more and
more under their spiritual gift. All are divine good production. All glorify
God. 2 Tim. 3:16-17. See category on <a href="#_D-Divine_Good">Divine Good</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching,
for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; so that the man of
God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.” (2 Timothy 3:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><a name="_Spiritual_Maturity"></a><b>Spiritual Maturity</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual maturity is the believer’s final stage of
spiritual growth. It is the area for the normal function of the priesthood of
the mature believer, the place of perfect happiness and perfect benefit from
God’s grace. It is characterized by occupation with Christ, maximum capacity
for freedom, life, love, happiness, prosperity, and adversity. This is maximum <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual maturity is also characterized by an
overflowing of God's grace blessings in the form of promotion, wealth, success,
sex, social life, etc. As the believer matures spiritually, God begins to pour blessings
and He keeps pouring and pouring! The cup is maximum capacity from the Bible
doctrine resident and through the consistent function of the grace apparatus
for perception. Again, the believer reaps what God has sown. Psalms 23:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies;
You have anointed my head with oil; My cup overflows.” (Psalms 23:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The life of the spiritually maturity believer is
distinguished in God’s grace in James 4:6 which talks about “greater grace.” In
James 4:6, “greater” is <span lang=EL>με</span>́<span lang=EL>γας</span>
(megas) and means a thing to be highly esteemed for its excellence, God’s
preeminent blessings. See category on <a href="#_D-Spiritual_Maturity">Spiritual
Maturity</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But He gives a greater grace. Therefore it says, &quot;GOD IS
OPPOSED TO THE PROUD, BUT GIVES GRACE TO THE HUMBLE.&quot;” (James 4:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Mature Believer’s Testing</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Tests are designed to reveal your true character to
yourself. Tests are designed to reveal in overt activity your invisible
capability. Tests when passed are designed to enhance relationships and rapport
between individual believers. Tests are designed to bring <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine into action that possibly has only been learned and never
applied.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Tests of one person can bring a great deal of pressure on
others and sooner or later they become involved in the tests. Tests often come
in series and often in many different ways. Tests can be recognized by
believers with doctrine who stay in fellowship and do not form conclusions
until they get all the facts.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The higher the growth level of the believer, the more
sophisticated the tests become. Tests can ride in on the tail of a seemingly
neutral issue or problem. That which may be interpreted on the surface as
expressing one thing will give a totally different picture when viewed from the
standpoint of a specific test for a certain believer or set of believers. See
category on <a href="#_Testing">Testing</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritually mature believers should not fall into the trap
of being offended by someone else. In John 16:1, our Lord was speaking to His
disciples. “Stumbling” is the aorist passive subjunctive of <span lang=EL>σκανδαλι</span>́<span
lang=EL>ζω</span> (skandalizō) and means to not get shook up at the snare or
stumbling blocks put in your way. Don’t get shaken up when they are negative to
the Gospel. John 16:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;These things I have spoken to you so that you may be
kept from stumbling.” (John 16:1, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritually mature believers should realize that some who
oppose them will think they are doing God a service in their fierce opposition
to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. They will think they are doing God a service
when they dance on your dead body. John 16:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;They will make you outcasts from the synagogue, but an
hour is coming for everyone who kills you to think that he is offering service
to God.” (John 16:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God's Grace is Multiplied to You </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The functioning spiritual life multiplies grace in you
because the spiritual life is based on grace and required God's grace resources
to function. Grace never depends on our character, but on God's perfect
character. Grace is never subtracted from you, no matter how horrible you are. 
Only God can multiply grace in your life. He does not do it because you are
good or because you give or because you did something for God.  God multiplies
grace on the basis of who and what He is, never what who or what we are. The
policy of God with regard to your spiritual life is strictly grace. 2 Peter
1:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God
and of Jesus our Lord;” (2 Peter 1:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Grace is all that God is free to do for mankind without
compromising His perfect attributes and character. All things are received from
God as a free gift of grace. In grace, God provides every resource necessary
for the believer to execute His plan, His will, and His purpose for their life. 
Grace provision includes every blessing the believer will ever receive in both
time and eternity.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The result of living your spiritual life by grace is
peace with God in your soul. This is a tranquility and contentment based on the
<i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in your soul. Your spiritual life functions
based on Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the soul and enabled by the power
of God the Holy Spirit. Your spiritual life is what you think, not what you
feel. 2 Peter 1:3; Phil. 4:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“seeing that His divine power has granted to us everything
pertaining to life and godliness, through the true knowledge of Him who called
us by His own glory and excellence.” (2 Peter 1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“I can do all things through Him who strengthens me.”
(Philippians 4:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Peter 1:4, God has given to us “His precious and
magnificent promises” and refers to claiming the promises of God contained in
the Word of God or Bible doctrine. You cannot claim a promise without first
learning of it. When you claim God's promises, you are trusting that God will
do what He has promised. From knowledge of God's will, plan, and purpose for
our lives, we become partakers of His divine nature. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For by these He has granted to us His precious and magnificent
promises, so that by them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having
escaped the corruption that is in the world by lust.” (2 Peter 1:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Living your spiritual life must be motivated from within
your own soul. God demands that you live your spiritual life. 2 Peter 1:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now for this very reason also, applying all diligence, in your
faith supply moral excellence, and in your moral excellence, knowledge,” (2
Peter 1:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The spiritual life requires self-discipline and positive
volition to make it function as God intended. Self-discipline is not just a
physical thing, but requires motivation, thought, and reason. The spiritual
life is a daily function. The spiritual life is using the enabling power of the
filling of the Holy Spirit plus application of <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine
to life’s situations, problems, and decisions. 2 Peter 1:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and in your knowledge, self-control, and in your self-control,
perseverance, and in your perseverance, godliness,” (2 Peter 1:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Your spiritual life is not a set of activities that you
do or participate in, but what goes on in your soul. Only you can live your
spiritual life. No one else can live it for you. Each believer is solely
responsible for their own decisions, good or bad, positive or negative to
doctrine. You cannot blame others or what is in the world around you for your
failure to live your own spiritual life. Your spiritual life functions only
under the enabling power of the Holy Spirit using the power of the Word. Therefore,
Bible doctrine and the filling of the Holy Spirit must have number one priority
in your spiritual life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sooner or later you must assign number one priority to
Bible doctrine. The word of God is the revelation of God’s will, plan and
purpose for your life.  You cannot know the will of God apart from learning Bible
doctrine, the Word of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Dying Grace</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The spiritual life can be divided into living and dying.
Dying may be a long period or a short period, but for the believer and the
believer only, God provides a time of happiness and peace just prior to death.
Often this happiness is expressed just prior to the sudden death of the young
or middle aged. This is often said to be a tragedy because they had been so
happy. That happiness and the expression of it is simply dying grace, which the
Lord apparently gives to those believers whom He removes instantly.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the case of prolonged death from illness, dying grace
is provided in a different way. During prolonged illness, the believer has the
opportunity to provide a wonderful testimony to those around them. The Lord
helps that believer to have inner happiness and peace in the midst of pain.
There is no fear of death, no concern of death, and no falling apart in the
midst of death. For the believer who dies over a prolonged period of time, God
will provide in such a way that this time of dying is the most productive and
actually the most wonderful part of their lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is a point of ecstatics at the time of dying. If
you are with a believer who dies, you may notice a smile at the moment of
death, or the believer may comment about the room becoming light or utter the
name of the Lord. All believers get in on dying grace, regardless of how they
have lived. We don’t earn or deserve dying grace. It is grace. It is who and
what God is, not who and what we are. 2 Cor. 12:1-5. See category on <a
href="#_Doubtful_Things">Dying Grace</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Boasting is necessary, though it is not profitable; but I will
go on to visions and revelations of the Lord. I know a man in Christ who
fourteen years ago—whether in the body I do not know, or out of the body I do
not know, God knows—such a man was caught up to the third heaven. And I know
how such a man—whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know, God
knows— was caught up into Paradise and heard inexpressible words, which a man
is not permitted to speak. On behalf of such a man I will boast; but on my own
behalf I will not boast, except in regard to my weaknesses.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2
Corinthians 12:1-5, NASB)</p>
