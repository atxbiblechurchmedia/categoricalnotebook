<h2><a name="_Spirituality_Introduction"></a><a name="_Spirituality"></a>Spiritual
Performance</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual performance is the believer applying the <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine in their soul to the life they live. In doing so, correct
motivation is critical. Conviction motivates spiritual performance. Planning
then facilitates spiritual performance. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The sequence then would be to exercise positive volition
toward the plan of God, the communicator teaching it, and toward the Word of
God by listening to the pastor-teacher’s teaching while being filled with the
Holy Spirit. This would result in the Holy Spirit teaching your human spirit so
you can then understand what was taught resulting in the Holy Spirit
transferring that spiritual phenomena to the mind or left lobe of the soul as <i>gnosis</i>
or spiritual knowledge. Expressing faith belief in that <i>gnosis</i> results
in the Holy Spirit transferring it to the heart or the right lobe of the soul
as <i>epignosis</i> or full knowledge. Only here can Bible doctrine be applied.
God then provides testing in real life necessitating the application of the <i>epignosis</i>
doctrine. See category on the <a href="#_Grace_Apparatus_For">Grace Apparatus
for Perception</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual performance is the believer applying Bible
doctrine to life’s situations and decisions. It is a matter of doing. God
provides the divine enablement of the Holy Spirit to convert the academic Bible
doctrine into spiritually applicable doctrine. Isaiah 10:12; Psalms 57:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So it will be that when the Lord has completed all His
work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, He will say, &quot;I will punish the fruit
of the arrogant heart of the king of Assyria and the pomp of his
haughtiness.&quot;&quot;  (Isaiah 10:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I will cry to God Most High, To God who accomplishes all
things for me.&quot;  (Psalms 57:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are situations when other people are necessary in
assisting in the application of a doctrine. The first step in the direction of
spiritual performance is positive volition to the proper application of that
doctrine. Exodus 18:18; Psalms 119:106; Psalms 119:112.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;You will surely wear out, both yourself and these
people who are with you, for the task is too heavy for you; you cannot do it
alone.&quot;  (Exodus 18:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I have sworn and I will confirm it, That I will keep Your
righteous ordinances.&quot;  (Psalms 119:106, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I have inclined my heart to perform Your statutes
Forever, even to the end.&quot;  (Psalms 119:112, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual performance is to be done on a daily basis. Spiritual
performance is not accomplished in a general way, but by doing the specifics. Psalms
61:8; Rom. 15:28.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So I will sing praise to Your name forever, That I may
pay my vows day by day.&quot;  (Psalms 61:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore, when I have finished this, and have put my
seal on this fruit of theirs, I will go on by way of you to Spain.&quot; 
(Romans 15:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual performance of the believer is directly related
to the performance of God. As the performance of God is based on His character,
the performance of the believer is based on the character of Christ being
formed in us or spiritual maturity. Gal. 4:19; Rom. 4:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;My children, with whom I am again in labor until Christ
is formed in you—&quot;  (Galatians 4:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and being fully assured that what God had promised, He
was able also to perform.&quot;  (Romans 4:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One of the great hindrances to spiritual performance in
application is the matter of know-how. We apply doctrine on a daily basis and
bring it to a close each day. We close out the day, or a doctrine, by applying
it. Rom. 7:18; Luke 2:39.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my
flesh; for the willing is present in me, but the doing of the good is
not.&quot;  (Romans 7:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When they had performed everything according to the Law
of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own city of Nazareth.&quot; 
(Luke 2:39, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual performance is an event which verifies God's
promises. Application of a specific doctrine is the verification of the
academic understanding and belief in that doctrine. Luke 1:45.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;And blessed is she who believed that there would be
a fulfillment of what had been spoken to her by the Lord.&quot;&quot;  (Luke
1:45, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Behind every spiritual performance there is a right
attitude, a right understanding, a right plan, and a right purpose. Prov. 20:18;
Jer. 49:20; Jer. 49:30; Jer. 50:45; Jer. 51:29. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Prepare plans by consultation, And make war by wise
guidance.&quot;  (Proverbs 20:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore hear the plan of the LORD which He has planned
against Edom, and His purposes which He has purposed against the inhabitants of
Teman: surely they will drag them off, even the little ones of the flock;
surely He will make their pasture desolate because of them.&quot;  (Jeremiah
49:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Run away, flee! Dwell in the depths, O inhabitants
of Hazor,&quot; declares the LORD; &quot;For Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has
formed a plan against you And devised a scheme against you.&quot;  (Jeremiah
49:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore hear the plan of the LORD which He has planned
against Babylon, and His purposes which He has purposed against the land of the
Chaldeans: surely they will drag them off, even the little ones of the flock;
surely He will make their pasture desolate because of them.&quot;  (Jeremiah
50:45, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So the land quakes and writhes, For the purposes of the
LORD against Babylon stand, To make the land of Babylon A desolation without
inhabitants.&quot;  (Jeremiah 51:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There must be positive volition to learn and apply Bible
doctrine. In the application is a decided mental attitude of purpose to apply
that doctrine or doctrines. Purposes made have within them a relationship to
enjoyment or pleasure. Prov. 1:4; Isaiah 44:28.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;To give prudence to the naive, To the youth knowledge and
discretion,&quot;  (Proverbs 1:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot; It is I who says of Cyrus, ' He is My shepherd!
And he will perform all My desire.' And he declares of Jerusalem, 'She will be
built,' And of the temple, 'Your foundation will be laid.'&quot;&quot;  (Isaiah
44:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some purposes line up with your desires, while some
purposes line up with your responsibilities. Getting doctrine daily may line up
with your desires, while putting money in the offering plate may only line up
with your responsibility. Determining purposes is only the first phase of
performance, carrying them out is the objective. Isaiah 48:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Assemble, all of you, and listen! Who among them
has declared these things? The LORD loves him; he will carry out His good
pleasure on Babylon, And His arm will be against the Chaldeans.&quot;  (Isaiah
48:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Purposes are made while shutting out other interfering
and distracting things. Purposes must be firmly established in the heart but
the Lord has to direct the believer in bringing them to completion. He does
this one step at a time. Prov. 16:30; Prov. 16:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He who winks his eyes does so to devise perverse things;
He who compresses his lips brings evil to pass.&quot;  (Proverbs 16:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The mind of man plans his way, But the LORD directs his
steps.&quot;  (Proverbs 16:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Greek and Hebrew Words for Spiritual Performance</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 15:28, 2 Corinthians 8:11, Philippians 1:6, and
2 Corinthians 8:6, <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>πιτελε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (epiteleō) means to accomplish, finish, perfect, execute,
complete.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore, when I have finished this, and have put my
seal on this fruit of theirs, I will go on by way of you to Spain.&quot; 
(Romans 15:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But now finish doing it also, so that just as there was
the readiness to desire it, so there may be also the completion of it by your
ability.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 8:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; For I am confident of this very thing, that He who began
a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus.&quot; 
(Philippians 1:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So we urged Titus that as he had previously made a
beginning, so he would also complete in you this gracious work as well.&quot; 
(2 Corinthians 8:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 7:15, Romans 7:17-18, Romans 7:20, and
Ephesians 6:13, <span lang=EL>κατεργα</span>́<span lang=EL>ζομαι</span>
(katergazomai)  means to do, to perform, accomplish, to achieve.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For what I am doing, I do not understand; for I am not
practicing what I would like to do, but I am doing the very thing I
hate.&quot;  (Romans 7:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So now, no longer am I the one doing it, but sin which
dwells in me. For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh;
for the willing is present in me, but the doing of the good is not.&quot; 
(Romans 7:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But if I am doing the very thing I do not want, I am no
longer the one doing it, but sin which dwells in me.&quot;  (Romans 7:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore, take up the full armor of God, so that you
will be able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand
firm.&quot;  (Ephesians 6:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 4:21, <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>ργα</span>́<span
lang=EL>ζομαι</span> (ergazomai) means to perform, to actually accomplish.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and being fully assured that what God had promised, He
was able also to perform.&quot;  (Romans 4:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 2:39, <span lang=EL>τελε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(teleō) means to bring to a close, to finish, complete, fulfill, execute.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When they had performed everything according to the Law
of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own city of Nazareth.&quot; 
(Luke 2:39, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 1:45, <span lang=EL>τελει</span>́<span lang=EL>ωσις</span>
(teleiōsis) means a completing, a perfecting, the event which verifies a
promise, a consummation.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;And blessed is she who believed that there would be
a fulfillment of what had been spoken to her by the Lord.&quot;&quot;  (Luke
1:45, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 19:28, <span lang=EL>τελειο</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(teleioō) means to accomplish, to complete, to finish.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;After this, Jesus, knowing that all things had already
been accomplished, to fulfill the Scripture, said, &quot;I am thirsty.&quot;
&quot;  (John 19:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 2:11, “Discretion” is <span lang=EL>βουλη</span>́
(boulē) in the Septuagint or <span lang=AR-SA dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>מזמּה</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (mezimmâh) in the Hebrew. It means a
“reasoned wisdom and deliberation.” It denotes the result of deliberation, a
purpose, a project, a plan. It denotes the mechanics of making a purpose.
Thinking is basic to purpose and purpose is basic to performance.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Discretion will guard you, Understanding will watch over
you,&quot;  (Proverbs 2:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Isaiah 10:12, <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>בּצע</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>(bâtsa‛) means to finish, complete.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So it will be that when the Lord has completed all His
work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, He will say, &quot;I will punish the fruit
of the arrogant heart of the king of Assyria and the pomp of his
haughtiness.&quot;&quot;  (Isaiah 10:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 57:2 and Psalms 138:8, <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>גּמר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(gâmar) means to complete, accomplish, to bring to
completion. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I will cry to God Most High, To God who accomplishes all
things for me.&quot;  (Psalms 57:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The LORD will accomplish what concerns me; Your
lovingkindness, O LORD, is everlasting; Do not forsake the works of Your
hands.&quot;  (Psalms 138:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Micah 7:20, <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>נתן</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>(nâthan) means to give.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;You will give truth to Jacob And unchanging love to
Abraham, Which You swore to our forefathers From the days of old.&quot;  (Micah
7:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Exodus 18:18, Deuteronomy 3:13, Deuteronomy 23:23, 2
Samuel 21:14, 2 Chronicles 34:31, Psalms 119:112, and Jeremiah 1:12, <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>עָשָׂה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> (asah) means to be accomplished, performed, fulfilled,
executed, carried out.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;You will surely wear out, both yourself and these
people who are with you, for the task is too heavy for you; you cannot do it
alone.&quot;  (Exodus 18:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;You shall be careful to perform what goes out from
your lips, just as you have voluntarily vowed to the LORD your God, what you
have promised.&quot;  (Deuteronomy 23:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then the king stood in his place and made a covenant
before the LORD to walk after the LORD, and to keep His commandments and His
testimonies and His statutes with all his heart and with all his soul, to
perform the words of the covenant written in this book.&quot;  (2 Chronicles
34:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then the LORD said to me, &quot;You have seen well, for I
am watching over My word to perform it.&quot;&quot;  (Jeremiah 1:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 119:106, Ezekiel 13:6, and Jeremiah 51:29, <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>קוּם</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(qum) means to confirm, or fulfill, to
stand.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I have sworn and I will confirm it, That I will keep Your
righteous ordinances.&quot;  (Psalms 119:106, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;They see falsehood and lying divination who are
saying, 'The LORD declares,' when the LORD has not sent them; yet they hope for
the fulfillment of their word.&quot;  (Ezekiel 13:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So the land quakes and writhes, For the purposes of the
LORD against Babylon stand, To make the land of Babylon A desolation without
inhabitants.&quot;  (Jeremiah 51:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 61:8, Isaiah 19:21, Nahum 1:15, Job 23:14, Isaiah
44:26, and Isaiah 65:1 <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שָׁלֵם</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(shalem) and means to
make good, complete, performed.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So I will sing praise to Your name forever, That I may
pay my vows day by day.&quot;  (Psalms 61:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Thus the LORD will make Himself known to Egypt, and the
Egyptians will know the LORD in that day. They will even worship with sacrifice
and offering, and will make a vow to the LORD and perform it.&quot;  (Isaiah
19:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Behold, on the mountains the feet of him who brings good
news, Who announces peace! Celebrate your feasts, O Judah; Pay your vows. For
never again will the wicked one pass through you; He is cut off
completely.&quot;  (Nahum 1:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Confirming the word of His servant And performing the
purpose of His messengers. It is I who says of Jerusalem, 'She shall be
inhabited!' And of the cities of Judah, 'They shall be built.' And I will raise
up her ruins again. &quot;  (Isaiah 44:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 15:22, Proverbs 20:18, Jeremiah 49:20, Jeremiah
49:30, Jeremiah 50:45, and Jeremiah 51:29, <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>מחשׁבה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(machăshâbâh) means a device, a plan, a
purpose. Behind every spiritual performance there is a right understanding, a
right plan, and a right purpose.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Without consultation, plans are frustrated, But with many
counselors they succeed.&quot;  (Proverbs 15:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Prepare plans by consultation, And make war by wise
guidance.&quot;  (Proverbs 20:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore hear the plan of the LORD which He has planned
against Edom, and His purposes which He has purposed against the inhabitants of
Teman: surely they will drag them off, even the little ones of the flock;
surely He will make their pasture desolate because of them.&quot;  (Jeremiah
49:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Run away, flee! Dwell in the depths, O inhabitants
of Hazor,&quot; declares the LORD; &quot;For Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has
formed a plan against you And devised a scheme against you.&quot;  (Jeremiah
49:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore hear the plan of the LORD which He has planned
against Babylon, and His purposes which He has purposed against the land of the
Chaldeans: surely they will drag them off, even the little ones of the flock;
surely He will make their pasture desolate because of them.&quot;  (Jeremiah
50:45, NASB)</p>
