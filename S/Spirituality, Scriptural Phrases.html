<h2>Spirituality, Scriptural Phrases </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Greek word for spirituality is <span lang=EL>πνευματικος</span>
(pneumatikos) and means, in reference to people, one who is filled and
controlled by God the Holy Spirit. In a state of spirituality, the Holy Spirit
is the only agent for learning Bible doctrine communicated to the believer via
the grace apparatus for perception. The Holy Spirit also brings to the
believer’s mind the <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the right lobe of their
soul for application to life’s situations and decisions. This involves the
believer’s thinking, opinions, precepts, and maxims ascribable to the Holy Spirit
working in the soul. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The “spiritual gift” of Romans 1:11 has a special
reference to “knowledge, gift of divine grace.”</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For I long to see you so that I may impart some spiritual
gift to you, that you may be established;&quot;  (Romans 1:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Law is
spiritual. Romans 7:14 expresses the fact that the Law contains and expresses
the thoughts, opinions, and precepts of God the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For we know that the Law is spiritual, but I am of flesh,
sold into bondage to sin.&quot;  (Romans 7:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Their spiritual things” in Romans 15:27 refers to
products of the Spirit conveyed by the pastor-teacher in public assembly.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Yes, they were pleased to do so, and they are indebted to
them. For if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual things, they are
indebted to minister to them also in material things.&quot;  (Romans 15:27,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Spiritual thoughts with spiritual words” refers to
comparing spiritual things with a spiritual frame of reference. 1 Cor. 2:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;which things we also speak, not in words taught by human
wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, combining spiritual thoughts with
spiritual words. &quot;  (1 Corinthians 2:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“He who is spiritual appraises all things” refers to the
state of being in fellowship with God the Holy Spirit as a believer and the
abiding results. 1 Cor. 2:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But he who is spiritual appraises all things, yet he
himself is appraised by no one.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 2:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Could not speak to you as to spiritual men” refers to
the state of being in fellowship contrasted to being carnal. 1 Cor. 3:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual
men, but as to men of flesh, as to infants in Christ.&quot;  (1 Corinthians
3:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Spiritual things” refers to the communication of
doctrine and all its benefit and is related to financial renumeration in carnal
things. 1 Cor. 9:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If we sowed spiritual things in you, is it too much if we
reap material things from you?&quot;  (1 Corinthians 9:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“All ate the same spiritual food” refers to divine
provision, food provided by God in the wilderness. Relates the term “spiritual”
to natural provision, and by analogy to “food of the mature.” 1 Cor. 10:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and all ate the same spiritual food;&quot;  (1
Corinthians 10:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“All drink the same spiritual drink” refers to divine
provision for the soul, water of life, provision for the soul, and spiritual
provision for the soul. 1 Cor. 10:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and all drank the same spiritual drink, for they were
drinking from a spiritual rock which followed them; and the rock was
Christ.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 10:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Concerning spiritual gifts” refers to spiritual gifts
possessed by believers which they have received of the Holy Spirit at salvation
and are enabling expressions of the Holy Spirit. 1 Cor. 12:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I do not want
you to be unaware.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 12:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Thinks he is a prophet or spiritual” refers to
Corinthian believers that need to understand that the writings of Paul are the
commandments of the Lord. 1 Cor. 14:37.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, let him
recognize that the things which I write to you are the Lord's
commandment.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 14:37, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body”
refers to the fact that the resurrection body will have the characteristics far
different from your physical body. It will not be restricted by the temporal
realm, not visible, but can be contrasted to the natural body. 1 Cor. 15:44-46.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body.
If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body. So also it is
written, &quot;The first MAN, Adam, BECAME A LIVING SOUL.&quot; The last Adam
became a life-giving spirit. However, the spiritual is not first, but the
natural; then the spiritual.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 15:44-46, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The order of sequence: first human things then spiritual
things; first the unbeliever then the believer in fellowship and spiritual;
first the natural body then the spiritual body. In Galatians 6:1, “you who are
spiritual, restore such a one” refers to the principle of spirituality as the
basis for discerning a fellow believer and assisting in their restoration to
the filling of the Holy Spirit. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Brethren, even if anyone is caught in any trespass, you
who are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; each one
looking to yourself, so that you too will not be tempted.&quot;  (Galatians
6:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Every spiritual blessing” used in the adjectival sense
that the blessings of eternity have the character of the Spirit within them.
They are not of temporal character, of human, earthly, or consequence, but
rather with characteristics of the Holy Spirit. Eph. 1:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in
Christ,&quot;  (Ephesians 1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Spiritual songs” refer to songs of praise to God or
Christ. “Spiritual” here is related to the mutual expression of the believers
in worship. Col. 3:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Let the word of Christ richly dwell within you, with all
wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual
songs, singing with thankfulness in your hearts to God.&quot;  (Colossians
3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Against spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly
places” refers to the wickedness of the character of “wickedness of the spirit
world or regions.” This is used in contrast to the normal wickedness of
humanity. Eph. 6:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but
against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this
darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.
&quot;  (Ephesians 6:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Colossians 1:9, “spiritual wisdom” refers to facts of
the Word of God illuminated by the Holy Spirit, believed and transferred, thus
fitting into the soul’s frame of reference. This is <i>epignosis</i> Bible
doctrine in the right lobe of the soul ready for application in the spiritual
life in the form of divine wisdom and understanding. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For this reason also, since the day we heard of it, we
have not ceased to pray for you and to ask that you may be filled with the
knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,&quot; 
(Colossians 1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Built up as a spiritual house” refers to the invisible Body
of Christ, produced by the Holy Spirit through the expression of the spiritual
gifts of the many members. Each block in the spiritual house is completed as
each comes to spiritual maturity and takes its place in the house, glorifying
the owner of the house, even Jesus Christ. “To offer up spiritual sacrifices”
refers to the production of the believer in fellowship based on the analogy of
the temple building and its sacrifice system. The function of the temple was to
house and express the sacrifice system. We as the temple of living stones in a
spiritual house have the intent and purpose of glorifying God through our
identification with the various doctrines of Christ and His person and work. 1
Peter 2:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;you also, as living stones, are being built up as a
spiritual house for a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices
acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.&quot;  (1 Peter 2:5, NASB)</p>
