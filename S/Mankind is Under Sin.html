<h2><a name="_All_Mankind_is"></a><a name="_D-Mankind_is_Under"></a><a
name="_Mankind_is_Under"></a>Mankind is Under Sin</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What does “under sin” mean? It means under the dominion,
under the power, under the rulership, under the bondage of sin. Illustration:
Let’s say I am going to dominate some guy by making him shine my shoes when he
doesn’t want to. I come up to him and say, “Peter, shine my shoes!” But he
won’t do it. So I knock him down. When he struggles to his feet I ask him to
shine my shoes. But he still won’t do it. So I knock him down again. Finally he
shines my shoes. The next day I only have to knock him down once and he shines
my shoes. The next day I just have to ask him and by the end of the month I say
“Jump” and he says, “How high?” I have dominated him. He has been pushed down
to do my will. Sin does this to the human race. Every member of  the human race
is under the rulership and dominion of sin, completely and totally. It is the
biggest bully and it dominates all of us. The judicial verdict is that both Jew
and Gentile are under the dominion of sin. Rom. 3:9-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;What then? Are we better than they? Not at all; for we
have already charged that both Jews and Greeks are all under sin; as it is
written, &quot;THERE IS NONE RIGHTEOUS, NOT EVEN ONE; THERE IS NONE WHO
UNDERSTANDS, THERE IS NONE WHO SEEKS FOR GOD;&quot;  (Romans 3:9-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Romans 3:10-18 describes the human race under the
dominion of sin. </p>

<p class=Verses>“as it is written, &quot;THERE IS NONE RIGHTEOUS, NOT EVEN ONE;
THERE IS NONE WHO UNDERSTANDS, THERE IS NONE WHO SEEKS FOR GOD; ALL HAVE TURNED
ASIDE, TOGETHER THEY HAVE BECOME USELESS; THERE IS NONE WHO DOES GOOD, THERE IS
NOT EVEN ONE.&quot; &quot;THEIR THROAT IS AN OPEN GRAVE, WITH THEIR TONGUES
THEY KEEP DECEIVING,&quot; &quot;THE POISON OF ASPS IS UNDER THEIR LIPS&quot;;
&quot;WHOSE MOUTH IS FULL OF CURSING AND BITTERNESS&quot;; &quot;THEIR FEET ARE
SWIFT TO SHED BLOOD, DESTRUCTION AND MISERY ARE IN THEIR PATHS, AND THE PATH OF
PEACE THEY HAVE NOT KNOWN.&quot; &quot;THERE IS NO FEAR OF GOD BEFORE THEIR
EYES.&quot;” (Romans 3:10-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;ALL HAVE TURNED ASIDE, TOGETHER THEY HAVE BECOME USELESS;
THERE IS NONE WHO DOES GOOD, THERE IS NOT EVEN ONE.&quot;&quot;  (Romans 3:12,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God, the great physician, tells them to open their mouth
so he can look at their throat and tongue, just like doctors today. When they
stick out their tongue and say “ahh,” God smells their bad breath. The tongue
turns out to be forked, like an asp snake. Rom. 3:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;THEIR THROAT IS AN OPEN GRAVE, WITH THEIR TONGUES
THEY KEEP DECEIVING,&quot; &quot;THE POISON OF ASPS IS UNDER THEIR
LIPS&quot;;&quot;  (Romans 3:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Romans 3:14 describes the average factory where the
discontented and critical workers cuss and gripe their way through the day. Romans
3:15 is a spiritual x-ray of the human race without Christ. In Romans 3:16-18
is the working motto of the United Nations.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;WHOSE MOUTH IS FULL OF CURSING AND
BITTERNESS&quot;;&quot;  (Romans 3:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;THEIR FEET ARE SWIFT TO SHED BLOOD,&quot;  (Romans
3:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;DESTRUCTION AND MISERY ARE IN THEIR PATHS, AND THE PATH
OF PEACE THEY HAVE NOT KNOWN.&quot; &quot;THERE IS NO FEAR OF GOD BEFORE THEIR
EYES.&quot;&quot;  (Romans 3:16-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Does this series of verses describe the little sweet old
lady that lives down the block who is in some false cult and does not believe
in Jesus Christ? Yes, this is God’s description of every member of the human
race, even Adolf Eichmann. We have a problem today. It is hard to get people to
recognize that they are lost. Very few are willing to admit they are lost. They
try to justify themselves by baptism, membership, and doing good deeds. Rom.
3:19-20.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now we know that whatever the Law says, it speaks to
those who are under the Law, so that every mouth may be closed and all the
world may become accountable to God; because by the works of the Law no flesh
will be justified in His sight; for through the Law comes the knowledge of
sin.&quot;  (Romans 3:19-20, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In almost any city, if you ask the average man on the
street, “Are you born-again?” he would say, “I’m Catholic” or I’m a Methodist”
or I’m a Mormon.” This means nothing. The Bible isn’t a denominational Bible.
It doesn’t belong to some brand of people. It is the Word of God and is the
final standard of divine authority. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What does the Mosaic Law state? It says I am guilty. It
puts a zipper on my mouth. It points out my sin. This lesson is hard on the
dignity of man, but we need not be afraid of truth! One of today’s biggest
tragedies would be Sunday School teachers telling children that if they keep the
Ten Commandments, they would go to heaven. Or, trying to keep them as best they
can will suffice. Remember that the Bible does not teach that you go to heaven
because you are good, or even go to hell because you are bad. One goes to
heaven by simply accepting Jesus Christ as Savior. The issue is not how good or
bad you may be. One goes to hell for simply not accepting Jesus Christ as
Savior. People who lived good lives on earth will be in hell and people who
lived bad lives on earth will be in heaven. The only consequential issue in
life is what did they do with the claims of Christ before death?</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>So, the Ten Commandments show me I am sinful and I need a
cleansing through the Savior. Everyone should understand the plan of salvation
and how to be cleansed by faith in the salvation promise. However, some may not
be convinced that they are lost, even yet. Has there ever been a time when you
accepted Jesus Christ as your personal Savior and recognized that you were
lost?</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Romans 3:20 says “for through the Law comes the knowledge
of sin.” Then, how can I be saved? By saying to Him, “God, I realize that I
have sinned, right now I believe that Jesus Christ died on the Cross for my
sins and I accept Him as my Savior.” You now have God's very own eternal life! You
are now born again! You don’t have to blink your eyes, yell, scream, or feel
good. You just simply receive Him by faith. John 1:12; John 3:36; Gal. 3:13-16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to
become children of God, even to those who believe in His name,&quot;  (John
1:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he
who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on
him.&quot;&quot;  (John 3:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law, having
become a curse for us—for it is written, &quot;CURSED IS EVERYONE WHO HANGS ON
A TREE&quot;— in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come
to the Gentiles, so that we would receive the promise of the Spirit through
faith. Brethren, I speak in terms of human relations: even though it is only a
man's covenant, yet when it has been ratified, no one sets it aside or adds
conditions to it. Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He does
not say, &quot;And to seeds,&quot; as referring to many, but rather to one,
&quot;And to your seed,&quot; that is, Christ.&quot;  (Galatians 3:13-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What relation do we sustain to the Abrahamic Covenant?
Why did Jesus Christ redeem us? So that the blessing of Abraham might come upon
us. The New Covenant guaranteed Israel what? A new heart, the indwelling of the
Holy Spirit. How does this blessing come to us? By salvation, the indwelling of
the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The real you, your soul is composed of;
self-consciousness, mentality, volition, and emotion. Self-consciousness that
makes you aware of your existence, the mentality is the thinking part of the
soul and includes the left lobe and the right lobe, volition is the decider of
the soul, and emotion is the appreciator of the soul. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Because the unsaved human being does not have a human
spirit, God the Holy Spirit must deal directly with the soul. This is the
doctrine of the convicting ministry of the Holy Spirit. For the unbeliever, the
Holy Spirit acts as a human spirit and makes Gospel information clear to them
and puts it into the left lobe or mentality of the soul. With this information
in the mentality of the soul, self-consciousness becomes oriented to a new set
of circumstances and a new plan, the plan of salvation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The self-consciousness becomes aware of man’s inadequacy
and God’s perfect provision. Positive volition makes the decision to believe in
Christ, a non-meritorious act. It may or may not be accompanied by emotion or
appreciation. Some people say that when they were saved, they had a great
emotional experience. Some have no emotional response and some are in between.
The conscience in the right lobe of the soul for the first time has a new norm
or standard called grace, entirely different from anything known before.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For the first time, the old sin nature gets its
come-uppance for at the point of salvation we are not only indwelt by the Holy
Spirit, but filled with the Holy Spirit. The first sin we commit gets us out of
fellowship and fellowship can only be recovered by confessing sin biblically
using 1 John 1:9. When the believer is in fellowship, the old sin nature is
frustrated and cannot control the soul. At the moment of salvation, the human
spirit is reactivated and becomes a new capability to learn and understand
spiritual information by which we can grow spiritually. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&quot;  (1 John
1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Old Sin Nature of Man</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Romans 3:23 presents the sin part of man. But the old sin
nature of man also has a human good part. Romans 1 deals with the sin part and
Romans 2 deals with the human good part. Below is a diagram of the
genetically-formed old sin nature that resides in every cell of every human
being, except Jesus Christ. </p>

<p class=Verses>“for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,”
(Romans 3:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><img width=500 height=420 id="Picture 1"
src="Mankind%20is%20Under%20Sin.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Romans 1:18 introduces us to the wrath of God. This is
righteous judgment directed against ungodliness and unrighteousness. The old
sin nature has a trend toward sin with another trend toward human good. This
righteous anger is the outcome of those who do something mentioned in this
verse, “who suppress the truth in unrighteousness.” This means that there is
suppression of God’s truth. Truth is held down and concealed. This results in
sin.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all
ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in
unrighteousness,&quot;  (Romans 1:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As an illustration, suppose I had a small kitten under my
hand and kept suppressing it, pushing it down, cutting off its air. What would
happen? It would die. So here, suppression of truth results in continued deeds
of spiritual death - sins.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Romans 1:19 is not talking about Christians, but all
normal humanity which has God-consciousness. Every normal human being is
conscious of God at one time or another. They may suppress this consciousness
and remain unsaved, or suppress truth by twisting it and becoming religious
without Christ. Or they may become a fool, declaring themselves an atheist. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;because that which is known about God is evident within
them; for God made it evident to them.&quot;  (Romans 1:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Unsaved man can be conscious concerning God's creation that
is visible all around them and realize that somebody is greater than we are.
They are also conscious of God's power and Godhood. Appreciating creation won’t
save and God-consciousness won’t save, but they make us conscious that God does
exist and must be reckoned with. These people will be fed more information
concerning God in the form of the Gospel. If they respond to the convicting
ministry of the Holy Spirit bringing them to faith belief in Jesus Christ, they
become saved. They become believers with an eternal relationship with Jesus
Christ. Rom. 1:20; Eph. 2:8-9. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For since the creation of the world His invisible
attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being
understood through what has been made, so that they are without excuse.&quot; 
(Romans 1:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not
of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one
may boast.” (Ephesians 2:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Before salvation or after salvation, a person can have
either negative or positive volition. If one says “no” to the convicting
ministry of the Holy Spirit before salvation, they stay unsaved. But if one
goes on positive signals, God will feed more information to that individual in
the form of the Gospel. It does not matter where the individual lives on this
earth, they can accept Christ even if they live in a very remote part of the
world. The Bible teaching on volition in no way violates the Bible teaching of
total depravity. It is the meeting place of the sovereignty of God and the free
will of man. Man can reject the Lord or he can accept Him. John 7:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;If anyone is willing to do His will, he will know
of the teaching, whether it is of God or whether I speak from Myself. &quot; 
(John 7:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Thus, this Romans 1 crowd got on negative signals at the
point of God-consciousness and suppressed truth. Where does this suppression of
truth lead? First of all, everyone is responsible for their own sin. Romans
1:20 says they are without excuse. Those who have never heard are just as lost
as those who have heard and not responded. Why? Every normal person has
God-consciousness and can have full facts of the Gospel, if they continue on
positive volitional signals. Abnormal people who never reach God-consciousness,
the mentally handicapped for example, go to heaven regardless of their age or
physical appearance. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Romans 1 crowd forsook God-consciousness. This led to
downgrading God and forsaking Him. Their intellect was darkened. They could not
know God. Their emotions were degraded. They could not love God. Their will was
deadened. They could not obey God. Rom. 1:21-23.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as
God or give thanks, but they became futile in their speculations, and their
foolish heart was darkened. Professing to be wise, they became fools, and
exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of
corruptible man and of birds and four-footed animals and crawling
creatures.&quot;  (Romans 1:21-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God then gave them up to lusts of their hearts to
impurity, exchanging the truth of God for a lie, worshiping and serving the
creature rather than the Creator. Rom. 1:24-26.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore God gave them over in the lusts of their hearts
to impurity, so that their bodies would be dishonored among them. For they
exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature
rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen. For this reason God gave
them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function
for that which is unnatural,&quot;  (Romans 1:24-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Those who no longer acknowledge God, God gives them over
to a depraved or reprobate mind. This is a mind totally abandoned to the whims
and desires of the base side of the old sin nature. This is a person totally on
negative signals. Rom. 1:28.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any
longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do those things which are not
proper,&quot;  (Romans 1:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>These things exhibit themselves in various sins that are
listed in Romans 1:26-32. Note that there are internal and overt sins.
Homosexuality is mentioned. Many American cities are plagued with this type of
perversion which is called sin by the Bible, not a sickness. Sodom in Old
Testament times was almost completely given over to this area of sin. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, greed,
evil; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice; they are gossips,
slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil,
disobedient to parents, without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving,
unmerciful; and although they know the ordinance of God, that those who
practice such things are worthy of death, they not only do the same, but also
give hearty approval to those who practice them.&quot;  (Romans 1:29-32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God can only judge when such sins are rampant. He
destroys a nation when the iniquity of a nation is full. This is dependent upon
the five cycles of discipline mentioned in Leviticus 26, also the iniquities of
the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation found in
Exodus 20, Proverbs 30:11-14, Proverbs 30:17, and last of all, the law of
sexual perversity. The latter puts an entire nation on negative signals and God
destroys that nation. This is the Fifth Cycle of Discipline. Many Old Testament
passages develop this as well as Romans 1.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;There is a kind of man who curses his father And does not
bless his mother. There is a kind who is pure in his own eyes, Yet is not
washed from his filthiness. There is a kind—oh how lofty are his eyes! And his
eyelids are raised in arrogance. There is a kind of man whose teeth are like
swords And his jaw teeth like knives, To devour the afflicted from the earth
And the needy from among men.&quot;  (Proverbs 30:11-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The eye that mocks a father And scorns a mother, The
ravens of the valley will pick it out, And the young eagles will eat it.&quot; 
(Proverbs 30:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some will no doubt be saved while attending Bible
classes. Others may not be Christians yet. Do we as Christians still have an
old sin nature after salvation? Yes. Is the possibility of doing these sins in
the ability of a Christian? Yes. What happens if we sin? Do we lose our
salvation and have to get saved all over again? No. They need to get back in
fellowship by using 1 John 1:9. Remember when a believer sins, they gets into
divine discipline from God. There is no license to sin after becoming a Christian.
Believers can and do sin after salvation. They can lie, for example and they
can gossip. They can have the worst sins of all, mental attitude sins. These
are sins of bitterness, hostility, hate, spite, pride, etc.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&quot;  (1 John
1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every now and then some wild-eyed, stoop shouldered
individual will come down the pike and say that once a person is saved, they
cease to sin and have no more problems with the old sin nature. Hogwash! 1 John
1:8-10 indicates that a believer will have their difficulties. Being saved is
just opening the door. The believer needs to grow in the Lord. Churches are
loaded these days with born again people who have never been fed Bible
doctrine. If you know where you can be fed, the Bible says you are responsible
before God to be there. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves
and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and
righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If
we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar and His word is not in
us.&quot;  (1 John 1:8-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As Christians, we are just plain stupid sometimes. Let’s
take a Kansas farm for example, where steers are fed extra at certain times of
the year to get them in shape for sale. Those steers must be fed and there are
feed boxes for that purpose. Imagine those hungry steers standing at the empty
feed box when there were full feed boxes near them where they could eat their
fill! Can you imagine them starving to death when they could simply walk over
to full feed boxes? Then, why is it that unbelievers are made fully aware of
God, but reject Him and the Gospel of Jesus Christ when all they had to do is
exercise their free will to accept God and then accept the saving work of Jesus
Christ on the Cross? This is the free will of mankind in action. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 1:23, we have a supplemental illustration of
idolatry in America. This verse is often applied to those “heathen” living in
dark Africa or India. Sometimes a class will really get worked up about the
terrible idol worship in other nations. And if they are denouncing them, let
them talk for a brief time concerning the so-called backward countries. Then
reverse the issue and say, “All right, don’t we suppress God in America? Don’t
the unsaved suppress truth?” </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an
image in the form of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed animals and
crawling creatures.&quot;  (Romans 1:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Let’s try another example. “Now God bothers me, gets on
my back and in my way, but yet I’m a bit uneasy about Him. Apparently I’ve got
a consciousness of God and I’m not sure I’m right with Him. And so, God bugs
me. So, I’m going to have to do something to please God, to appease God.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“I have decided to build God a beautiful altar because I
wouldn’t think of making a corrupt image of some idol at all, after all I’m
civilized. So I will make a beautiful altar with magnificent gold ornaments on
it, put lovely candles there in ornate holders, put on a marble top and it will
be a real knockout. And I will tell God, “I’m making this for you! Did you know
that?” Since I don’t want it to rain on the altar, I will build up some sides,
put a roof over it held up by arches (God likes high roofs and arches) and it
is looking great. “But God I want you to see out, so I’ll have you look out at
the world through nice colorful stained glass windows so you’ll not get too
offended over what is going on. I’m going to also put up a lot of pictures of
you and Jesus Christ so you can look at yourself in the mirror.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Then I have “God’s house” completed with beautiful pews
with comfortable pads on them and beautiful red carpeted aisles. This is
cultured and pleasing. But I keep the key of my church to myself.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>So I have a big wing-ding week. Then suddenly late
Saturday night I say, “Wife, let’s go to church tomorrow morning. We’re going
to have to nod to God, we’ve been neglecting Him lately. Let’s go and pay our
respects to Him.” She says, “OK,” so we finally get up in the morning, pull
ourselves together, and look as respectable as possible. I unlock the door of
“God’s house” and walk in and say, “Hi, God, it is good to see you. Haven’t had
much to do with you all week, but wanted you to know that the interest is still
there.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Oh, by the way, God, we’d like to give you some money,”
and so I kick a little tip into the kitty and think, “Now that will help you
get through the week God.” Then the wife and I sit back and hear a nice talk on
how good we are. In all those beautiful surroundings, I get the feeling that
somehow God must overlook some of my naughtiness and neglect and that I must be
pleasing Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Finally, the talk is over and as we file out the door I
really feel inspired but also glad it is over for another week. After everyone
has cleared out, I slam the door, lock it, and say, “I’m sure glad that is over
for another week. Bye, God, I’ve given you my due. Now please, God, will you
keep your nose out of my business? Kindly look the other way. How about it? OK?
It’s a bargain.” You can apply this illustration any way you want. Some will
surely get the point of playing church.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Gentiles Are Under Sin</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 1:3-4, Paul is introducing Jesus Christ to the
Gentiles in Rome. In Romans 1:11-13, he is relating his desire to come to teach
them even earlier for their spiritual edification.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;concerning His Son, who was born of a descendant of David
according to the flesh, who was declared the Son of God with power by the
resurrection from the dead, according to the Spirit of holiness, Jesus Christ
our Lord,&quot;  (Romans 1:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For I long to see you so that I may impart some spiritual
gift to you, that you may be established; that is, that I may be encouraged
together with you while among you, each of us by the other's faith, both yours
and mine. I do not want you to be unaware, brethren, that often I have planned
to come to you (and have been prevented so far) so that I may obtain some fruit
among you also, even as among the rest of the Gentiles.&quot;  (Romans 1:11-13,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul states that “I am a debtor, I am ready, and I am not
ashamed.” This all involves the preaching of the Gospel. Paul was not ashamed
of the Gospel because it was good news. It is the power of God unto salvation
to everyone that believers. Rom. 1:14-16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians,
both to the wise and to the foolish. So, for my part, I am eager to preach the
gospel to you also who are in Rome. For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it
is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first
and also to the Greek.&quot;  (Romans 1:14-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As an illustration, let’s say that you go into a car
dealer to buy a Zilch V-8. As you approach the salesman and inquire about the
car, he tells you that the previous three that he sold were wrecked because the
steering wheel came off. Furthermore, their ignition systems were catching fire
and causing considerable damage. The fenders were also falling off. Would you
buy the car? Most wouldn’t if they were thinking. You would want a car that was
good news, not bad from day one. So it is with the Gospel. It is nothing but
good news. It is not good news that I am a sinner, but good news that Jesus
Christ died for my sins and can save me eternally. So don’t be afraid of the
Gospel. It is good news and open to all, good or bad.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers are saved only by faith. This is the first
instance of “faith” in Romans 1:17. They are to live by faith which is the
second instance of the word “faith.” God never says to stop believing. We
believed the promise of salvation by faith and were saved. We are to continue
to believe the promises of God by faith after salvation so we can grow
spiritually. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith
to faith; as it is written, &quot;BUT THE RIGHTEOUS man SHALL LIVE BY
FAITH.&quot;&quot;  (Romans 1:17, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><a name="_Jews_Under_Sin"></a><b>Jews Are Under Sin</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul addresses a group of Jews who have been sitting in
judgment on the Gentile group that Paul has just blistered. Can’t you just hear
those Jews after Romans 1? “That’s right, Paul, really give it to them! They
deserve it, those Gentile dogs. Sic ‘em, Paul, really lay it on!” But Paul
turns right around and lowers the boom on the Jews! “All right, you Jews, I
have a double barreled shotgun, the Gentiles got one barrel of the gun, now
I’ll unload the other in your camp!” And he did! Rom. 2:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore you have no excuse, everyone of you who passes
judgment, for in that which you judge another, you condemn yourself; for you
who judge practice the same things. And we know that the judgment of God
rightly falls upon those who practice such things.&quot;  (Romans 2:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What did the Gentiles do that caused the Holy Spirit to
inspire Paul to write a sordid story like Romans 1? They suppressed truth. What
did the Jews do? They rejected the light they had. Who had more light? Jews had
more light to suppress and the more light, the more judgment. Certainly, the
Gentiles needed to be judged for their wicked deeds, but the Jews would be too,
for they did the same things. That is, the Gentiles immorally suppress truth
and the Jews religiously suppress truth. Rom. 2:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But do you suppose this, O man, when you pass judgment on
those who practice such things and do the same yourself, that you will escape
the judgment of God?&quot;  (Romans 2:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Jews hadn’t lived up to the light in the Old
Testament. Here was the Jew with the Old Testament promises to Abraham. Why, we
are God’s chosen people! So, was the Jew automatically in because of
nationality, because of papa Abraham, father of the Israelite nation? Of course
not! </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They were saying, “Abraham was a Christian, therefore I’m
a Christian. That is like saying Martin Luther was a Christian. I’m a Lutheran,
therefore, I’m a Christian. Or John Wesley was a Christian. I’m a Methodist,
therefore, I’m a Christian. Or John Knox was a Christian. I’m a Presbyterian,
therefore, I’m a Christian. Or, I’m a Jew, therefore, I’m in God’s favor by all
means! I was raised in a Christian home, therefore, St. Peter is going to be
impressed with me at the pearly gates. No, a thousand times no!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They were also saying in Romans 2:5 that because they
were Jews they were not subject to judgment as the Gentiles. But Paul cuts them
down to size. Listen, some people today think that because they are Methodists
or Baptists or Bereans or something else, that it gets them into heaven. Or
that being a Catholic gets them past St. Peter. God is not impressed with your
brand or label. He wants to know, what you have done with the truth? That truth
is, Jesus Christ died for your sins! Simply believe in Him as your Savior. John
3:36.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But because of your stubbornness and unrepentant heart
you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath and revelation of the
righteous judgment of God,&quot;  (Romans 2:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he
who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on
him.&quot;&quot;  (John 3:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Where did the Jews learn about the longsuffering and
goodness of God? Through His mighty acts in the Old Testament. Did the Gentiles
have an Old Testament? No, the Jews were the custodians of the truth. Did the
Gentiles know about God’s longsuffering as did the Jews? No, the Gentiles were
seeing the wrath of God, the power of God, that there was a God and they could
see this apart from the Old Testament Scriptures. The Jews knew that God was
good and longsuffering, but they didn’t utilize His grace! Rom. 2:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Or do you think lightly of the riches of His kindness and
tolerance and patience, not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to
repentance?&quot;  (Romans 2:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing> “Wrath” is used in Romans 1:18. Is God righteous in
judging sin? Now let’s take this verse in context! Does this mean that here is
Mary Doe who is a good woman so she is going to heaven? Because she is so good?
Here is Sarah Mud. She is bad so she is going to hell because she is bad? No!
Put it in context, “according to his deeds.” What were their deeds? They
suppressed truth! Rom. 2:5; Rom. 2:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all
ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in
unrighteousness,&quot;  (Romans 1:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But because of your stubbornness and unrepentant heart
you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath and revelation of the
righteous judgment of God,&quot;  (Romans 2:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;who WILL RENDER TO EACH PERSON ACCORDING TO HIS
DEEDS:&quot;  (Romans 2:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Read Romans 2:7-9. In Romans 2:9, “who does evil” is again
holding down the truth, not responding to it. Why is the Jew mentioned first?
More light. By the way, do you realize the light you are getting through
studying this? More than the Jews ever had! We can use them and the Gentiles as
whipping boys. Be careful how you handle truth. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;to those who by perseverance in doing good seek for glory
and honor and immortality, eternal life; but to those who are selfishly
ambitious and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, wrath and
indignation. There will be tribulation and distress for every soul of man who
does evil, of the Jew first and also of the Greek,&quot;  (Romans 2:7-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In that case you may say, “I had better get out of here.”
Do you realize that the Bible indicates that we are also responsible for the
truth that we could have received? James 4:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore, to one who knows the right thing to do and
does not do it, to him it is sin.&quot;  (James 4:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Romans 2:11 says that there is no partiality with God.
This is a tremendous statement. Most of us are common ordinary people. We’re
not big shots. In the world today, it is not who you are, but who you know! An
illustration is that when we were in seminary, we had a neighbor who knew
nothing about electricity, but he knew a vice-president of a huge electrical
outfit and he was hired for a high-up job in that company. He knew the right
man and was hired even though others were more qualified. This is partiality. Rom.
2:10-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;but glory and honor and peace to everyone who does good,
to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For there is no partiality with
God.&quot;  (Romans 2:10-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>But with God, there is no partiality! It is not going to
be what kind of clothing you have or what side of the tracks you were born on,
or how much education you have, or your advantages or disadvantages. This shot
the Jews down for they were counting on some special treatment from the Lord.
They would say: “Why, I’m a Jew. I’m of the chosen race! I’ve got Abraham as my
father. Look at those Gentile dogs.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They believed that there had to be partiality with God
but there is not. None! We have the same thing today. “Oh God, I’m a Methodist,
I’m a Baptist, I’m a Congregationalist! I’m this or that. Are you impressed
God? See God, here is my baptismal certificate. Here’s when I joined the
church. God aren’t you impressed with me, don’t you know who I am?” Who sinned
without the Law? The Gentiles. Who sinned within the Law? The Jews did. Rom.
2:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For all who have sinned without the Law will also perish
without the Law, and all who have sinned under the Law will be judged by the
Law;&quot;  (Romans 2:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An illustration of Jews having the Mosaic Law: Let’s say
I come in to my house and I’m jumping two feet off the floor with excitement
and anticipation. I’ve got a document. I was going down the road and this black
car with a large taillight on the roof stopped me and gave me a document. It
says I am going to see the judge tomorrow! Oh boy, look what I’ve got. I am
proud of this. But what I’ve got is a ticket. And what does this document do?
It condemns me! It points out my violation, my sin!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>And the very Law that the Jews boasted about, condemned
them and called them sinners. But they said, “Look at this, the Law is
entrusted to us. You poor Gentiles, you outsiders.” But more light and more
judgment. Romans 2:13 looks like you can be saved by keeping the Law. Can you?
No! The Law has no power to save anyone. Keep it in context. The Law pointed
out sin. A person who does what the Law says, takes its message to heart. As a
sinner, I need a Savior. When I believe in Him, I am justified.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;for it is not the hearers of the Law who are just before
God, but the doers of the Law will be justified.&quot;  (Romans 2:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Churches are loaded with people who think they are
justified by the Law, the do-gooders. They teach Sunday school, sing in the
choir, pitch bills into the plate, and are religious to the gills. Down in
Texas, a fine man attended a Christian church. On the invitation of an
acquaintance, he went to a Bible class and was eventually saved. When he wrote
his resignation (he was on the board of elders) he said, “I’ve gone to church
the better part of my life, and had never been presented with the claims of
Jesus Christ.” Now, was he a bad man? No. He had been a good religious man
without Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Romans 2 is designed to bring good people under
conviction. The Gentiles had the law of conscience. Thus, they had the truth,
they were responsible even though they did not have the Law. Rom. 2:14-16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For when Gentiles who do not have the Law do
instinctively the things of the Law, these, not having the Law, are a law to
themselves, in that they show the work of the Law written in their hearts,
their conscience bearing witness and their thoughts alternately accusing or
else defending them, on the day when, according to my gospel, God will judge
the secrets of men through Christ Jesus.&quot;  (Romans 2:14-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul began to put on the heat. Note the sarcasm. “Why
don’t you practice what you preach, boys?” Rom. 2:17-20; Rom. 2:21-23.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But if you bear the name &quot;Jew&quot; and rely upon
the Law and boast in God, and know His will and approve the things that are
essential, being instructed out of the Law, and are confident that you yourself
are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness, a corrector of
the foolish, a teacher of the immature, having in the Law the embodiment of
knowledge and of the truth,&quot;  (Romans 2:17-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;you, therefore, who teach another, do you not teach
yourself? You who preach that one shall not steal, do you steal? You who say
that one should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor
idols, do you rob temples? You who boast in the Law, through your breaking the
Law, do you dishonor God?&quot;  (Romans 2:21-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They were dishonoring the name of God. They replied, “Oh
no, we honor it!” The Jews were actually blaspheming God in the presence of the
Gentile nations. They were not a testimony to the Gentiles in any way most of
the time. Rom. 2:24.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For &quot;THE NAME OF GOD IS BLASPHEMED AMONG THE
GENTILES BECAUSE OF YOU,&quot; just as it is written.&quot;  (Romans 2:24,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You know what the biggest enemy of witnessing is? It
isn’t the beer joints. It is converted Christians who are not walking in
fellowship. How does the outsider look at your church? Do they say, “If you
want the Bible explained, go to that church, it’s a really relaxed church and I
feel right at home there.” Or, “The people who go to that church go to learn
the Word and they sure put it to use when they get out.” Or, “If that is
Christianity, they can have it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Romans 2:25 is an illustration of blaspheming God.
Circumcision was a mark or outward sign of the Abrahamic Covenant, but it had
just come to mean a mark with no spiritual significance.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For indeed circumcision is of value if you practice the
Law; but if you are a transgressor of the Law, your circumcision has become
uncircumcision.&quot;  (Romans 2:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Water baptism, certainly taught in the Word of God, has
lost its significance in many places today. Biblically, it symbolizes the
mechanics by which we were placed into the Body of Christ. Water baptism has
nothing to do with salvation. It illustrates what happened at the point of
salvation when you were entered into union with Christ by the Holy Spirit.
Biblical water baptism always comes in order, after salvation. But in the
United States, a conversation can go like this; “Are you a Christian?” Reply;
“Well, I’ve been baptized and joined the church.” Those two factors never saved
anyone in the history of the human race according to the Bible.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There was a fellow in Iowa, a middle aged barber, a very
fine fellow. One day a Christian went into his shop to get clipped. The place
was empty and they started to talk about churches. The barber was asked
inoffensively if he were going to heaven. The fellow paused and said, “No, I
guess not.” He was asked why he wasn’t. He said, “Well, I lost my baptismal
certificate.” This man was serious. At some time in his life someone had
dropped a few drops of water on his head and had given him a certificate. He had
grabbed it and said, “Oh boy, now I’m going to heaven.” But alas, he had lost
his proof.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 2:26, the unbelieving Jew had made circumcision
just a rite. Ritual without reality is meaningless.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So if the uncircumcised man keeps the requirements of the
Law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?&quot;  (Romans
2:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What is needful? A change of heart. Inside information.
Obedience is better than ritual. Rom. 2:27-29.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And he who is physically uncircumcised, if he keeps the
Law, will he not judge you who though having the letter of the Law and
circumcision are a transgressor of the Law? For he is not a Jew who is one
outwardly, nor is circumcision that which is outward in the flesh. But he is a
Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that which is of the heart, by the
Spirit, not by the letter; and his praise is not from men, but from God.&quot; 
(Romans 2:27-29, NASB)</p>
