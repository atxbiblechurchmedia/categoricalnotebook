<h2><a name="_Isagogical_and_Doctrinal"></a>The Old Sin Nature</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The old sin nature is the internal source of temptation
to commit personal sins and depends on human good production to gain acceptance
from God. This always results in contributing to the evil of Satan’s world
system. The old sin nature is also the center of corruption and rebellion
against God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The old sin nature influences the soul resulting in mental
attitude sins and wrong motivation. The old sin nature is the dictator of the
soul. However, no one sins apart from their own free will.  Even if you don't
know it’s a sin, you wanted to do it and you do it, and so are responsible for
that sin. Anything coming out of this distorter is either human good, sin, or
evil. All are unacceptable to God. The old sin nature controls the believer’s
soul while out of fellowship and either produces human good from the area of
strength or sin from the area of weakness. This is also dependent upon the
individual’s old sin nature trend pattern.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All human beings except the humanity of Jesus Christ are
born with a genetically-formed old sin nature. The old sin nature is
perpetuated in the human race through physical birth and is physically present
in every cell of the body as long as you live on this earth. 1 Tim. 2:13-14;
Rom. 5:12. See category on <a href="#_Jesus_Christ’s_Virgin">Jesus Christ’s
Virgin Birth</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For it was Adam who was first created, and then Eve. And it
was not Adam who was deceived, but the woman being deceived, fell into
transgression.” (1 Timothy 2:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world,
and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned—”
(Romans 5:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 51:5, “in sin” means with a sin nature. Ephesians
2:1 indicates we are born spiritually dead with an old sin nature.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, And in sin my mother
conceived me.” (Psalms 51:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And you were dead in your trespasses and sins,” (Ephesians
2:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The old sin nature is completely deceitful and desperately
sick. In Jeremiah 17:9, “heart” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>לב</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>(lêb) in the Hebrew and refers here to the right lobe of the soul being
tempted by the old sin nature and due to negative volition, the person deciding
to sin whereby the old sin nature gains complete control of the soul. Mark
7:21-23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;The heart is more deceitful than all else And is
desperately sick; Who can understand it?” (Jeremiah 17:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed the
evil thoughts, fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries, deeds of coveting and
wickedness, as well as deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride and
foolishness. &quot;All these evil things proceed from within and defile the
man.&quot;” (Mark 7:21-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The old sin nature is located in every cell of your body.
It brings temptation into your thinking in the right lobe of the soul. While
most temptation comes this way to our soul, outside sources of overt temptation
also exist. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sin is defined in the right lobe of the soul before your
volition or free will decides to either go with the temptation and sin or to
resist and not commit the sin. All sin originates from your volition, not the
old sin nature. The old sin nature brings temptation to your soul where you
exercise free will to sin or not. Temptation or being tempted is not sinning.
Your volition must decide to give in to the temptation before it can become a
sin. All people, believers and unbelievers alike, are held accountable for
their sins before God. Rom. 7:14; 1 John 1:8; 1 John 1:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For we know that the Law is spiritual, but I am of flesh, sold
into bondage to sin.” (Romans 7:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves and
the truth is not in us.” (1 John 1:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar and His
word is not in us.” (1 John 1:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The old sin nature tempts us to commit sin, perform human
good and do evil, but our free will is the source of our sins. The old sin
nature cannot do anything without our volition. Whether we are aware we are
sinning or we are ignorant, our volition still commits every sin. Ignorance is
no excuse.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The old sin nature will not be present in the believer’s
resurrection body nor in their interim body. The believer’s interim body is
that received following physical death in heaven, but prior to the Rapture of
the Church. Receipt of a resurrection body at the Rapture of the Church is
called ultimate sanctification where the old sin nature, human good and evil
will have been removed. Rom. 8:29; 1 Thess. 5:23; 1 John 3:1-2; Phil. 3:21; 1
Cor. 15:51-52.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become
conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many
brethren;” (Romans 8:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you entirely; and
may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame at the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.” (1 Thessalonians 5:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“See how great a love the Father has bestowed on us, that we
would be called children of God; and such we are. For this reason the world
does not know us, because it did not know Him. Beloved, now we are children of
God, and it has not appeared as yet what we will be. We know that when He
appears, we will be like Him, because we will see Him just as He is.” (1 John
3:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“who will transform the body of our humble state into
conformity with the body of His glory, by the exertion of the power that He has
even to subject all things to Himself.” (Philippians 3:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Behold, I tell you a mystery; we will not all sleep, but we
will all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last
trumpet; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable,
and we will be changed.” (1 Corinthians 15:51-52, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Origin of the Sin Nature</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Negative volition created the old sin nature. Adam and
Eve could not sin until they first exercised negative volition. Upon the
exercise of their negative volition to the single prohibition of God in the
Garden, the first man and woman died spiritually and became sinners. Since all
reproduction is “after its kind,” all who are descended from Adam have
inherited his nature, which is sinful. No volition is involved in acquiring an
old sin nature. Gen. 5:3; Rom. 5:12. </p>

<p class=Verses>“When Adam had lived one hundred and thirty years, he became
the father of a son in his own likeness, according to his image, and named him
Seth.” (Genesis 5:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world,
and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned—”
(Romans 5:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our genetically-formed old sin nature is the target for
the imputation of Adam’s original sin at our physical birth causing spiritual
death. Spiritual death is separation from God. At the moment we are physically
born, God the Father imputes or conveys soul life to our bodies when we take
our first breath. At birth, we have both human life and soul life. Only God can
create human life. At the moment of birth, the justice of God also imputes
Adam’s original sin to our genetically-formed old sin nature that resides in
every cell of the body. This results in human life and soul life, but also
spiritual death.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Inheritance of the Old Sin Nature </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Everyone born in the human race, except the humanity of
Jesus Christ, has an old sin nature. The old sin nature is passed down
genetically through the male. We all inherit the old sin nature from our
fathers because Adam knowingly committed his first sin, but Eve was deceived
when she committed her first sin. The woman was deceived by the serpent (Satan)
and committed the first sin. She immediately acquired an old sin nature. Adam
sinned second and deliberately and also immediately acquired an old sin nature.
Both were guilty before God. 1 Tim. 2:14; Rom. 5:12; Psalms 51:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And it was not Adam who was deceived, but the woman being
deceived, fell into transgression.” (1 Timothy 2:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world,
and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned—”
(Romans 5:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, And in sin my mother
conceived me.” (Psalms 51:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The entire human race is counted guilty before God because
Adam sinned. Everyone sinned when Adam sinned (retroactive). When Adam was
condemned, Adam’s progeny were also condemned. So by one man (Jesus Christ)
salvation came to mankind. 1 Cor. 15:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made
alive.” (1 Corinthians 15:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The judgment of the woman was two-fold. God's judgment
involved painful childbirth and a desire (strong craving) for her husband, but her
husband would have authority over her. This would be the means of the bearing
one particular child through the Virgin Birth. The woman would be the means of
bringing the humanity of Christ into the world. He is the Savior and through
this One, all the sins of the whole world were atoned. Only through
childbearing could the Son of God come into the world as Savior, as the God-man.
Gen. 3:16; 2 Cor. 5:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“To the woman He said, &quot;I will greatly multiply Your pain
in childbirth, In pain you will bring forth children; Yet your desire will be
for your husband, And he will rule over you.&quot;” (Genesis 3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that
we might become the righteousness of God in Him.” (2 Corinthians 5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The judgment of the man is found in Genesis 3:17-19. Man
must earn his living by the sweat of his face. Because the Adam sinned willfully,
he became the means of passing on the genetically-formed old sin nature. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then to Adam He said, &quot;Because you have listened to the
voice of your wife, and have eaten from the tree about which I commanded you,
saying, 'You shall not eat from it'; Cursed is the ground because of you; In
toil you will eat of it All the days of your life. &quot;Both thorns and
thistles it shall grow for you; And you will eat the plants of the field; By
the sweat of your face You will eat bread, Till you return to the ground,
Because from it you were taken; For you are dust, And to dust you shall
return.&quot;” (Genesis 3:17-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are three types of sin; imputed sin resulting in spiritual
death, inherent sin or the old sin nature, and personal sin which is the manifestation
of having an old sin nature. In the conception of the humanity of Jesus Christ,
the woman participated, but the man (Joseph) did not participate. Therefore,
Jesus Christ was born without a sin nature. Matt. 1:20. See category on <a
href="#_Jesus_Christ’s_Virgin">Jesus Christ’s Virgin Birth</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But when he had considered this, behold, an angel of the Lord
appeared to him in a dream, saying, &quot;Joseph, son of David, do not be
afraid to take Mary as your wife; for the Child who has been conceived in her
is of the Holy Spirit.” (Matthew 1:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Structure of the Old Sin Nature</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The old sin nature has an essence with different facets
or characteristics. In Romans 6:6, “our old self” refers to the old sin nature
that is located genetically in every cell of our body or “our body of sin.” We
as Church Age believers are now in union with Jesus Christ and through the
filling of the Holy Spirit we do not serve the old sin nature and are no longer
slaves to it. When we sin, we again serve the old sin nature until we confess
our known sins to God the Father and are restored to fellowship with God though
the filling of the Holy Spirit. 1 John 1:9. </p>

<p class=Verses>“knowing this, that our old self was crucified with Him, in
order that our body of sin might be done away with, so that we would no longer
be slaves to sin;” (Romans 6:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God says that everything produced when our soul is
controlled by the old sin nature is unacceptable, according to the absolute standard
of His perfect righteousness. Rom. 7:18; Rom. 8:7-8; Isaiah 64:6. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my
flesh; for the willing is present in me, but the doing of the good is not.”
(Romans 7:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“because the mind set on the flesh is hostile toward God; for
it does not subject itself to the law of God, for it is not even able to do so,
and those who are in the flesh cannot please God.” (Romans 8:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For all of us have become like one who is unclean, And all our
righteous deeds are like a filthy garment; And all of us wither like a leaf,
And our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.” (Isaiah 64:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When we give in to the old sin nature’s area of strength,
we produce human good. This is predominant when the person’s trend is toward legalism
and self-righteous arrogance. Isaiah 64:6; Heb. 6:1; Rom. 8:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For all of us have become like one who is unclean, And all our
righteous deeds are like a filthy garment; And all of us wither like a leaf,
And our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.” (Isaiah 64:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore leaving the elementary teaching about the Christ,
let us press on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from
dead works and of faith toward God,” (Hebrews 6:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and those who are in the flesh cannot please God.” (Romans
8:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When we give in to the old sin nature’s area of weakness
which is the source of temptation, we commit personal sins and evil. This is
predominant when the person’s trend is toward antinomianism, lasciviousness and
lawlessness. Gal. 5:9-10; Rom. 3:23; Mark 7:21-23; Heb. 12:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“A little leaven leavens the whole lump of dough. I have
confidence in you in the Lord that you will adopt no other view; but the one
who is disturbing you will bear his judgment, whoever he is.” (Galatians
5:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,”
(Romans 3:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed the
evil thoughts, fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries, deeds of coveting and
wickedness, as well as deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride and
foolishness. &quot;All these evil things proceed from within and defile the
man.&quot;” (Mark 7:21-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses
surrounding us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so
easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before
us,” (Hebrews 12:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses><img border=0 width=500 height=420 id="Picture 1"
src="The%20Old%20Sin%20Nature.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The old sin nature has a trend toward legalism which is
self-righteousness and is a trend toward religion, the law keeper for
salvation. Some legalists believe that you cannot commit certain sins and still
be a believer. Legalism is acting religious and putting on a good front. These
are often very “respectable, clean-cut types.” This trend can lead to moral
degeneracy. 2 Cor. 11:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising
themselves as apostles of Christ.” (2 Corinthians 11:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The old sin nature also has another trend toward
Antinomianism which is licentiousness, a trend toward being lawless or
irreligious. Antinomianism is any view which rejects laws or legalism and
argues against moral, religious or social norms and involves overt sinning,
irreligious behavior, criminality, and whose life centers around sin and evil.
These people don’t care who knows how he or she lives. This can lead to immoral
degeneracy. Gal. 5:19-21; 1 Cor. 6:9-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are: immorality,
impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts
of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions, envying, drunkenness, carousing, and
things like these, of which I forewarn you, just as I have forewarned you, that
those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.” (Galatians
5:19-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the
kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor
adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor
drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, will inherit the kingdom of God.” (1
Corinthians 6:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The old sin nature also has lust patterns toward
legitimate or illegitimate pursuits. This is the motivator of the old sin
nature involving sinful desires, approbation lust, power lust, materialism
lust, sexual lust, etc. The lust pattern also has a “good” desire or a pattern
involving what a person likes to do such as a collector, hunter, or automobile
enthusiast, etc. Rom. 7:7; Rom. 13:14; Rom. 6:12-13; James 4:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“What shall we say then? Is the Law sin? May it never be! On
the contrary, I would not have come to know sin except through the Law; for I
would not have known about coveting if the Law had not said, &quot;YOU SHALL
NOT COVET.&quot;” (Romans 7:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for
the flesh in regard to its lusts.” (Romans 13:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you
obey its lusts, and do not go on presenting the members of your body to sin as
instruments of unrighteousness; but present yourselves to God as those alive
from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.”
(Romans 6:12-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Or do you think that the Scripture speaks to no purpose:
&quot;He jealously desires the Spirit which He has made to dwell in us&quot;?”
(James 4:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Approbation lust is doing something for the applause or
praise received. Power lust is the desire to be the best in everything and have
control over others. Materialism lust is the desire to keep ahead of the “Joneses”
or strive for security in the financial realm. Whether one has much or little
is not the issue. Ego lust is pride. The more the ego is developed, the more
people pat us on the back, the more dependent we become on flattery,
recognition, and approbation. Sexual lust is the bodily desire stemming from a
mental attitude.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our divine good productivity as believers is dependent
entirely upon facing ourselves as we really are and orienting to God's grace.
We are nothing because of our old sin nature. The believer who is dependent
upon the feeding of ego lust for productivity is not producing at all.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Old Sin Nature Terms</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are terms used in Scripture to describe the old sin
nature - sin, the flesh, old self - old man, heart, carnality – of flesh,
corruptible man, and perishable seed. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Sin</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sin in the singular generally refers to the sin nature.
In the plural, sin generally refers to personal sins. In Romans 5:12, “sin” is <span
lang=EL>α</span>̔<span lang=EL>μαρτι</span>́<span lang=EL>α</span> (hamartia)
and refers to the old sin nature. In Psalms 51:5, “in sin” is <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>חטא</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(chêṭ') and refers also to the old sin
nature.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world,
and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned—”
(Romans 5:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, And in sin my mother
conceived me.” (Psalms 51:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 7:14, “sold into bondage to sin” refers to
carnality where the old sin nature controls the soul. In 1 John 1:8, “no sin”
refers to the old sin nature. In Romans 6:1, “continue in sin” refers to the old
sin nature’s reign or control of the soul. 1 John 1:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For we know that the Law is spiritual, but I am of flesh, sold
into bondage to sin.” (Romans 7:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves and
the truth is not in us.” (1 John 1:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin so that
grace may increase?” (Romans 6:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Flesh</u> </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The term “flesh” or <span lang=EL>σα</span>́<span
lang=EL>ρξ</span> (sarx) in the Greek puts emphasis on location of the old sin
nature in the cell structure of the body and refers to the power of the old sin
nature. Rom. 8:8;Rom. 7:18; Gal. 5:16-17; Eph. 2:3; Rom. 13:14; Gal. 3:3; John
3:6. </p>

<p class=Verses>“and those who are in the flesh cannot please God.” (Romans
8:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my
flesh; for the willing is present in me, but the doing of the good is not.”
(Romans 7:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the
desire of the flesh. For the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit, and the
Spirit against the flesh; for these are in opposition to one another, so that
you may not do the things that you please.” (Galatians 5:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Among them we too all formerly lived in the lusts of our
flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature
children of wrath, even as the rest.” (Ephesians 2:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for
the flesh in regard to its lusts.” (Romans 13:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now
being perfected by the flesh?” (Galatians 3:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which
is born of the Spirit is spirit.” (John 3:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Old Self - Old Man</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The old sin nature is called “old self” or <span lang=EL>παλαιο</span>́<span
lang=EL>ς</span><span lang=EL> </span><span lang=EL>α</span>̓́<span lang=EL>νθρωπος</span>
(palaios anthrōpos) in the Greek  (“old man” in the KJV) because it is as old
as Adam’s negative volition in the Garden of Eden. Rom. 6:6; Eph. 4:22; Col.
3:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do not lie to one another, since you laid aside the old self
with its evil practices,” (Colossians 3:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“that, in reference to your former manner of life, you lay
aside the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of
deceit,” (Ephesians 4:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“knowing this, that our old self was crucified with Him, in
order that our body of sin might be done away with, so that we would no longer
be slaves to sin;” (Romans 6:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Heart</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scripture also describes sin, good or evil as coming from
the “heart.”  In these verses, the heart refers to the right lobe of the soul
that is under temptation from the old sin nature. The old sin nature brings
temptation into the thinking of the person’s right lobe. The person then has a
choice or volition to either act on the temptation and sin against God or to
resist the temptation and avoid sinning. The old sin nature’s influence can
also result in the person producing human good or evil. Jer. 17:9; Matt.
12:34-35; Matt. 15:19; Mark 7:21-23; Psalms 58:2-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;The heart is more deceitful than all else And is
desperately sick; Who can understand it?” (Jeremiah 17:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You brood of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak what
is good? For the mouth speaks out of that which fills the heart. &quot;The good
man brings out of his good treasure what is good; and the evil man brings out
of his evil treasure what is evil.” (Matthew 12:34-35, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders,
adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, slanders.” (Matthew 15:19,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed the
evil thoughts, fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries, deeds of coveting and
wickedness, as well as deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride and
foolishness. &quot;All these evil things proceed from within and defile the
man.&quot;” (Mark 7:21-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“No, in heart you work unrighteousness; On earth you weigh out
the violence of your hands. The wicked are estranged from the womb; These who
speak lies go astray from birth. They have venom like the venom of a serpent;
Like a deaf cobra that stops up its ear, So that it does not hear the voice of
charmers, Or a skillful caster of spells.” (Psalms 58:2-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Carnality - of Flesh</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 7:14 and 1 Corinthians 3:1-3, “carnality” in
the KJV and “of flesh” in the NASB is <span lang=EL>σα</span>́<span lang=EL>ρκινος</span>
(sarkinos) and refers to the soul being controlled by the old sin nature and
therefore, in a state of sin. In 1 Corinthians 3:3, “are you not walking like
mere men” means that in this state of carnality, the believer cannot be
distinguished from the unbeliever.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For we know that the Law is spiritual, but I am of flesh, sold
into bondage to sin.” (Romans 7:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual men,
but as to men of flesh, as to infants in Christ. I gave you milk to drink, not
solid food; for you were not yet able to receive it. Indeed, even now you are
not yet able, for you are still fleshly. For since there is jealousy and strife
among you, are you not fleshly, and are you not walking like mere men?” (1
Corinthians 3:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 8:6-8, “mind set on the flesh” (“the carnal
mind” in the KJV) is the mind under the control of the old sin nature. “Death”
refers to temporal death or control of the soul by the old sin nature. Only
confession of known sins to God the Father via 1 John 1:9 can recover the
soul’s control by the Holy Spirit. </p>

<p class=Verses>“because the mind set on the flesh is hostile toward God; for
it does not subject itself to the law of God, for it is not even able to do
so,” (Romans 8:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on
the Spirit is life and peace, because the mind set on the flesh is hostile
toward God; for it does not subject itself to the law of God, for it is not
even able to do so, and those who are in the flesh cannot please God.” (Romans
8:6-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Corruptible Man</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 1:23, “corruptible man” refers to the old sin
nature which corrupts mankind physically, spiritually, and morally.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image
in the form of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed animals and
crawling creatures.” (Romans 1:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Perishable Seed</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Peter 1:23, “seed which is perishable” refers to the
transmission of the old sin nature.</p>

<p class=Verses>“for you have been born again not of seed which is perishable
but imperishable, that is, through the living and enduring word of God.” (1
Peter 1:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Believer’s Struggle With the Old Sin Nature </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The old sin nature continues to be a significant
influence on the believer’s volition after salvation in spite of every believer
being placed into union with Jesus Christ. The consistent intake and
application of Bible doctrine in the spiritual life is necessary to grow
spiritually and thereby gain more resistance over the influence of the old sin
nature. As the believer learns more <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine, they spend
more time filled with the Holy Spirit and less time with the old sin nature
controlling their soul. There is a constant battle for control of the
believer’s soul. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers continue to use their volition to make
decisions and also continue to possess their old sin natures after salvation. 1
John 1:8; 1 John 1:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves and
the truth is not in us.” (1 John 1:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar and His
word is not in us.” (1 John 1:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Being tempted by the old sin nature is not sinning.
Choosing to follow the temptations of the old sin nature is either sinning,
evil, or human good. Only confession of known sins to God the Father in prayer
results in the filling of the Holy Spirit and the control of the soul shifting
from the old sin nature to the Holy Spirit’s control.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our volition has a positive and negative pole. Our
volition makes decisions based on internal temptations from our old sin nature,
which has areas of strength and weakness and a tendency toward asceticism or
lasciviousness. Sin and evil are produced by the believer’s volition based on
temptation from the old sin nature area of weakness and are predominant when
there is a tendency toward lasciviousness. Human good can be produced by the
believer’s volition based on temptation from the old sin nature area of strength
and from its tendency toward asceticism.  Rom. 6.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Nothing produced by the believer is acceptable to God
when their soul controlled by the old sin nature. Jesus Christ bore all of the
sins of mankind on the Cross, but rejected all human good produced by the believer.
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer out of fellowship with God means their soul
is under the control of the old sin nature is called a carnal Christian. Carnal
believers have no bona fide divine good production in  the spiritual life
because they are not filled with the Holy Spirit. 1 Cor. 3:1-3; Rom. 7:14-15; Gal.
5:17; Matt. 12:34-35.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual men,
but as to men of flesh, as to infants in Christ. I gave you milk to drink, not
solid food; for you were not yet able to receive it. Indeed, even now you are
not yet able, for you are still fleshly. For since there is jealousy and strife
among you, are you not fleshly, and are you not walking like mere men?” (1
Corinthians 3:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For we know that the Law is spiritual, but I am of flesh, sold
into bondage to sin. For what I am doing, I do not understand; for I am not
practicing what I would like to do, but I am doing the very thing I hate.”
(Romans 7:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit, and the
Spirit against the flesh; for these are in opposition to one another, so that
you may not do the things that you please.” (Galatians 5:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You brood of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak what
is good? For the mouth speaks out of that which fills the heart. &quot;The good
man brings out of his good treasure what is good; and the evil man brings out
of his evil treasure what is evil.” (Matthew 12:34-35, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Because of regeneration, we are new creatures in Christ
and are expected to “walk in newness of life.” We have a permanent relationship
with Jesus Christ because we were placed into permanent union with Jesus Christ
at salvation (Baptism of the Spirit) so we should also walk in fellowship being
filled with the Holy Spirit. 2 Cor. 5:17; Rom. 6:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creature; the
old things passed away; behold, new things have come.” (2 Corinthians 5:17,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore we have been buried with Him through baptism into
death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the
Father, so we too might walk in newness of life.” (Romans 6:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The only solution to the sin nature controlling the
believer’s soul is the filling of the Holy Spirit appropriated through the
believer’s application of 1 John 1:9 followed by the daily intake and
application of the Word. This continues to give the proper fueling and mental
attitude necessary for spiritual growth. Gal. 5:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the
desire of the flesh.” (Galatians 5:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the believer, sometimes the conscience struggles to do
right, but since the old sin nature rules, it isn’t much of a struggle. There
is an inner conflict in the believer (not found in the unbeliever) between the
old sin nature and God the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit will not rule jointly
with the old sin nature. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Romans 7:14-15 is written from the viewpoint of the
carnal believer who doesn’t understand how to be filled with the Spirit. What
Romans 7:15 really saying is, “For what I am doing (that which works out of me)
I do not understand; for I am not practicing what I would like to do (I keep on
desiring to honor the Lord and practice spirituality), but I am doing the very
thing I hate (I keep on doing what I hate to do - sin and remain in
carnality).” </p>

<p class=Verses>“For we know that the Law is spiritual, but I am of flesh, sold
into bondage to sin. For what I am doing, I do not understand; for I am not
practicing what I would like to do, but I am doing the very thing I hate.”
(Romans 7:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers agree with the Mosaic Law when they recognize
that what they are doing is sin as defined in the Law. When the old sin nature
is in control, there is a zig-zag pattern within the old sin nature, between
the area of weakness and the area of strength. In Romans 7:16, “if” is a first
class condition in the Greek and means if and it is true. “The very thing I do”
means I keep on doing it.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“But if I do the very thing I do not want to do, I agree with
the Law, confessing that the Law is good.” (Romans 7:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You are not always going to move in the same direction.
The longer you stay out of fellowship, the more you will zig-zag. If you get
bored with self-righteousness, you will go toward lasciviousness and you will
live it up. Then you will get a guilty feeling and go back to asceticism and
put on a good front. When the Holy Spirit controls the believer’s soul, the
Holy Spirit produces the character of the incarnate Christ in the believer. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Old Sin Nature and the Unbeliever</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If you are not a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ, your
old sin nature rules your life, producing only sin, evil, and human good. The only
solution to the old sin nature’s complete domination of the soul is salvation
in Jesus Christ as Savior. The Lord Jesus Christ bore the sins of all mankind
on the Cross and rejected the production of human good. 1 Peter 2:24; Eph.
2:8-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, so that
we might die to sin and live to righteousness; for by His wounds you were
healed.” (1 Peter 2:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not
of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one
may boast.” (Ephesians 2:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sins committed prior to salvation are removed or “wiped
out” by personal faith in the work of Jesus Christ on the Cross for all sins.  Col.
1:14; Isaiah 43:25.</p>

<p class=Verses>“in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.”
(Colossians 1:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I, even I, am the one who wipes out your transgressions
for My own sake, And I will not remember your sins.” (Isaiah 43:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The unlimited atonement of Jesus Christ on the Cross paid
the penalty for all of the sins of all mankind - believer and unbeliever alike.
All human good performed by unbelievers and by believers out of fellowship (in
the energy of the flesh) is completely rejected by God because it was all produced
by human abilities while the old sin nature controlled the soul. Human good
production is contrary of God's grace. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>While the human race looks at the outside, but God looks at
what is in your soul. For the unbeliever, God sees only sin, evil, and human
good and cannot have association with any of it. His perfect righteousness
rejects all of it. Therefore, His justice must judge all of it. Rom. 8:8; Jer.
13:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and those who are in the flesh cannot please God.” (Romans
8:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Can the Ethiopian change his skin Or the leopard his
spots? Then you also can do good Who are accustomed to doing evil.” (Jeremiah
13:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Unbelievers will be judged by Jesus Christ for their good
deeds at the Great White Throne Judgment. Because of their rejection of the
atoning work of Jesus Christ in the Cross for their sins (the unpardonable sin),
unbelievers will stand on their own human good production, their good deeds and
great achievements which will not measure up to God’s perfect righteousness.
Rev. 20:11-15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat upon it, from
whose presence earth and heaven fled away, and no place was found for them. And
I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books
were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life; and the
dead were judged from the things which were written in the books, according to
their deeds. And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and Hades
gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged, every one of them
according to their deeds. Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of
fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire.” (Revelation 20:11-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The unbeliever’s sins will never be mentioned because
they have already been judged in Christ. Because of their unbelief and rejection
of Jesus Christ, all unbelievers will be cast into the Lake of Fire for
eternity with their worthless human good. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Old Sin Nature and the Believer</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every individual has volition, with a positive and
negative pole, which acts upon their old sin nature. As a believer, you can
choose whether or not the old sin nature controls your life. The believer under
the control of the old sin nature generally goes in one of two ways - lasciviousness
with evil actions or asceticism by putting on a good front. You cannot change
the old sin nature. Jer. 13:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Can the Ethiopian change his skin Or the leopard his
spots? Then you also can do good Who are accustomed to doing evil.” (Jeremiah
13:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The sins of the believer were borne by Jesus Christ on
the Cross. The Lord Jesus Christ died not only for our sins, but to unchain us
from the power of the old sin nature. 1 Peter 2:24; 2 Cor. 5:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, so that
we might die to sin and live to righteousness; for by His wounds you were
healed.” (1 Peter 2:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that
we might become the righteousness of God in Him.” (2 Corinthians 5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When believers sin, they must confess their known sins to
God the Father and thereby be returned to fellowship with God with their soul
again under the control of the Holy Spirit. Thus, we don’t have to serve the
sin nature any longer. We can claim God’s promise that we are dead to the old
sin nature and alive unto God. 1 John 1:9; Rom. 6:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Even so consider yourselves to be dead to sin, but alive to
God in Christ Jesus.” (Romans 6:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is the mental attitude when in fellowship. One moves
from being out of fellowship to being in fellowship by non-meritorious faith. Our
negative volition allows our old sin nature to rule our soul. When our volition
decides to go with the temptations of the old sin nature, then we immediately
lose the filling of the Holy Spirit and the old sin nature takes control of our
soul. The old sin nature does not do the sinning! We do by our giving in to the
old sin nature’s temptations through negative volition. This includes sins of
ignorance and deliberate sinning. We can also use our volition to put the old
sin nature out of control and let the Holy Spirit rule by use of 1 John 1:9.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When your soul is controlled by your old sin nature, you can
only produce human good. You may be nice and that is fine and do something nice
for others and that is fine, but if done when your soul is controlled by the
old sin nature (carnality), it can only be human good. Anything done when out
of fellowship is human good, sin or evil. Even if you were not aware that you
were in a state of sin. God condemns all human good production whether
well-intended or not. Jer. 17:9. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;The heart is more deceitful than all else And is
desperately sick; Who can understand it?” (Jeremiah 17:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ rejected all human good produced by either
unbeliever or the believer out of fellowship because it is all produce in the
energy of the flesh, by man’s abilities without use of God's grace resources.
Therefore it is unacceptable to God. Human good is contrary to the principle of
grace. In grace, God does the doing through the enabling power of the Holy
Spirit whereby <i>gnosis</i> (knowledge) is changed to <i>epignosis</i> (full
knowledge) because of the believer’s faith acceptance of the Bible doctrine
taught. The accumulated <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the right lobe of
the soul causes the erection of the edification complex of the soul. By this, God
is glorified. Man does the receiving. Eph. 2:8-9; Rom. 8:8. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not
of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one
may boast.” (Ephesians 2:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and those who are in the flesh cannot please God.” (Romans
8:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In legalism, man does the doing by producing human good
and man gets the glory. Before human good is judged, human good was rejected. Human
good is produced by the believer because their soul was controlled by the old
sin nature when doing so. All human good will be judged at the Judgment Seat of
Christ. Human good is wood, hay, and straw and is unacceptable to God who will
burn it. 1 Cor. 3:10-15. See category on <a href="#_D-Human_Good">Human Good</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“According to the grace of God which was given to me, like a
wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another is building on it. But
each man must be careful how he builds on it. For no man can lay a foundation
other than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. Now if any man builds
on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, each
man's work will become evident; for the day will show it because it is to be
revealed with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of each man's
work. If any man's work which he has built on it remains, he will receive a
reward. If any man's work is burned up, he will suffer loss; but he himself
will be saved, yet so as through fire.” (1 Corinthians 3:10-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Saul’s Old Sin Nature </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Saul was a believer in the Old Testament who let his sin
nature control him. His sin nature had a trend toward lasciviousness and evil.
He acted from his area of weakness. Saul could have been Israel’s greatest king
because he was chosen by God Himself. The Holy Spirit came to endue him to give
him divine power to be all that God wanted him to be. l Sam. 11:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the Spirit of God came upon Saul mightily when he heard
these words, and he became very angry.” (1 Samuel 11:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At first, Saul used the power of the Holy Spirit and led
the army of Israel to a great victory when all the rest of the people were
afraid. 1 Sam. 11. God gave Saul a command in 1 Samuel 10:6-8 to wait seven
days for Samuel, but Samuel did not show up and Saul got nervous. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Then the Spirit of the LORD will come upon you mightily,
and you shall prophesy with them and be changed into another man. &quot;It
shall be when these signs come to you, do for yourself what the occasion
requires, for God is with you. &quot;And you shall go down before me to Gilgal;
and behold, I will come down to you to offer burnt offerings and sacrifice
peace offerings. You shall wait seven days until I come to you and show you
what you should do.&quot;” (1 Samuel 10:6-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Samuel 13:8, Saul needed to go and fight the enemy,
but knew that there should be a sacrifice to the Lord first, by a prophet. But
Saul was not a prophet. Saul’s old sin nature said, “Don’t obey the Lord,” but
Saul went on negative volition and disobeyed the Lord. 1 Sam. 13:9-13. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Now he waited seven days, according to the appointed time set
by Samuel, but Samuel did not come to Gilgal; and the people were scattering
from him.” (1 Samuel 13:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So Saul said, &quot;Bring to me the burnt offering and the
peace offerings.&quot; And he offered the burnt offering. As soon as he
finished offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to
meet him and to greet him. But Samuel said, &quot;What have you done?&quot; And
Saul said, &quot;Because I saw that the people were scattering from me, and
that you did not come within the appointed days, and that the Philistines were
assembling at Michmash, therefore I said, 'Now the Philistines will come down
against me at Gilgal, and I have not asked the favor of the LORD.' So I forced
myself and offered the burnt offering.&quot; Samuel said to Saul, &quot;You
have acted foolishly; you have not kept the commandment of the LORD your God,
which He commanded you, for now the LORD would have established your kingdom
over Israel forever.” (1 Samuel 13:9-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Lord gave Saul another command to utterly destroy all
people and animals of Amalek in 1 Samuel 15:2-3. Again Saul disobeyed. 1 Sam.
15:8-9. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'I will punish Amalek for
what he did to Israel, how he set himself against him on the way while he was
coming up from Egypt. 'Now go and strike Amalek and utterly destroy all that he
has, and do not spare him; but put to death both man and woman, child and
infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.'&quot;” (1 Samuel 15:2-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He captured Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly
destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword. But Saul and the people
spared Agag and the best of the sheep, the oxen, the fatlings, the lambs, and
all that was good, and were not willing to destroy them utterly; but everything
despised and worthless, that they utterly destroyed.” (1 Samuel 15:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As Saul lived more and more under the control of his old
sin nature, scar tissue began to take its toll, destroying the norms and
standards in the conscience in the right lobe of his soul. He became an animal,
even though he was a believer.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When he found out that David was to be the next king
instead of his own son, he became terribly jealous from the area of weakness of
his old sin nature. From his jealousy came hatred along with other mental
attitude sins. From hatred came the desire and attempts to kill David. Only God's
overruling will protected David and spared his life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Saul’s human good production from the old sin nature (his
area of weakness) was also unacceptable to God, as was the human good
production of Ananias and Sapphira, which was from their old sin natures’ area
of strength. Sins are produced from the area of weakness. Saul died under the
sin unto death. 1 Chron. 10:13. See category on <a href="#_Ananias_and_Sapphira">Ananias
and Sapphira</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So Saul died for his trespass which he committed against the
LORD, because of the word of the LORD which he did not keep; and also because
he asked counsel of a medium, making inquiry of it,” (1 Chronicles 10:13, NASB)</p>
