<h2>Suffering From Death of a Loved One</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Regarding the doctrine of the resurrection of our Lord
Jesus Christ, Peter had understood the doctrine, but had not yet believed it.
He only had <i>gnosis</i> or factual knowledge in the left lobe of his soul.
His solution would be faith. John, on the other hand, had believed the doctrine
of the resurrection as <i>epignosis</i> in the right lobe of his soul, but had
an incomplete picture. The solution was more Bible doctrine. Mary Magdalene was
is an emotional state of mourning. Mary’s emotional state came when she was mourning
the death of her Savior and was undergoing an emotional overload. All three
were undergoing undeserved suffering.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Exposition of Mary’s reaction to the absence of Christ’s
body </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Response to a crisis must come from the believer’s frame
of reference in the right lobe of the soul. When you do not yet have enough <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the soul and if your soul is not controlled
by God the Holy Spirit, you will not correctly apply the Bible doctrine you
have believed. John 20:9. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For as yet they did not understand the Scripture, that He must
rise again from the dead.” (John 20:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The problem here was an incomplete picture of Bible
doctrine. You possess a rare trait if you can put a doctrine on the back burner
and let it percolate without going off half charged. In John 20:9, “For as yet
they did not understand the Scripture” is the pluperfect active indicative of <span
lang=EL>οι</span>̓͂<span lang=EL>δα</span> (oida) plus the adverb <span
lang=EL>ου</span>̓<span lang=EL>δε</span>́<span lang=EL>πω</span> (oudepō) and
means never yet, there was a total blackout. “They” refers to Peter and John,
but not Mary Magdalene. Neither Peter and John understood the significance of
the resurrection. They simply had only <i>gnosis</i> in the left lobe of the
soul. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They didn’t understand the resurrection even through it
was taught in the Old Testament. Yes, they understood the feast of first
fruits, the Levitical offerings, and certain prophecies. And yet, they did not
associate the empty tomb with the resurrection of Jesus Christ. So, somewhere
there was a short circuit of unbelief in the grace apparatus for perception.
Apparently Peter and John had not believed this doctrine where the Holy Spirit
would have converted the <i>gnosis</i> to <i>epignosis</i> and transferred it
to the right lobe of the soul. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>But with Mary, she had transferred and stored the
doctrine of the resurrection as <i>epignosis</i>, but at the time she was too
emotional in her grief to recall for application. She was so overtaken with
grief at the tragedy of the empty tomb that she could not apply the <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine to the situation. As a result, she had suffering. It was not
long, but enough for us to learn a fantastic lesson in the doctrine of
suffering.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 20:10, “went away” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span
lang=EL>πε</span>́<span lang=EL>ρχομαι</span> (aperchomai) and means they went
face to face with their own. The emphasis is on the people more than on the
house. Peter was returning to his wife and mother-in-law. John returned to his
mother and Mary, the mother of Jesus. John 19:27. </p>

<p class=Verses>“So the disciples went away again to their own homes.” (John
20:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then He said to the disciple, &quot;Behold, your mother!&quot;
From that hour the disciple took her into his own household.” (John 19:27,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Notice when people are upset, they go somewhere even if
only in their minds. Home is not in the passage. They go to their own people,
their family. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 20:11, “But Mary” means that she did not go to
people because the only one she loved in her own mind was dead. This was
personal love toward God. In a sense they all went to their own. She knew that
Peter and John would be chatting as they went their way. She felt as do they,
that someone had stolen the body out of the tomb. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But Mary was standing outside the tomb weeping; and so, as she
wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb;” (John 20:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Therefore, she was going to the place where she had last
seen her Lord’s body. She couldn’t leave the empty tomb because she was a
responder and she was responding to what was before her, an empty tomb. There
is a difference here between an aggressor and a responder. Therefore, she wept.
Everything she did at this point was the instinct of a great woman. She had
rapport love and she wanted privacy. She didn’t need people around, but her
emotions were so overloaded that she couldn’t apply Bible doctrine from her
frame of reference. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The tomb was open, the body was stolen, and the tomb was
empty. It was just too much and hysteria, disorientation and panic had set it.
She couldn’t apply the doctrine. She was suffering grief as only a woman can.
Peter and John were suffering, but not unduly. They could walk and talk. They
ran back to their own nest. The only thing in the world that Mary had was the
Lord and she thought He was gone. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 20:11, “standing” is the pluperfect of <span
lang=EL>ι</span>̔́<span lang=EL>στημι</span> (histēmi) and is very intensive.
A pluperfect is a past perfect and means she had been standing. That was while
Peter and John were leaving.  She couldn’t see anything, so she kept standing.
“Weeping” is the present active participle of <span lang=EL>κλαι</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (klaiō) and means she kept on weeping.  Use of the verb
indicates that the Greeks didn’t think much of weeping. Greeks never wept at
funerals. They screamed but never cried. This started out as bona fide weeping
but went into non-bona fide continuous weeping.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“As she wept” is the imperfect active indicative of <span
lang=EL>κλαι</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (klaiō) where the imperfect tense
indicates that it was prolonged beyond what it should have been. The participle
modifies the indicative mood and it means that her weeping was now out of
bounds. “She stooped” is <span lang=EL>παρακυ</span>́<span lang=EL>πτω</span>
(parakuptō) and means to stoop to a thing in order to look at it, to look at
with head bowed forward. The weeping of Mary was a woman’s love responding to
what she had, an empty tomb. You can see what happened to her. She wept because
even His body was not there. So she responded with “out of bounds” weeping. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mary had privacy at the empty tomb. Privacy plus free
will are the ingredients of a woman’s love. Some men are idiots and will never
learn this. Do you think you can force, coerce, or pressure a woman into loving
you? You snap your fingers and expect the woman to bow down and love you? </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If her love doesn’t come of her own free will, it is not
worth having. It isn’t love. It’s slavery. If you rip away a woman’s privacy
and you rip away that mysterious something that put the icing on the cake. It
will destroy the romance of a lifetime. By the way, the Bible teaches
everything about women and about men. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If she had remained with Peter and John they would have
been talking. One thing about them, they were never at a loss for words. This
tells you something. In times of stress, who wants to gab? Men or women? The
men. The women would rather remain quiet. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>She didn’t want conversation. Why? She wanted privacy.
Why? She didn’t want conversation because she had to think as a woman in love
would do. It was a greater test of faith-rest to face the empty tomb alone
without the rapport of friends. Now, put this in your mind. In solitude of
privacy, you discover what you believe. It may be right, it may be wrong. But
in the company of friends, you simply discover what you understand.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 20:12, “and she saw two angels” is the present
active indicative of <span lang=EL>θεωρε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(theōreō) and means to perceive with the eyes, to discern, to see. You would
expect “she saw” to be <span lang=EL>βλε</span>́<span lang=EL>πω</span>
(blepō) or <span lang=EL>ο</span>̔<span lang=EL>ρα</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(horaō) (panoramic view) but it is <i>theōreō</i>. <i>Theōreō</i> means
the angels were there all the time, but Peter and John didn’t see them and Mary
hadn’t seen them until now. Angels have bodies composed of light and this is
speaking of a translucent or partially transparent object. We know this from
Lucifer, son of the morning in Isaiah 14:12. This type of light means that it
can be observed under certain conditions and at certain angles. Occasionally a
shadow is thrown across the object in some way and they become observable.
Angels have been seen by people. </p>

<p class=Verses>“and she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head and
one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had been lying.” (John 20:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;How you have fallen from heaven, O star of the morning,
son of the dawn! You have been cut down to the earth, You who have weakened the
nations!” (Isaiah 14:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>And when angels are observed by people, they appear to be
as people. Angels appeared to Daniel and Zechariah. They appeared at some time
or another to every prophet. The mind and eyes are reflecting same word that
was used by Peter in John 20:6. God guarded the body, one at the foot and one
at the head. This is God’s way of comforting Mary. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And so Simon Peter also came, following him, and entered the
tomb; and he saw the linen wrappings lying there,” (John 20:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 20:12, “sitting” is <span lang=EL>καθε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ζομαι</span> (kathezomai) and means to seat oneself. They made
themselves visible. The presence of the angels proves that the body of Jesus
had not been stolen as Mary presumed. One angel at the head and another at the
feet where the body of our Lord Jesus Christ had been lying.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 20:13, Mary was crying. There was no need to cry
anymore. There is a time when tears need to be dried and we need to keep on
living. The angels asked “why are you weeping?” but they knew why. Men often
ask women why they are crying. They are often confused. They didn’t know she
was happy. They didn’t know she was sad. They didn’t know she was mad. They
didn’t know she was upset. A woman can be a thousand things and cry. It just
means that a woman is a responder. She has a supercharger on her emotions.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And they said to her, &quot;Woman, why are you weeping?&quot;
She said to them, &quot;Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know
where they have laid Him.&quot;” (John 20:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Women would go absolutely berserk if they didn’t have
this. Because she is a responder, this is her safety valve. It lets off the
extra pressure by weeping. Since a man is an initiator, he doesn’t need this
supercharger. Tears to a woman are a fantastic source of relief. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>These angels ask the question not because they did not
understand, but because Mary at this point was out of line. Her legitimate
weeping had turned to disorientation at the point in the past. If her frame of
reference had been functioning, she would have looked at the empty tomb and
concluded that her Lord and Savior had been resurrected. But, at this point she
was disoriented. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is why a woman can become angry at a man and still
love him. Her supercharger has broken down. She can even love a man and go out
and get drunk with another man then wake up in the morning and feel like 40
kinds of a donkey and her supercharger returns to normal. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mary thought they had snatched away the body of her Lord
and she did not know where they have placed His body. She got away by herself
and when she thought the thing through, she found out what she believed. A lie.
When someone believes a lie, they are never interested in the facts. When you
believe in a point of false doctrine, when you hear the true doctrine, you do
not believe it.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 20:14, Mary was not interested in talking with
the two angels. She gave them an answer. And then turned away from them. Her
interest was in the Lord and no one else. What does a woman do when the one she
loves is gone and then suddenly appears? She ran and threw her arms around Him.
A passive response would be absurd. She will not talk to strangers. The
principle here is that a woman in love is never a flirt. She is the glory of
the man she loves, but never a flirt. </p>

<p class=Verses>“When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus
standing there, and did not know that it was Jesus.” (John 20:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Saw Jesus standing there” is the perfect active
indicative of <span lang=EL>θεωρε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (theōreō)
which means He has been standing there for some time. “And did not know that it
was Jesus” is the pluperfect of <span lang=EL>οι</span>̓͂<span lang=EL>δα</span>
(oida) and is very intense. Why did Mary not recognize Jesus? Under emotional
stress and with her eyes filled with tears, her physical vision was impaired.
Therefore she saw, but she didn’t see. She was thinking about something else. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Her mind was made up with regard to something that was
false. While it was not true, Mary thought the body of Jesus had been stolen.
The principle here is that reality lies in what people think, not in the truth.
“Don’t confuse me with the facts, my mind is made up.” Since Mary assumed that
Jesus was dead, she could not associate any living person with Him. In her mind
He was dead, so this person could not be Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Here is the suffering. If she would have had the facts in
her frame of reference, she could have saved herself all this suffering. She
had a good imagination, but no facts. Reality is found in what people believe.
Therefore, Mary believed that Jesus was dead, so He couldn’t be alive. Her
assumption was the man she saw must be the gardener who usually would be around
this time of morning. Mary’s failure to recognize Christ emphasizes the
importance of getting facts before drawing conclusions.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 20:15, “Woman, why are you weeping?” is the
vocative of <span lang=EL>γυνη</span>́ (gunē). Jesus knew the answer to the
question. The question was needed to reorient Mary Magdalene. Her grief was a
part of the excessive emotional function of the soul. Ordinarily it is a bona
fide function. Remember that doctrine in the right lobe of the soul can be
applied toward God or man, but a pressure situation has to be handled from
frame of reference in the soul. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Jesus said to her, &quot;Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are
you seeking?&quot; Supposing Him to be the gardener, she said to Him,
&quot;Sir, if you have carried Him away, tell me where you have laid Him, and I
will take Him away.&quot;” (John 20:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Before Mary could recognize Jesus, she had to stop being
enslaved by her emotions. She was not mastering them. If you are a slave to
your emotions you are miserable. If you are master of them, you are happy. The
same principle is taught in Romans 16:17-18 and 2 Corinthians 6:11-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now I urge you, brethren, keep your eye on those who cause
dissensions and hindrances contrary to the teaching which you learned, and turn
away from them. For such men are slaves, not of our Lord Christ but of their
own appetites; and by their smooth and flattering speech they deceive the
hearts of the unsuspecting.” (Romans 16:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Our mouth has spoken freely to you, O Corinthians, our heart
is opened wide. You are not restrained by us, but you are restrained in your
own affections.” (2 Corinthians 6:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Both emotion and sorrow can take the believer out of
bounds where divine viewpoint is lost, even in mature believers. Excessive
emotion short circuits the frame of reference function. Reality was in the mind
of Mary. In her mind, Jesus was dead. Therefore, she did not recognize Jesus
when He spoke to her. But reality should have been in the facts, the doctrine
of resurrection. This is why she can stand right beside Him and not recognize
Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 20:15, “Supposing Him to be the gardener” was a
wrong assumption. She did not recognize our Lord. She only wanted to find Him
and offered to go and get Him and carry Him away. Her emotions were still
dictating to her. She had an edification complex in the right lobe of her soul,
but she had believed a lie. Mary was overly emotional and trying to think
without facts and had believed a lie.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 20:16, Mary was tone oriented to her name
pronounced by our Lord. It was pronounced in Aramaic. “She turned” is the
aorist passive participle of <span lang=EL>στρε</span>́<span lang=EL>φω</span>
(strephō) and means to turn around. She called our Lord “Teacher” which means
she was a responder to Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Jesus said to her, &quot;Mary!&quot; She turned and said to
Him in Hebrew, &quot;Rabboni!&quot; (which means, Teacher).” (John 20:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 20:17, “Stop clinging to Me” is the present
middle imperative of <span lang=EL>α</span>̔́<span lang=EL>πτω</span> (haptō) plus
the negative and means to stop fastening to, to stop kindling a fire, to stop
clinging. She grabbed Him and hugged Him with all her strength. The word means
to stop doing something that is in progress. Mary was clinging to Jesus with
reflex and with impulse of a woman in love. Her precious loved one, her
treasure, lost forever is now recovered forever through resurrection. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Jesus said to her, &quot;Stop clinging to Me, for I have not
yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brethren and say to them, 'I ascend to
My Father and your Father, and My God and your God.'&quot;” (John 20:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>She made certain by clinging to Him that He was not a
ghost. He was attractive but “hands off.” He wasn’t available. He was
attractive and a challenge (once conquered and brought to heel like Carmen). He
was a status symbol and attractive to her because of His status. He was
attractive and would be acceptable under any circumstances. This is true love.</p>
