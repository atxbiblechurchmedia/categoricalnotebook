<h2>Spiritual Endurance vs. Soul Embrittlement</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At salvation, the soul is saved, but has no stability
yet. The daily intake of Bible doctrine stabilizes the soul and gives endurance
of soul and removes the brittleness. This is the construction of the
edification complex of the soul. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Men who have the communication gifts of evangelist and
pastor-teacher have three purposes in teaching the Word. In Ephesians 4:11-12,
“equipping of the saints” is <span lang=EL>καταρτισμο</span>́<span lang=EL>ς</span>
(katartismos) in the Greek and means face to face teaching for the purpose of
perfecting or training and equipping for combat in the Angelic Conflict. “Work”
is <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓́<span lang=EL>ργον</span> (ergon) and means inner
unseen production of divine good from the right lobe of the soul. The Word of
God dominates the soul more and more as the believer grows spiritually.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some
as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the
saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ;” 
(Ephesians 4:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ephesians 4:11-12, “service” is <span lang=EL>διακονι</span>́<span
lang=EL>α</span> (diakonia) means spiritual service and refers to the universal
ministry of the believer. The grace apparatus for perception is the basis for
taking in the Word, building of the edification complex of the soul, and the
production of divine good. “Building” is <span lang=EL>οι</span>̓<span lang=EL>κοδομη</span>́
(oikodomē) and means edifying or to build a structure, the edification complex
of the soul, to spiritual maturity. This is for all Church Age believers or the
entire Body of Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The corrected translation of Ephesians 4:12 becomes,
“Face to face (teaching) for the equipping and training of the saints for
combat, for the production of the ministry (inner and overt) for the
edification of the Body of Christ.”</p>

<p class=Verses>“until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the
knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature
which belongs to the fullness of Christ.”  (Ephesians 4:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>These three purposes involved in the ministry of the
pastor-teacher have three objectives as summarized in Ephesians 4:13. “Until”
means the objective is now summarized, until all believers attain. All
believers must be under the authority of some pastor-teacher in a local church
to grow spiritually. When you find organizations floating loose who are not
under local churches where the pastor communicates doctrine, you are looking at
the flotsam and jetsam of the spiritual life. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ephesians 4:13, “attain” is <span lang=EL>καταντα</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (katantaō) and means to reach a goal, to arrive at a
destination, to arrive at an objective. The three objectives are unity of the
faith, full knowledge of God (completion of the edification complex of the
soul), and spiritual maturity. “To the unity of the faith” is not brotherhood
unity. It refers to the fact that everyone arrives in the same way. The pastor
communicates doctrine and the congregation takes in the Word under the grace
apparatus for perception and erects their edification complex in the soul. That
is unity. It refers to the objective of the faith or Bible doctrine as a system
of categorical <i>epignosis</i> in the heart or right lobe of the soul. <i>Epignosis</i>
is believed Bible doctrine or full knowledge of the Son of God. This includes
the application of rapport love toward God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“To a mature man” is <span lang=EL>τε</span>́<span
lang=EL>λειος</span> (teleios) and means spiritual maturity, completion of the
edification complex. A Christian in spiritual maturity is a part of Christian
nobility.  “Measure” is <span lang=EL>με</span>́<span lang=EL>τρον</span>
(metron) and means to the standard. “Stature” is <span lang=EL>η</span>̔<span
lang=EL>λικι</span>́<span lang=EL>α</span> (hēlikia) and means full age or
prime of life of the fullness of Christ and refers to His edification complex,
Christ’s maturity. “Fullness” is <span lang=EL>πλη</span>́<span lang=EL>ρωμα</span>
(plērōma) and is Jesus Christ having an edification complex of the soul as
the result of His function of the grace apparatus for perception. Luke 2:40;
Luke 2:52; John 1:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The Child continued to grow and become strong, increasing in
wisdom; and the grace of God was upon Him.”  (Luke 2:40, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And Jesus kept increasing in wisdom and stature, and in favor
with God and men.”  (Luke 2:52, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw His
glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.” 
(John 1:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The corrected translation of Ephesians 4:13, “Until we
all arrive at the objective (through the faithful teaching of the
pastor-teacher) with reference to the unity of the faith (system of doctrine)
and the epignosis (full knowledge) of the Son of God unto the mature nobleman,
unto the standard of the prime of life of the full development of Christ.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Missionaries must have the last characteristic, to have
iron in his soul, a soul of endurance, a soul free from any brittleness, a
mature soul. Paul is an illustration of spiritual endurance in 2 Timothy 4:7-8
and Hebrews 11:32-40.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I
have kept the faith; in the future there is laid up for me the crown of
righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that
day; and not only to me, but also to all who have loved His appearing.”  (2
Timothy 4:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And what more shall I say? For time will fail me if I tell of
Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets, who by
faith conquered kingdoms, performed acts of righteousness, obtained promises,
shut the mouths of lions, quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the
sword, from weakness were made strong, became mighty in war, put foreign armies
to flight. Women received back their dead by resurrection; and others were
tortured, not accepting their release, so that they might obtain a better
resurrection; and others experienced mockings and scourgings, yes, also chains
and imprisonment. They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were tempted,
they were put to death with the sword; they went about in sheepskins, in
goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated ( men of whom the world was
not worthy), wandering in deserts and mountains and caves and holes in the
ground. And all these, having gained approval through their faith, did not
receive what was promised, because God had provided something better for us, so
that apart from us they would not be made perfect.”  (Hebrews 11:32-40, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The enemy of spiritual endurance is brittleness of the
soul. Hardship is a vocabulary term for spiritual endurance or having iron in
the soul. 2 Tim. 2:3; Prov. 27:17; Jer. 13:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Suffer hardship with me, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.” 
(2 Timothy 2:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Iron sharpens iron, So one man sharpens another.”  (Proverbs
27:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““I will dash them against each other, both the fathers and the
sons together,” declares the LORD. “I will not show pity nor be sorry nor have
compassion so as not to destroy them.”‘““  (Jeremiah 13:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the ancient world, they understood the concept of the
shattering of a dried out wineskin. In Jeremiah 13:14, “I will dash” is the
piel imperfect of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>נָפַץ</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (naphats) and is very strong. God
indicates destruction of soul at the end of the verse “to destroy them.” This
is talking about the disintegration of the soul, the shattering of the soul,
the destruction of the soul of an individual as in Proverbs 6:32.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The one who commits adultery with a woman is lacking sense; He
who would destroy himself does it.”  (Proverbs 6:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The soul becomes brittle, in the context of Jeremiah 13,
when the believer fails to respond to doctrine and either goes into idolatry
where religion is substituted for Christianity or into sexual sins. There is a
fundamental type of religion, a conservative religion, and a liberal religion.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When the believer goes liberal to Bible doctrine, they
may be prospered by the devil, although they attribute it to the blessing of
God. As such, they conduct a frantic search for happiness. For example,
Solomon, even though out of fellowship was prospered materially, yet in his
frantic search he found nothing to satisfy him. The Book of Ecclesiastes covers
this in great detail.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In this context, when you drink the from jug of this
life, not only does the jug shatter in your face, but so does your soul. This
is called the sin unto death. 1 John 5:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If anyone sees his brother committing a sin not leading to
death, he shall ask and God will for him give life to those who commit sin not
leading to death. There is a sin leading to death; I do not say that he should
make request for this.”  (1 John 5:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Brittleness of soul can become a way of life for the
believer. When enough believers in a nation are in this shape, the country goes
into terrible divine judgment as did Judah in Jeremiah 13:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The cities of the Negev have been locked up, And there is no
one to open them; All Judah has been carried into exile, Wholly carried into
exile.”  (Jeremiah 13:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is the pursuit of happiness apart from divine
provision and divine design. Brittleness of soul is the antithesis of the
edification complex of the soul. A brittle soul is an unfulfilled soul. It must
be fulfilled by spiritual growth in <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine. Instead of
grace orientation, the brittle soul of a believer has legalism, human
viewpoint, self-righteousness, self-justification, pride, is a hypercritical
irritable character, is hypersensitive, and accepts no authority but their own.

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Instead of the mastery of the details of life, the
details master them. This leads to using cheap substitutes. Instead of a
relaxed mental attitude, a brittle soul has mental attitude sins of bitterness,
jealousy, hatred, and cruelty. Instead of capacity to love, a brittle soul has
pseudo love, a sticky-sweet love, boredom and instability. Instead of perfect
happiness, the brittle soul has depression, frustration, and instant
stimulation followed by constant misery. See category on <a
