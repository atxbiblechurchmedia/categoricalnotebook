<h2><a name="_D-The_Soul"></a>The Soul</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The soul has the ability to perceive, understand and
categorize human phenomena. To perceive is to obtain knowledge by the senses.
To understand is to obtain knowledge by the mind. To categorize is the means of
putting knowledge into a system. The real you is your soul. Gen. 2:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD God formed man of dust from the ground, and
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being.”
(Genesis 2:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All characteristics of the soul are not evident at the
same time. The soul is the seat of human misery. The body has a nervous system
that cause us to experience physical pain, but all mental and emotional misery is
in the soul. Emotional revolt of the soul causes wide emotional swings and a
spectrum of misery. Psalms 6:3; Psalms 106:15; Psalms 119:28.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And my soul is greatly dismayed; But You, O LORD—how long?”
(Psalms 6:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So He gave them their request, But sent a wasting disease
among them.” (Psalms 106:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“My soul weeps because of grief; Strengthen me according to
Your word.” (Psalms 119:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The soul is the basis of both mental attitude and rapport
love. 1 Sam. 18:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now it came about when he had finished speaking to Saul, that
the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as
himself.” (1 Samuel 18:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Once God the Father creates and imputes the soul at
physical birth, the soul never dies. Our souls are immortal. In Luke 16:23, the
rich man’s soul was still alive in Torments after his physical death. He was
looking across a great gulf fixed between Paradise and Torments. The real you
is your soul and will always live whether believer or unbeliever!</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;In Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torment, and
saw Abraham far away and Lazarus in his bosom.” (Luke 16:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The soul provides perceptive ability or awareness during
physical life and after death and transfer to heaven. 2 Cor. 12:2-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago—whether in the
body I do not know, or out of the body I do not know, God knows—such a man was
caught up to the third heaven. And I know how such a man—whether in the body or
apart from the body I do not know, God knows— was caught up into Paradise and
heard inexpressible words, which a man is not permitted to speak.” (2
Corinthians 12:2-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Format Soul and Soul Life</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Man’s soul, not the body, was made in the image of God.
Gen. 1:26-27. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then God said, &quot;Let Us make man in Our image, according
to Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds
of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth, and over every creeping
thing that creeps on the earth.&quot; God created man in His own image, in the
image of God He created him; male and female He created them.” (Genesis
1:26-27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 2:7, “formed” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>יצר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(yâtsar) and
means to form as a potter would form clay. “Breathed into” is <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>נפח</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(nâphach)
and “the breath of life” <span lang=HE dir=RTL>חַ</span><span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>יִּים</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'><span dir=LTR></span> </span><span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>נשׁמה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(neshâmâh chayyim) and means soul life.
“Living being” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>נפשׁ</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (nephesh) and means a soul having life. <i>Neshâmâh</i>
is the breath of God Himself. God generates human life when He breathes some of
His life into the newly born baby. At the point of physical birth, human life
results when soul life is imputed from God the Father to the format soul. Isaiah
42:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD God formed man of dust from the ground, and
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being.”
(Genesis 2:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Thus says God the LORD, Who created the heavens and stretched
them out, Who spread out the earth and its offspring, Who gives breath to the
people on it And spirit to those who walk in it,” (Isaiah 42:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The format of the soul exists with the embryo, but the
soul life does not exist until physical birth. The biological life of the
developing fetus exhibits movement called reflex motility. This accounts for
body movement, which is not human life. There is no human life until the soul
life is given by God at the point of physical birth.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 1:41 and Luke 1:44, “leaped” is <span lang=EL>σκιρτα</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (skirtaō) in the Greek and refers to reflex motility of the
fetus. This is fetus movement without thought. The fetus is not yet a
functioning soul, just a format soul. The rapid pulse of the mother affects the
fetus. “Joy” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>γαλλι</span>́<span
lang=EL>ασις</span> (agalliasis) and means exultation, extreme joy, gladness.
The great emotional response of Elizabeth resulted in an emotional joy in
greeting her cousin that caused a rapid heartbeat which started the reflex
motility of her unborn baby.</p>

<p class=Verses>“When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in her
womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.” (Luke 1:41, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For behold, when the sound of your greeting reached my
ears, the baby leaped in my womb for joy.” (Luke 1:44, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The human body is formed by procreation, therefore the
human body is a product of inheritance. The format soul is formed with the body
and is also inherited. The mentality of the soul is inherited from the
mentality genes of both parents. God does not make the format soul, it is
inherited from the parents. Otherwise all mentality would be equal. God does
not make the old sin nature either. The old sin nature is inherited from the
father. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Development of soul essence is based upon mentality. The
decisions you make, emotional development, norms or standards in your
conscience, the poise or lack of it in your self-consciousness are all related
to mentality.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At physical birth, God the Father imputes soul life to
the format soul in the newly born baby, resulting in physical life. In Isaiah
57:16, “breath” is the qal perfect of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>נשׁמה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>(neshâmâh) and refers to the soul lives of people. The qal perfect
means completed action with finished results in present time. “Those whom I
have made” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>עָשָׂה</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(asah) and means to
construct. God makes a living soul out of a format soul which has no life. Only
God can impart the spark of life. The term spark of life is not used in the
sense of eternal salvation.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For I will not contend forever, Nor will I always be
angry; For the spirit would grow faint before Me, And the breath of those whom
I have made.” (Isaiah 57:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The body is the area of human life, but does not receive
life until the soul life is added at physical birth. Therefore the embryo of
the child in the womb does not experience joy, misery, love, or anything else
pertaining to life until after physical birth.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Job 33:4, “Spirit of God” refers to God the Holy
Spirit. “The breath” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>נשׁמה</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(neshâmâh) and
refers to God breathing soul life into the format soul resulting in human life.
“The Almighty” refers to God the Father. “Gives me life” refers to physical
human life. God breathes the spark of life to the newly born baby at physical
birth resulting in human life. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;The Spirit of God has made me, And the breath of the
Almighty gives me life.” (Job 33:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ezekiel 18:4 indicates that God gives the soul life to
both father and son. The father passes on soul format, but not soul life. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Behold, all souls are Mine; the soul of the father as
well as the soul of the son is Mine. The soul who sins will die.” (Ezekiel
18:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ecclesiastes 12:7 and Zechariah 12:1, “spirit” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>רוּח</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(rûach) and refers to soul life. </p>

<p class=Verses>“then the dust will return to the earth as it was, and the
spirit will return to God who gave it.” (Ecclesiastes 12:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The burden of the word of the LORD concerning Israel. Thus
declares the LORD who stretches out the heavens, lays the foundation of the
earth, and forms the spirit of man within him,” (Zechariah 12:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Essence of the Soul</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Self-consciousness</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The soul includes self-consciousness which is self-awareness
of the soul. In 1 Corinthians 15:10, “by the grace of God, I am what I am”
refers to the mentality or the thinking part of the soul.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace
toward me did not prove vain; but I labored even more than all of them, yet not
I, but the grace of God with me.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 15:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Self-consciousness makes us aware of our own existence
and makes us able to relate to both animate life and inanimate objects on earth.
Animals have consciousness, but not self-consciousness. Acts 20:10; 1 Kings
17:21; Gen. 2:7; Gen. 35:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But Paul went down and fell upon him, and after embracing him,
he said, &quot;Do not be troubled, for his life is in him.&quot;” (Acts 20:10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then he stretched himself upon the child three times, and
called to the LORD and said, &quot;O LORD my God, I pray You, let this child's
life return to him.&quot;” (1 Kings 17:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD God formed man of dust from the ground, and
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being.”
(Genesis 2:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Volition</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Father, in His sovereignty and grace, decided in
eternity past to provide man with uncoerced free will or volition. We can
decide for or against anything in life. There are consequences for each, but we
are free to decide. Our free will is why man was created to resolve the Angelic
Conflict. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/UV/Volition.html">Volition</a>. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The soul is the source of all sin because volition or
free will resides in the soul. The soul is where the spiritual battles are
fought in life. Matt. 10:28; Eph. 4:17-19; Psalms 143.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Do not fear those who kill the body but are unable to
kill the soul; but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in
hell.” (Matthew 10:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So this I say, and affirm together with the Lord, that you
walk no longer just as the Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their mind,
being darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life of God because of
the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart; and
they, having become callous, have given themselves over to sensuality for the
practice of every kind of impurity with greediness.” (Ephesians 4:17-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><a name="_Volition_1"></a>The soul includes volition or
the decider of the soul. Negative volition causes a vacuum in the soul into
which are pulled false and evil concepts from Satan’s world system of evil and
deception. Negative volition is expressed through the old sin nature as either
sin, human good, evil, or emotional revolt. All negative volition results in
divine discipline. Rom. 1; Rom. 2; Jer. 17:9. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;The heart is more deceitful than all else And is
desperately sick; Who can understand it?&quot;  (Jeremiah 17:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Positive volition is expressed through the filling of the
Holy Spirit and the daily function of the grace apparatus for perception.
Positive volition is expressed through the application of the Word of God to
experience resulting in divine blessing. Gal. 5:22-23; Acts 20; Rom. 12:1-2. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,
patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against
such things there is no law.&quot;  (Galatians 5:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to
present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is
your spiritual service of worship. And do not be conformed to this world, but
be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the
will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect.&quot;  (Romans
12:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>While the old sin nature is in the genetic structure of
each human cell and is the source of internal temptation, when you sin whether
knowingly or unknowingly, you decide to do so in your soul. This is your
volition in action. That is why it is the soul that has to be saved. Ezek. 18:4;
Lev. 5:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Behold, all souls are Mine; the soul of the father as
well as the soul of the son is Mine. The soul who sins will die.” (Ezekiel
18:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“'Now if a person sins after he hears a public adjuration to
testify when he is a witness, whether he has seen or otherwise known, if he
does not tell it, then he will bear his guilt.” (Leviticus 5:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Emotion</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Emotion is the capacity to appreciate spiritual life and
capacity to appreciate temporal life. Emotions are the appreciator of the soul.
Emotion responds or reacts to whatever thoughts we have. Ideally, our emotions
are dominated by our thinking from the right lobe of the soul. Luke 12:19; Phil.
2:1. </p>

<p class=Verses>“'And I will say to my soul, &quot;Soul, you have many goods
laid up for many years to come; take your ease, eat, drink and be
merry.&quot;'” (Luke 12:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if
there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if
any affection and compassion,&quot;  (Philippians 2:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Through Bible doctrine, our emotions come to appreciate
God and what He has done for us in grace. We are not to be dominated by our
emotions. If the emotions do not have <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine
controlling them, then havoc is the result and often results in the believer getting
into false doctrine. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/E/Emotions.html">Emotions</a>.  See
category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/E/Emotional%20Revolt%20of%20The%20Soul.html">Emotional Revolt of the Soul.</a> </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Mentality</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mentality is the thinking part of man and is composed of
two parts – the left lobe or perceptive lobe of the soul and the right lobe of
the soul or the “heart.” All human thought originates in these two lobes of the
soul. Rom. 1:20-22; Prov. 19:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes,
His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood
through what has been made, so that they are without excuse. For even though
they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give thanks, but they became
futile in their speculations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing
to be wise, they became fools,” (Romans 1:20-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Also it is not good for a person to be without knowledge, And
he who hurries his footsteps errs.” (Proverbs 19:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The left lobe of the soul is the recessive lobe or
perceptive lobe where spiritually understood Bible doctrine in the form of <i>gnosis</i>
resides and is a staging area. From this left lobe, if the Bible doctrine is
believed, the Holy Spirit transfers the <i>gnosis</i> doctrine to the right
lobe of the soul as <i>epignosis</i> doctrine – ready to be applied to the
issues and situations of life.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The right lobe of the soul is the dominant lobe, the
authoritative area or headquarters of the soul. “For as he thinks within
himself, so he is.” Prov. 23:7. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For as he thinks within himself, so he is. He says to
you, &quot;Eat and drink!&quot; But his heart is not with you.&quot;  (Proverbs
23:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The heart or right lobe of the soul contains the Frame of
Reference, the Memory Center, Vocabulary Storage, Categorical Storage, the
Conscience, Spiritual Growth, and Wisdom. These compartments all participate in
the believer’s application of <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine to life. See
category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/S/The%20Right%20Lobe%20of%20the%20Soul.html">The Right Lobe of the Soul</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Soul Life and Spiritual Death at Birth</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At physical birth, soul life is imputed to the format
soul of the baby and the baby is then a living human being. The format soul
becomes alive and begins to function and express what is in the format soul
which includes self-consciousness, volition, emotion and the conscience. All of
these are influenced by both soul mentality and the old sin nature, which are
both inherited. Self-consciousness, volition, emotion, and the conscience are
influenced. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When Adam’s original sin is imputed by God the Father to
the genetically-formed old sin nature at birth, there is spiritual death.
Therefore, man is born physically alive and spiritually dead simultaneously.
Rom. 5:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world,
and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned—”
(Romans 5:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Old Sin Nature vs. the Soul</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The old sin nature is not part of the soul. It is
genetically formed in every cell of the human body and is inherited through the
father. It battles for control of the soul through sin, human good and evil.
Because we have an old sin nature, we are said to be totally depraved. Jer.
17:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;The heart is more deceitful than all else And is
desperately sick; Who can understand it?” (Jeremiah 17:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The old sin nature is the distorter of the soul. 1 John
1:8-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves
and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and
righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If
we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar and His word is not in
us.&quot;  (1 John 1:8-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Without Bible doctrine in the soul, you tend to run loose
with your old sin nature's area of strength and link this activity with pride.
Therefore, you use your mentality to say you are something you are not. You set
up your system of standards and compare yourself to others to further your
pride.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer who is filled with the Holy Spirit and has <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the soul frustrates the old sin nature.
When the old sin nature controls the soul, the believer can only produce human
good from the area of strength and sins from the area of weakness. See category

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Human Spirit vs. the Soul</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A distinction must be made between the soul and the human
spirit, even though they operate in conjunction with each other. Hebrews 4:12
makes a distinction between the soul and the human spirit.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any
two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of
both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the
heart.” (Hebrews 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Prior to the Fall, man was trichotomous, having a body,
soul, and spirit. Gen. 2:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD God formed man of dust from the ground, and
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being.”
(Genesis 2:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>After the Fall, man is born dichotomous, having only a
body and soul. Prior to accepting the work of Jesus Christ on the Cross by
faith, the unbeliever cannot understand spiritual information. 1 Cor. 2:14;
Jude 1:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of
God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because
they are spiritually appraised.” (1 Corinthians 2:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“These are the ones who cause divisions, worldly-minded, devoid
of the Spirit.” (Jude 1:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When the believer exercises faith in the work of the Lord
Jesus Christ on the Cross, they are said to be “born again.”  Faith belief
results in regeneration where God the Holy Spirit gives each believer a human
spirit. All believers have a physical body, a soul, and a human spirit meaning
there are trichotomous. The believer is now spiritually alive. 1 Thess. 5:23;
Eph. 2:1; Eph. 2:5. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/H/The%20Human%20Spirit.html">The Human
Spirit</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you entirely; and
may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame at the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.” (1 Thessalonians 5:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And you were dead in your trespasses and sins,” (Ephesians
2:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive
together with Christ (by grace you have been saved),” (Ephesians 2:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The physical body cannot not be saved because the old sin
nature resides genetically in every cell. At the point of salvation, only the
soul is saved. This salvation is strictly a matter of God's grace. In eternity,
the soul of the believer will be united with a perfect resurrection body with
no old sin nature and no human good. Eph. 2:8-9; Psalms 19:7; Psalms 34:22;
Mark 8:36-37; 1 Peter 1:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not
of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one
may boast.” (Ephesians 2:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The law of the LORD is perfect, restoring the soul; The
testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.” (Psalms 19:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD redeems the soul of His servants, And none of those
who take refuge in Him will be condemned.” (Psalms 34:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world,
and forfeit his soul? &quot;For what will a man give in exchange for his soul?”
(Mark 8:36-37, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“obtaining as the outcome of your faith the salvation of your
souls.” (1 Peter 1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Soul and Physical Death</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The human body is the temporary house for the soul. When the
soul departs from the body, physical death results. 2 Cor. 5:1-4; Job 27:8; Psalms
16:10; 2 Cor. 5:8; Gen. 35:18. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/D/Physical%20Death.html">Physical
Death</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For we know that if the earthly tent which is our house is
torn down, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in
the heavens. For indeed in this house we groan, longing to be clothed with our
dwelling from heaven, inasmuch as we, having put it on, will not be found
naked. For indeed while we are in this tent, we groan, being burdened, because
we do not want to be unclothed but to be clothed, so that what is mortal will
be swallowed up by life.” (2 Corinthians 5:1-4, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For what is the hope of the godless when he is cut off,
When God requires his life?” (Job 27:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For You will not abandon my soul to Sheol; Nor will You allow
Your Holy One to undergo decay.” (Psalms 16:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“we are of good courage, I say, and prefer rather to be absent
from the body and to be at home with the Lord.” (2 Corinthians 5:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“It came about as her soul was departing (for she died), that
she named him Ben-oni; but his father called him Benjamin.” (Genesis 35:18,
NASB)</p>
