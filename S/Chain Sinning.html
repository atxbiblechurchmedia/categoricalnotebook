<h2><a name="_Sin_Unto_Death"></a><a name="_Gentiles_Under_Sin"></a><a
name="_Chain_Sinning"></a>Chain Sinning</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 12:13, “and make straight paths for your feet”
refers to feet as they represent the principle of service for the believer. The
present active imperative of the verb <span lang=EL>ποιε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(poieō) means we are to continue make straight paths as long as we live on
this earth. This has to do with wheel tracks and refers to the road to God’s
will for your life. Stay with God’s plan and do God’s will in your life. </p>

<p class=Verses>“and make straight paths for your feet, so that the limb which
is lame may not be put out of joint, but rather be healed.”  (Hebrews 12:13,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has a personal plan for your life. You are in full
time Christian service. He formulated this plan billions and billions of years
ago. You get off God’s plan because of carnality. When you stay on this road to
spiritual maturity, you gain perfect inner peace and happiness.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“So that the limb which is lame” is <span lang=EL>χωλο</span>́<span
lang=EL>ς</span> (chōlos) and means to be obviously crippled such that normal
walk is obviously affected. Normal walk is in fellowship. This phrase is a
reference to a crippled Christian. This means that the lame do not swerve or
turn off of a road. This is chain sinning, failure to isolate sin and failure
to ever confess sins to God the Father to regain fellowship with God and the
filling of the Holy Spirit whereby you can grow spiritually. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“But rather be healed” is the aorist passive subjunctive
of <span lang=EL>ι</span>̓<span lang=EL>α</span>́<span lang=EL>ομαι</span>
(iaomai) and means healed or restored. After you confess sins, you must forget
the sins, and then isolate them. It is up to you. Are you going to stay
restored or not? You receive fellowship restoration with the Holy Spirit when
you use 1 John 1:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The greatest danger one second after confession of sins
to God the Father is to enter into mental attitude sins. This perpetuates chain
sinning. All chain sinning is perpetuated in what you think, not what you do.
Chain sinning is a mental attitude reaction to a sin that has already been
forgiven because you confessed it.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Most Christians are not orientated to the Christian way
of life and the grace of God for one reason. They react to a sin which is dead.
This keeps them perpetually out of fellowship. They are reactors instead of
responders.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Pattern of Chain Sinning</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is a problem of snatching or grabbing at some
system immediately to get yourself back into God’s good graces. The conflict is
between the reality of the believer in fellowship versus the pseudo-reality of
the believer out of fellowship.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For the believer in fellowship, they learn or take on the
inner happiness produced by the Lord. It is a combination of joy and
contentment. You may have made many people unhappy, but you haven’t ever made
God unhappy. God has never lost His cool even for a minute. When you have
gained some of God’s happiness, you gain a relaxed mental attitude. This gives
you a capacity for love in all the categories - toward God, toward your wife or
husband, toward people, toward the details of life, and an orientation to grace.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For the believer out of fellowship, they experience
self-induced misery. They always react to things. Such people are always
unhappy. When you find a believer who is always miserable, they always want the
happiness, blessings, joys, and testimonies they hear messages about.
Unfortunately, it is always around the corner and over the next hill. They try
harder and become legalistic. They try some system of human good ascetics like
reading their Bible an hour a day or praying more. They try some system of emotionalism
like going forward and dedicating themselves or doing something without
thinking like marching in a mob.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Then someone tells them about a Bible conference or a
deeper life retreat or a victorious life conference, so they go do that.
Someone says there is a special speaker in town and he’s got the answer to
life’s problems, so they go to that. Then someone says there is a great
experience they can have, so they try that. Then someone says, “You’ve tried
all these things, and you’re still miserable, so why don’t you get drunk?” So
they try that.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The next step could be the psychiatrist and they do what they
suggest. Then they have a nervous breakdown and a certain therapy is suggested
so they try that. Then someone suggests making points with God by attending a
church where you get ten points for bringing a visitor, tithing, being on time,
or going to a youth group. Then someone comes along and says they need to get
married so they try that and end up in divorce. Someone says, you need to move
or get a different job and so they try that.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is not the plan of God! However, these people are
loved by God. The pseudo (carnal believer) and the real (spiritual believer)
both have personal plans for their lives authored by God. The difference is
that the pseudo believers are off the road. Both groups know how to confess sin
biblically, but the pseudo believers are spiritual babies and they react. The
others are responders and once they get into fellowship, they forget the sin
and move on.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer on the road is the responder. The believer
off the road (out of fellowship) is a reactor. The reactors never get
straightened out unless they can understand what this lesson is teaching.
Remember that the reaction is always in the mind. It is not physical. You are
wrong to react. The right kind of thinking is response.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mental attitude sins are the worst because they are
subtle. They not only get you off the highway, but they get you to go for every
stupid, ridiculous, legalistic system that has ever existed. Some have tried
everything from pleading the blood which is sheer heresy, to praying to the
Holy Spirit, to trying to “get the Ghost,” to trying to have a super ecstatic
experience, to sublimating, seeing a psychiatrist, having a nervous breakdown, and
having a change of environment. You get worse and worse and worse. The more
desperate you become, the more straws you grasp at and every straw you grasp at
is pseudo-spirituality.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You need to have enough faith-rest to decide to confess
your known sins to God the Father and trust that that sin is gone, behind you,
forgiven by God. You confess the sin, an awful sin, a horrible sin and all are
forgiven. Then you begin to think how could God forgive such a horrible sin. It
was so horrible, you want to make up for it in some way and then you start in
resenting anyone involved in the sin. Reaction sets in, then you project the
sins onto others, then you become bitter. You are perpetually out of
fellowship. You are so miserable you would try anything.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>No believer should have a true close friend in an
unbeliever. But, you don’t reach this conclusion until you have spiritual
growth. Once you become a believer, all category three friendships are with
believers. There is no question but that a lot of your unbelieving
acquaintances are a lot nicer than your believing friends for a lot of reasons.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A lot of people say that confession of sin doesn’t work.
The problem is with you, not with the grace principle of confession of sin.
There has never been a case when confession of sin using 1 John 1:9 didn’t work
and a sin was not cleansed. Out of the mental reaction comes psychosomatic
swings. So you have self-induced misery from mental attitude sins and divine
discipline because you are out of fellowship. Now you are looking for a patsy
and start maligning. Then you receive their discipline (triple compound
discipline). This is all a prelude to the sin unto death. You are a walking
grenade with the pin out. You blow up and other people get hurt.</p>
