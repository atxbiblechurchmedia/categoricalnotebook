<h2><a name="_D-Sins_of_the"></a>Sins Against the Holy Spirit </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are five sins that can be committed against the
Holy Spirit, two by unbelievers and three by believers.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit is the rejection of
Jesus Christ as Savior in the Age of Israel. While our Lord was on earth,
certain individuals attributed His works to the devil. Rejection of the saving
work of Jesus Christ is called the unpardonable or unforgiveable sin. Matt.
12:31-32.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;Therefore I say to you, any sin and blasphemy
shall be forgiven people, but blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be
forgiven. &quot;Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it shall be
forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be
forgiven him, either in this age or in the age to come. &quot;  (Matthew
12:31-32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Resisting the Holy Spirit is the rejection of Jesus
Christ as Savior in the Church Age and is finalized in the unbeliever’s
physical death. If an unsaved person dies in status quo Christ rejection, their
soul’s destination is hell and ultimately the Lake of Fire. There is no second
chance. Acts 7:51.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;You men who are stiff-necked and uncircumcised in
heart and ears are always resisting the Holy Spirit; you are doing just as your
fathers did.&quot;  (Acts 7:51, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Lying to the Holy Spirit is inordinate ambition and
competition in the spiritual life. In Acts 5, Ananias and Sapphira are examples
of lying to the Holy Spirit due to inordinate competition and died the sin unto
death. This was a very serious sin of false inner motivation involving their
sale of some land and lying to the Jerusalem church congregation about donating
the entire sale price to the church. They were real estate competitors of
Barnabas who had earlier sold some of his land and donated the proceeds to the
Jerusalem church. Ananias and Sapphira had lied about having held back some of
the monies for themselves from their land sale. Acts 5:3-5; Acts 5:9-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But Peter said, &quot;Ananias, why has Satan filled your
heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back some of the price of the land?
&quot;While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own? And after it was
sold, was it not under your control? Why is it that you have conceived this
deed in your heart? You have not lied to men but to God.&quot; And as he heard
these words, Ananias fell down and breathed his last; and great fear came over
all who heard of it.&quot;  (Acts 5:3-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then Peter said to her, &quot;Why is it that you have
agreed together to put the Spirit of the Lord to the test? Behold, the feet of
those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out
as well. &quot; And immediately she fell at his feet and breathed her last, and
the young men came in and found her dead, and they carried her out and buried
her beside her husband.&quot;  (Acts 5:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Quenching the Holy Spirit is an act of disobedience that
does not involve an ethical or moral issue, like neglecting to pray. 1 Thess.
5:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Do not quench the Spirit;&quot;  (1 Thessalonians 5:19,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Grieving the Holy Spirit involves an ethical or moral
issue, such as adultery. Eph. 4:30.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were
sealed for the day of redemption.&quot;  (Ephesians 4:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Both spirituality and spiritual growth are commanded in
Scripture. Eph. 5:18; 2 Peter 3:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation,
but be filled with the Spirit,&quot;  (Ephesians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and
Savior Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory, both now and to the day of eternity.
Amen.&quot;  (2 Peter 3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Remember that spirituality is not something reserved for
the emotional. Often “walking in the Spirit” involves times of pain or
depression. How you feel does not determine spirituality. You are not spiritual
because you roll in the aisles, clap your hands, go around grinning like a
baboon, or stand on your head and sing “Do Lord” several hundred times. Even a
smile does not make you spiritual. Sometimes a song-leader will say, “You all
look so unhappy, let’s all smile on this one.” You are not spiritual because
you can lower your eyes to half mast, talk in a sweet voice, or shuffle your
feet. The Spirit of God can control any believer, regardless of their
personality!</p>
