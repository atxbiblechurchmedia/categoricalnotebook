<h2><a name="_D-Undeserved_Suffering_Involving_1"></a>Undeserved Suffering
Involving Physical and Mental Infirmities</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God's Grace Provision</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has made provision of His grace for mental illness, but
what about physical defects and infirmities that seem to contradict full
service for the Lord and the function of the spiritual gift you received at
salvation? In the soul of every believer, there is a conflict of being either
carnally minded or spiritually minded. We are to exercise positive volition in
Christ to deliver us. Rom. 8:14; Rom. 8:24; Rom. 8:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are sons
of God.” (Romans 8:14, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“For in hope we have been saved, but hope that is seen is not
hope; for who hopes for what he already sees?” (Romans 8:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on
the Spirit is life and peace,” (Romans 8:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We have the divine promise of a resurrection body because
we were all placed into union with Jesus Christ by the Holy Spirit at
salvation. We share all that Jesus Christ has and will have. Gal. 3:26-29. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. For
all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.
There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is
neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. And if you belong
to Christ, then you are Abraham's descendants, heirs according to promise.”
(Galatians 3:26-29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has made provision for the believer whereby we can
overcome our fears and instead focus on our eternal future in Jesus Christ. God
has also made provision of an eternal inheritance and for our temporal
suffering. Rom. 8:15-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For you have not received a spirit of slavery leading to fear
again, but you have received a spirit of adoption as sons by which we cry out,
&quot;Abba! Father!&quot; The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we
are children of God, and if children, heirs also, heirs of God and fellow heirs
with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him so that we may also be glorified with
Him.” (Romans 8:15-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Suffering of Nature</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is not understood widely, but creation is under a
terrible handicap, a terrific burden and it groans under its curse given by God
as punishment to Adam for sinning. Gen. 3:17-19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then to Adam He said, &quot;Because you have listened to the
voice of your wife, and have eaten from the tree about which I commanded you,
saying, 'You shall not eat from it'; Cursed is the ground because of you; In
toil you will eat of it All the days of your life. &quot;Both thorns and
thistles it shall grow for you; And you will eat the plants of the field; By
the sweat of your face You will eat bread, Till you return to the ground,
Because from it you were taken; For you are dust, And to dust you shall
return.&quot;” (Genesis 3:17-19, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The suffering of nature is used to illustrate the
suffering of man. Groaning looks back at the sin of Adam and suffering looks
forward to the Second Advent of our Lord Jesus Christ. Rom. 8:18-22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are
not worthy to be compared with the glory that is to be revealed to us. For the
anxious longing of the creation waits eagerly for the revealing of the sons of
God. For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of
Him who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself also will be set free
from its slavery to corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of
God. For we know that the whole creation groans and suffers the pains of
childbirth together until now.” (Romans 8:18-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s plan not only takes care of the deficiency of the
soul, but He also makes provision for the deficiency of the cursed earth and
the human body with its defects and blemishes. A cursed earth brings suffering and
glory and hopes for or anticipates the manifestation of the sons of God. Rom.
8:18-19; Rom. 8:28. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are
not worthy to be compared with the glory that is to be revealed to us. For the
anxious longing of the creation waits eagerly for the revealing of the sons of
God.” (Romans 8:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And we know that God causes all things to work together for
good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.”
(Romans 8:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A cursed earth is compatible with our old sin nature
resulting in pain, thorns, thistles, sweat, and identification with dust. As
the cursed earth is no problem to the believer so the thorn in the flesh is no
problem to a mature believer. Both are necessary for dependence upon the Lord’s
plan. A cursed earth now, but not forever. An old sin nature now, but not
forever. Rom. 8:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“that the creation itself also will be set free from its
slavery to corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God.”
(Romans 8:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A cursed earth is really under undeserved suffering. What
did the earth do to merit this? Nothing. In Romans 8:22, “groans” is <span
lang=EL>συστενα</span>́<span lang=EL>ζω</span> (sustenazō) and means an inward,
unexpressed feeling of sorrow, to groan together with. “Suffers” is <span
lang=EL>συνωδι</span>́<span lang=EL>νω</span> (sunōdinō) and refers to pain
that is very prevalent. The answer to the curse on the present earth is the
Millennium when the curse will be removed. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For we know that the whole creation groans and suffers the
pains of childbirth together until now.” (Romans 8:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Suffering from Physical Infirmities</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The human body has defects. Congenital defects are those
that exist prior to birth. We can also acquire defects through injuries, brain
damage, loss of limbs, etc. Defects never stop the plan of God for you. These
are prevalent in the human race for the unredeemed and redeemed. These
infirmities have perfect provision in the plan of God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 8:23, “And not only this” refers to nature and
“but also we ourselves” refers to the believer living on earth. The human
body’s defects will be cured through our resurrection body. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And not only this, but also we ourselves, having the first
fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting eagerly
for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our body.” (Romans 8:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Having the first fruits of the Spirit” is the
appositional genitive of <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>παρχη</span>́
(aparchē) and means we keep on having the first-fruits and refers to seven
salvation ministries of God the Holy Spirit: 1) the Holy Spirit is the agent of
regeneration, 2) the Holy Spirit creates a human spirit for each believer
(regeneration), 3) the Holy Spirit places each believer into union with Jesus
Christ (Baptism of the Holy Spirit), 4) the Holy Spirit permanently indwells
every Church Age believer, 5) the Holy Spirit seals the believer to the day of
redemption, 6) the Holy Spirit gives at least one spiritual gift to every
believer, and 7) the filling of the Holy Spirit. Titus 3:15; Philemon 1:25; 1
Cor. 12:13; Eph. 4:30; Eph. 1:13; 2 Cor. 1:22; 1 Cor. 3:16-17; 1 Cor. 12:11.
See category on <a href="#_Holy_Spirit,_Seven">Holy Spirit, Seven Salvation
Ministries</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done
in righteousness, but according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration
and renewing by the Holy Spirit,&quot;  (Titus 3:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your
spirit.&quot;  (Philemon 1:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body,
whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink
of one Spirit.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 12:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were
sealed for the day of redemption.&quot;  (Ephesians 4:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;In Him, you also, after listening to the message of
truth, the gospel of your salvation—having also believed, you were sealed in
Him with the Holy Spirit of promise,&quot;  (Ephesians 1:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“who also sealed us and gave us the Spirit in our hearts as a
pledge.” (2 Corinthians 1:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Do you not know that you are a temple of God and that the
Spirit of God dwells in you? If any man destroys the temple of God, God will
destroy him, for the temple of God is holy, and that is what you are.&quot;  (1
Corinthians 3:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But one and the same Spirit works all these things,
distributing to each one individually just as He wills.&quot;  (1 Corinthians
12:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first fruits of the Spirit is the down payment on the
believer’s inheritance in eternity. The Holy Spirit is the basis of
spirituality while on earth.  In Romans 8:23, “even we ourselves groan” is the
present active indicative of <span lang=EL>στενα</span>́<span lang=EL>ζω</span>
(stenazō) and means we keep on groaning and refers to the believer’s suffering
in this life for many different reasons. “Within ourselves” means that all
suffering is connected with the inner man or the soul. “Waiting eagerly for our
adoption as sons” is the present middle participle of <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span
lang=EL>πεκδε</span>́<span lang=EL>χομαι</span> (apekdechomai) and means eager
anticipation in the right lobe. Eph. 1:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“who is given as a pledge of our inheritance, with a view to
the redemption of God's own possession, to the praise of His glory.” (Ephesians
1:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Christ, we all have the rights of full sons. This is
the adoption of Positional Sanctification. The adoption of Ultimate Sanctification
means that in heaven, we have a new resurrection body. The self-consciousness,
mentality, volition, conscience and emotions can be affected by the body or
sufferings and sometimes you can be reduced to helplessness.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 8:26 and 2 Corinthians 12:5, “weakness” is <span
lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>σθε</span>́<span lang=EL>νεια</span> (astheneia)
and means native weakness and frailty, sickness, feebleness of health. These
infirmities or weaknesses are defects that cause you to be helpless (i.e.,
seizures, coma, unconsciousness, etc.) where you are unable to take care of
your own body’s processes. </p>

<p class=Verses>“In the same way the Spirit also helps our weakness; for we do
not know how to pray as we should, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us
with groanings too deep for words;” (Romans 8:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“On behalf of such a man I will boast; but on my own behalf I
will not boast, except in regard to my weaknesses.” (2 Corinthians 12:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Note that Paul in spiritual maturity had a “thorn in the
flesh.” He prayed three times for the Lord to remove it. The Lord did not. This
thorn could have been a situation that embarrassed him and made it so he could
not continue. Something debilitating like an epileptic seizure would be a
perfect example. 2 Cor. 12:7-8; 2 Cor. 12:9-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, for
this reason, to keep me from exalting myself, there was given me a thorn in the
flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me—to keep me from exalting myself!
Concerning this I implored the Lord three times that it might leave me.” (2
Corinthians 12:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He has said to me, &quot;My grace is sufficient for you,
for power is perfected in weakness.&quot; Most gladly, therefore, I will rather
boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me.
Therefore I am well content with weaknesses, with insults, with distresses,
with persecutions, with difficulties, for Christ's sake; for when I am weak,
then I am strong.” (2 Corinthians 12:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 8:24, “hope” refers to our confident
expectation of eternal salvation based on our faith belief in the work of Jesus
Christ on the Cross. Hope is what is in store for us in our eternal future with
God. We are delivered by hope. “Hope that is seen is not a hope” refers to
eternity, not our confidence in the spiritual life. Hope is a mental attitude
and is the reality of Bible doctrine regarding our eternal future. The human
body’s defects on earth do not in any way curtail that hope or service on earth.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For in hope we have been saved, but hope that is seen is not
hope; for who hopes for what he already sees?” (Romans 8:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 8:25, “hope” is an extension of the faith-rest
life. You apply faith-rest until you are face to face with the Lord. Your perseverance
or patience is rewarded. Lots of things in life are based on waiting. For
example, the Lord Jesus Christ is waiting for the process of time to solve the
Angelic Conflict. Perseverance is a mental attitude and is the attitude of
spiritual maturity where Bible doctrine is understood, absorbed, and applied
consistently. You are to evaluate suffering in the light of the Bible doctrine
in your soul. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But if we hope for what we do not see, with perseverance we
wait eagerly for it.” (Romans 8:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Intercession of the Holy Spirit </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In what ways can a believer be helpless? A believer can
be helpless with mental illness with their volition stuck in neutral. You are
helpless when in a coma or when one is unconscious. You are helpless when one
is in shock but conscious. You are helpless when an imbalance of hormones
occurs. You are helpless when one is paralyzed as in electrocution. You are
helpless when one is delirious and in a state of hysteria or panic. You are
helpless when an unexpected tragedy occurs which leaves one completely speechless,
unable to think.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A coma, a seizure, or being unconscious are all part of
the undeserved suffering package. Instead of healing the situation, God gives
an extra measure of grace and is thereby glorified. This is beyond your prayer,
the Holy Spirit is praying. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Just as the mentally ill person has a provision for no
responsibility when they are in neutral volition, to flush the soul, so the
physical defect of body is provided for by the prayers of the indwelling Holy
Spirit. The Holy Spirit intercedes for us and protects us as He indwells our
bodies. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The plan of God is greater than the worst suffering life
can offer. Grace is always in view in suffering. For the believer who confesses
sin to God the Father and is again filled with the Holy Spirit and applying
Bible doctrine to the situation, cursing of divine discipline is turned to
blessing. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 8:26, “In the same way” is <span lang=EL>ω</span>̔<span
lang=EL>σαυ</span>́<span lang=EL>τως</span> (hōsautōs) in the Greek and means
in like manner, likewise. This indicates that the ministry of the Holy Spirit
is distinct from and greater than the groaning of creation and believers. It is
far superior! “Helps” is a triple compound verb <span lang=EL>συναντιλαμβα</span>́<span
lang=EL>νομαι</span> (sunantilambanomai) where <i>sun</i> is a preposition of
assistance, <i>anti</i> is in turn, or in place of, and the root <i>lambanomai</i>
means to seize, to assist. It means to support someone who is in a hopeless and
helpless situation, to come to the aid of someone, to pray on their behalf. </p>

<p class=Verses>“In the same way the Spirit also helps our weakness; for we do
not know how to pray as we should, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us
with groanings too deep for words;” (Romans 8:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 8:26, “our weakness” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span
lang=EL>σθε</span>́<span lang=EL>νεια</span> (astheneia) and means our
hopelessness (in context), our helplessness, to be weak, to lack strength, to
not know what to do, to be impotent, to have lots of inability. It takes
thought to pray, to use faith, to apply. There are times when you cannot. The
principle here is that the Holy Spirit protects you and prays for you so no one
can tamper with your volition when it cannot operate. It is the same principle
as children in innocence when they are not yet able to exercise their volition.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 8:26, “for we do not know” is the negative plus
the perfect active indicative of <span lang=EL>οι</span>̓͂<span lang=EL>δα</span>
(oida) in the Greek and means to not have seen or perceived. This is a strong
negative and is used as a dramatic present. The soul is not functioning
(self-consciousness, mentality, etc.). “How to pray as we should” is the future
middle indicative and means the Holy Spirit benefits us when we cannot benefit
ourselves. Prayer from the believer would only be beneficial when the believer
can think, but when that is knocked out, the Holy Spirit takes over.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Pray” is <span lang=EL>προσευ</span>́<span lang=EL>χομαι</span>
(proseuchomai) and means the Holy Spirit is face to face with the Father in
intercession for us! The believer cannot confess their sins and they just
cannot function! In this situation, the Holy Spirit takes over. The principle
here is that you may come out of a period of suffering, not because you know
doctrine, but because of the great unseen ministry of the Holy Spirit praying
from inside the believer.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 8:26, “but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us”
is the present active indicative of  <span lang=EL>υ</span>̔<span lang=EL>περεντυγχα</span>́<span
lang=EL>νω</span> (huperentugchanō) and means to plead continually on behalf
of one who is helpless. This word is only used once in the New Testament. “With
groanings too deep for words” means unutterable groanings. The content of the
prayer is not given, but the prayer is offered by the Holy Spirit from inside
of the believer. You do not pray to the Holy Spirit or to Jesus Christ, only to
the Father.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 8:27, it is God the Father who answers the
prayer. “He who searches” is the present active participle of <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span
lang=EL>ρευνα</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (ereunaō) and means to search, to
examine and the refers to God the Father who keeps on searching and examining.
The Father examines the believer’s spiritual growth and coordinates the
intercession furthering the will of God. The Father knows when you can think
and when you cannot. The Father keeps track of our soul and knows when it is in
shock, in neutral, or in the throes of mental or severe physical illness. “The
hearts” is <span lang=EL>καρδι</span>́<span lang=EL>α</span> (kardia) and
refers to the right lobe of the soul and “knows” is the perfect tense used as a
present of <span lang=EL>οι</span>̓͂<span lang=EL>δα</span> (oida) and means
that God the Father understands the prayers of God the Holy Spirit. </p>

<p class=Verses>“and He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the
Spirit is, because He intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.”
(Romans 8:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“The mind of the Spirit” refers to prayer as is mental
communication, but thoughts were behind those words. “Because He intercedes” is
the present active indicative of <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>ντυγχα</span>́<span
lang=EL>νω</span> (entugchanō) and means He keeps on making intercession. This
is a continuous ministry of the Holy Spirit. He is faithful in all generations
of believers. “According” is <span lang=EL>κατα</span>́ (kata) and means it is
according to the norm or standard of Bible doctrine, God’s thinking. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A defective physical body cannot deter the God's grace
plan for you. The believer need not be hindered with undeserved suffering. Even
the earth is cursed. Your body is defective. All things work together for good.
The “all things” are the complete picture. Cursing is turned into blessing in
God’s plan. Even the earth will be delivered from its curse, your body from its
curse, but in the meantime, we are to live our lives as unto the Lord. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Believer’s Mental Attitude Under Suffering</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The basic mental attitude and orientation to any
suffering in life is the Romans 8:28 passage. Anytime a believer is put into a
position where they cannot utilize God's grace resources, Romans 8:28 still
holds title because of this.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And we know that God causes all things to work together for
good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.”
(Romans 8:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer is to reflect on God's plan for them with
positive volition regardless of a groaning creation and a groaning creature
(you). Rom. 8:29-34.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become
conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many
brethren; and these whom He predestined, He also called; and these whom He
called, He also justified; and these whom He justified, He also glorified. What
then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who is against us? He who
did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him over for us all, how will He not
also with Him freely give us all things? Who will bring a charge against God's
elect? God is the one who justifies; who is the one who condemns? Christ Jesus
is He who died, yes, rather who was raised, who is at the right hand of God,
who also intercedes for us.” (Romans 8:29-34, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If God be for us, can a tortured creation and a tortured
body be against you? Rom. 8:31.</p>

<p class=Verses>“What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who
is against us?” (Romans 8:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s plan exhibited in love has left no stone unturned
in giving you perfect provision. John 3:16; Rom. 8:35-39.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For God so loved the world, that He gave His only
begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal
life.” (John 3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will
tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or
sword? Just as it is written, &quot;FOR YOUR SAKE WE ARE BEING PUT TO DEATH ALL
DAY LONG; WE WERE CONSIDERED AS SHEEP TO BE SLAUGHTERED.&quot; But in all these
things we overwhelmingly conquer through Him who loved us. For I am convinced
that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things
present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other created
thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ
Jesus our Lord.” (Romans 8:35-39, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What are you to do when faced with congenital defects and
a near hopeless situation? You are to accept them in the light of God’s will
for you. 2 Cor. 4:7-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, so that the
surpassing greatness of the power will be of God and not from ourselves; we are
afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not despairing;
persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed; always carrying
about in the body the dying of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus also may be
manifested in our body.” (2 Corinthians 4:7-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You are mandated to think divine viewpoint with a faith
that any defect will be dissolved if it must be, to complete God’s plan for
your life. 2 Cor. 4:13-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But having the same spirit of faith, according to what is
written, &quot;I BELIEVED, THEREFORE I SPOKE,&quot; we also believe, therefore
we also speak, knowing that He who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also
with Jesus and will present us with you. For all things are for your sakes, so
that the grace which is spreading to more and more people may cause the giving
of thanks to abound to the glory of God. Therefore we do not lose heart, but
though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by
day. For momentary, light affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of
glory far beyond all comparison, while we look not at the things which are
seen, but at the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are
temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.” (2 Corinthians
4:13-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You are to realize that groaning and death do not flaw
God’s plan for you. 2 Cor. 5:1; 2 Cor. 5:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For we know that if the earthly tent which is our house is
torn down, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in
the heavens.” (2 Corinthians 5:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For indeed while we are in this tent, we groan, being
burdened, because we do not want to be unclothed but to be clothed, so that
what is mortal will be swallowed up by life.” (2 Corinthians 5:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You are to watching God turn cursing into blessing. You
are mandated to grow in grace and knowledge of Jesus Christ - to reach
spiritual maturity as your priority in life. 2 Peter 3:18; Rom. 8:28. </p>

<p class=Verses>“but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory, both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.”
(2 Peter 3:18, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“And we know that God causes all things to work together for
good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.”
(Romans 8:28, NASB)</p>
