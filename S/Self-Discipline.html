<h2>Self-Discipline</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has graciously provided the apparatus for the
believer’s self-discipline. God has provided the canon of Scripture, a local
church teaching Bible doctrine, a pastor-teacher who knows and uses the
original languages daily and on a priority system, the indwelling Holy Spirit,
the human spirit, the apparatus for proper circulation of Bible doctrine and
the proper discipline for erring believers. Rom. 8:16; Eph. 4:12-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are
children of God,”  (Romans 8:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“for the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to
the building up of the body of Christ; until we all attain to the unity of the
faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure
of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ.”  (Ephesians 4:12-13,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The bulk of the Bible is written to mature believers and
to help them grow spiritually and to keep them from reversionism. Therefore,
the whole counsel of God must be mastered.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Several Greek words express self-discipline in the Bible.
This first word is <span lang=EL>υ</span>̔<span lang=EL>πομε</span>́<span
lang=EL>νω</span> (hupomenō) and denotes staying under authority, remaining
under a tough situation though the flesh screams. The supreme example of
self-discipline is Jesus Christ on the Cross. It is translated endure in Hebrews
12:2-3. Our Lord endured the Cross and endured hostility of sinners. </p>

<p class=Verses>“fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith,
who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has
sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. For consider Him who has
endured such hostility by sinners against Himself, so that you will not grow
weary and lose heart.”  (Hebrews 12:2-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This second word is <span lang=EL>παιδει</span>́<span
lang=EL>α</span> (paideia) in Hebrews 12:6-7 and is a tough authority word,
authority with teeth. The believer will endure divine discipline. In Titus 2:12,
it is translated as instructing us.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“FOR THOSE WHOM THE LORD LOVES HE DISCIPLINES, AND HE SCOURGES
EVERY SON WHOM HE RECEIVES.” It is for discipline that you endure; God deals
with you as with sons; for what son is there whom his father does not
discipline?”  (Hebrews 12:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires and to
live sensibly, righteously and godly in the present age,”  (Titus 2:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The verb form <span lang=EL>παιδευ</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(paideuō) in Revelation 3:19 and Hebrews 12:10 means to discipline, to hit
with blows, to whip, to punish, to assign punishment. Luke 23:16; Luke 23:22. </p>

<p class=Verses>“ ‘Those whom I love, I reprove and discipline; therefore be
zealous and repent. “  (Revelation 3:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to
them, but He disciplines us for our good, so that we may share His holiness.” 
(Hebrews 12:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““Therefore I will punish Him and release Him.”“  (Luke 23:16,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And he said to them the third time, “Why, what evil has this
man done? I have found in Him no guilt demanding death; therefore I will punish
Him and release Him.”“  (Luke 23:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The third word is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>ρνε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ομαι</span> (arneomai) found in Luke 9:23 and Titus 2:12 and means to
deny, to reject, to refuse something offered.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“And He was saying to them all, “If anyone wishes to come after
Me, he must deny himself, and take up his cross daily and follow Me. “  (Luke
9:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires and to
live sensibly, righteously and godly in the present age,”  (Titus 2:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fourth word is in Luke 9:23 in the phrase “take up
his cross daily” is <span lang=EL>αι</span>̓́<span lang=EL>ρω</span> (airō)
and means to take upon one’s self and carry what has been raised up, to bear. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And He was saying to them all, “If anyone wishes to come after
Me, he must deny himself, and take up his cross daily and follow Me. “  (Luke
9:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This fifth word is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>κολουθε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (akoloutheō) and means to follow one who precedes, one going
the same way, join him as his attendant, to accompany him. This word is used 77
times in the gospels for following Christ. Matt. 4:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Immediately they left their nets and followed Him.”  (Matthew
4:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Tests for Self-discipline</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Punctuality. Punctuality is a matter of discipline. God
is punctual, the human race is a day late and a dollar short. Gal. 4:4-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His
Son, born of a woman, born under the Law, so that He might redeem those who
were under the Law, that we might receive the adoption as sons.”  (Galatians
4:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Endurance. In James 1:12, the Greek word for “perseveres”
is the present active indicative of <span lang=EL>ὑπομένω</span> (hupomenō)
and means patience and endurance under pressure.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Blessed is a man who perseveres under trial; for once he has
been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to
those who love Him.”  (James 1:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Daily routine without absenteeism. Heb. 3:13; Heb. 10:25;
Prov. 8; Eccl. 12:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But encourage one another day after day, as long as it is
still called “Today,” so that none of you will be hardened by the deceitfulness
of sin.”  (Hebrews 3:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of
some, but encouraging one another; and all the more as you see the day drawing
near.”  (Hebrews 10:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth, before
the evil days come and the years draw near when you will say, “I have no
delight in them”;”  (Ecclesiastes 12:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Minimum of sickness. 1 Cor. 11:30; 1 Tim. 5:23; 3 John
1:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason many among you are weak and sick, and a number
sleep.”  (1 Corinthians 11:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“No longer drink water exclusively, but use a little wine for
the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments.”  (1 Timothy 5:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Beloved, I pray that in all respects you may prosper and be in
good health, just as your soul prospers.”  (3 John 1:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Maximum concentration. The Greek word is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span
lang=EL>τενι</span>́<span lang=EL>ζω</span> (atenizō) and means strained,
intent, stretched forth. Strain is to look fixedly, gaze, fasten one’s eyes
upon. Luke 4:20. Peter demanded concentration in Acts 3:4. The Jerusalem
council looking steadfastly on Stephen in Acts 6:15. The concentration of Peter
is evident in Acts 11:6. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And He closed the book, gave it back to the attendant and sat
down; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on Him.”  (Luke 4:20,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But Peter, along with John, fixed his gaze on him and said, “Look
at us!”“  (Acts 3:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And fixing their gaze on him, all who were sitting in the
Council saw his face like the face of an angel.”  (Acts 6:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and when I had fixed my gaze on it and was observing it I saw
the four-footed animals of the earth and the wild beasts and the crawling
creatures and the birds of the air.”  (Acts 11:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Contentment. In 1 Timothy 6:6-8, the future passive indicative
of <span lang=EL>αὐτάρκεια</span> (autarkeia) means being satisfied with what
you have. You don’t take anything for granted. Your desires are simple, you are
easy to please, you are relaxed and teachable.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But godliness actually is a means of great gain when
accompanied by contentment. For we have brought nothing into the world, so we
cannot take anything out of it either. If we have food and covering, with these
we shall be content.”  (1 Timothy 6:6-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Objectivity. In Acts 24:22, <span lang=EL>διαγινω</span>́<span
lang=EL>σκω</span> (diaginōskō) means to distinguish, to know accurately, to
ascertain exactly. Used in a legal sense it is to examine, to determine, to
decide. God gives you this pure knowledge. It is outside of yourself, therefore
objective. <i>Gnosis</i> in the objective sense is divine viewpoint. <i>Gnosis</i>
in the subjective sense is human viewpoint. To think from an absolute.
Therefore, objectivity is thinking divine viewpoint. Thinking divine viewpoint
keeps you from subjectivity which is human viewpoint thinking and action. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But Felix, having a more exact knowledge about the Way, put
them off, saying, “When Lysias the commander comes down, I will decide your
case.”“  (Acts 24:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Results of Subjectivity</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Timothy 3:1-2, “lovers of self” is <span lang=EL>φι</span>́<span
lang=EL>λαυτος</span> (philautos) in the Greek and means rapport with oneself,
loving oneself, selfish. You are No. l, not the Lord Jesus Christ. “Lovers of
money” is <span lang=EL>φιλα</span>́<span lang=EL>ργυρος</span> (philarguros)
in the Greek and means love of money. 1 Tim. 6:10. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But realize this, that in the last days difficult times will
come. For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant,
revilers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy,”  (2 Timothy 3:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil, and some
by longing for it have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with
many griefs.”  (1 Timothy 6:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the
truth.”  (2 Timothy 3:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Self-discipline is a Balance</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Self-discipline results in a balance of grace
orientation, mastery of the details of life, relaxed mental attitude, capacity
for love, and sharing the happiness of God. Balance your time by ruling it and
making it your slave. The timing of time. Eccl. 3:1-9. The planning of time.
James 4. The redeeming of time. Eph. 5. The utilization of time. Time is short.
Legitimate living can hinder redemption of time. Abused time is misused time. 1
Cor. 7:29-31.</p>

<p class=Verses>“There is an appointed time for everything. And there is a time
for every event under heaven— A time to give birth and a time to die; A time to
plant and a time to uproot what is planted. A time to kill and a time to heal;
A time to tear down and a time to build up. A time to weep and a time to laugh;
A time to mourn and a time to dance. A time to throw stones and a time to
gather stones; A time to embrace and a time to shun embracing. A time to search
and a time to give up as lost; A time to keep and a time to throw away. A time
to tear apart and a time to sew together; A time to be silent and a time to
speak. A time to love and a time to hate; A time for war and a time for peace.
What profit is there to the worker from that in which he toils?”  (Ecclesiastes
3:1-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But this I say, brethren, the time has been shortened, so that
from now on those who have wives should be as though they had none; and those
who weep, as though they did not weep; and those who rejoice, as though they
did not rejoice; and those who buy, as though they did not possess; and those
who use the world, as though they did not make full use of it; for the form of
this world is passing away.”  (1 Corinthians 7:29-31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Self-discipline results in a balancing of speech and
neighborliness. Prov. 25:15; Prov. 25:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“By forbearance a ruler may be persuaded, And a soft tongue
breaks the bone.”  (Proverbs 25:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Let your foot rarely be in your neighbor’s house, Or he will
become weary of you and hate you.”  (Proverbs 25:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Self-discipline results in respect the privacy of others.
It is easier to be friends from a distance than friends next door. Don’t
smother them. Proceed on the invitation basis. Respect the volition of others,
the free will of others. Don’t dominate. Don’t enslave. Don’t try to
superimpose your volition over the volition of another. Make your friendship
dependent upon voluntary friendship. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Understand the social capacity of others. Some are more
outgoing than others. Be sensitive to the length of time you stay. Yawns,
silence, small talk, body language lets you know how long you are welcome. Know
how to leave. When you are ready to leave, announce you are leaving and leave.
Most people do not know how to do this. Watch the relaxed mental attitude.
Avoid sins of the tongue, gossip, maligning, legalism, and lasciviousness. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 25:18, “club” is a gossipy tongue that
smashes reputations, destroys friendships, divides people, causes schisms,
clicks. “Sword” is an instrument for killing up close. “Arrow” is an instrument
for killing someone at a distance. This destroys friendships. </p>

<p class=Verses>“ Like a club and a sword and a sharp arrow Is a man who bears
false witness against his neighbor.”  (Proverbs 25:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Association with neighbors can be on a number of bases.
Compatibility in divine institutions. He is a conservative and so are you.
Compatibility in personality and interest. Compatibility because of
geographical location, background. Both from Kansas, both Germans, etc.
Compatibility because both have children the same age. Compatibility because
both go to the same church. Compatibility on a doctrinal basis and both of you
are positive. Rapport on a doctrinal basis.</p>

appetite.”  (Proverbs 23:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do not be with heavy drinkers of wine, Or with gluttonous
eaters of meat; For the heavy drinker and the glutton will come to poverty, And
drowsiness will clothe one with rags.”  (Proverbs 23:20-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Self-discipline results in a balancing sleeping, leisure
time, and work. Exercising well and working hard to sleep well. Being
motivated, self-disciplined in work. Prov. 26:14; Prov. 24:30-34.</p>

<p class=Verses>“ As the door turns on its hinges, So does the sluggard on his
bed.”  (Proverbs 26:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“I passed by the field of the sluggard And by the vineyard of
the man lacking sense, And behold, it was completely overgrown with thistles;
Its surface was covered with nettles, And its stone wall was broken down. When
I saw, I reflected upon it; I looked, and received instruction. “A little
sleep, a little slumber, A little folding of the hands to rest,” Then your
poverty will come as a robber And your want like an armed man.”  (Proverbs
24:30-34, NASB)</p>
