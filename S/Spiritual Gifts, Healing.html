<h2>Spiritual Gifts, Healing</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The temporary spiritual gift of healing was the ability
to heal at will. The purpose of the gift of healing was not just to alleviate
human suffering. It was the ability to heal people with all kinds of diseases
to provide a highly visible platform of recognition of their authority from God
and communication of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The apostles and many of their
close associates had the gift of healing. 1 Cor. 12:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;to another faith by the same Spirit, and to another gifts
of healing by the one Spirit,&quot;  (1 Corinthians 12:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The gift of healing was designed to focus attention on
the message of apostles, prophets, pastors, and evangelists before the New
Testament Canon of Scripture was completed and circulated in 96-100 AD. Healing
certified the message of the Gospel with supernatural phenomena. Those who were
given the gift were not required to exercise their faith for the gift to work.
For instance, someone with the gift of healing in the Pre-canon period of the
Church Age could simply notice that a person's eye was red and inflamed. In
sympathy, he could say, “Be healed” and that person would be instantly healed,
whether he believed that the healing would take place or not. The recipients
faith was not required either. That was because the nature of this gift was to
establish the authority of the apostles or close associates. People would see
tremendous wonders and pay attention to the message being communicated. Acts
19:11-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;God was performing extraordinary miracles by the hands of
Paul, so that handkerchiefs or aprons were even carried from his body to the
sick, and the diseases left them and the evil spirits went out.&quot;  (Acts
19:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The gift of healing was closely related to the gift of
miracles. Although they were different, they both were supernatural. A man with
the gift of healing could heal at will. He could heal anyone at any time he
chose to do so. Many with this gift had the gift of miracles as well. Healing
does not exist today as a spiritual gift because it ceased with the completion
of the New Testament Canon of Scripture as did all other temporary spiritual
gifts. 1 Cor. 13:10. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;but when the perfect comes, the partial will be done
away.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 13:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Paul’s Use of Healing in His Ministry</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul had the gift of healing. Even handkerchiefs or
aprons that had touched Paul were taken to the sick and their illnesses were
cured and demons departed from them. Why could Paul do that? It was because so
many people were crowding in and he wanted to heal many to establish his
authority as an apostle and the authority of the Word of God. So, through the
handkerchiefs and aprons, Paul could exercise his gift of healing. Acts
19:11-12</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;God was performing extraordinary miracles by the hands of
Paul, so that handkerchiefs or aprons were even carried from his body to the
sick, and the diseases left them and the evil spirits went out.&quot;  (Acts
19:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Once Paul's authority and message were established and
generally accepted, God withdrew the gift of healing from him by 57 AD. It was
no longer needed. Paul was not able to heal two of his closest friends -
Epaphroditus who was dying in Philippians 2:25-27 and Trophimus in 2 Timothy
4:20. He solicited prayer on their behalf, but he could not heal them. Paul had
to leave Trophimus behind at Miletus because he could not heal him.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus,
my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger and
minister to my need; because he was longing for you all and was distressed
because you had heard that he was sick. For indeed he was sick to the point of
death, but God had mercy on him, and not on him only but also on me, so that I
would not have sorrow upon sorrow.&quot;  (Philippians 2:25-27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Erastus remained at Corinth, but Trophimus I left sick at
Miletus.&quot;  (2 Timothy 4:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul wasn’t able to heal himself either in 2 Corinthians
12:7-10. He prayed three times to heal himself, but it didn’t happen. God would
remove the thorn in the flesh eventually. The thorn demon was a messenger from
Satan to buffet him and keep him humble. This suffering for blessing was to
prevent him from becoming too proud from all the marvelous revelations that God
had given him regarding the Church Age and the Eternal State. Paul could not
heal himself. Why? The spiritual gift of healing had been removed. If it was
that way with the greatest of all apostles, it was probably the way it was with
all the apostles.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations,
for this reason, to keep me from exalting myself, there was given me a thorn in
the flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me—to keep me from exalting myself!
Concerning this I implored the Lord three times that it might leave me. And He
has said to me, &quot;My grace is sufficient for you, for power is perfected in
weakness.&quot; Most gladly, therefore, I will rather boast about my
weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me. Therefore I am well content
with weaknesses, with insults, with distresses, with persecutions, with
difficulties, for Christ's sake; for when I am weak, then I am strong.&quot; 
(2 Corinthians 12:7-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>True Healing Today</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Any healing today must come directly from God and not
through any delegated human authority or intermediary. Normally, healing is
performed through medicine or even a tranquil mental attitude so that the body
can heal itself. While this normal healing capability of the human body is a
grace gift from God to us all, it is not the gift of healing.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Healing is not a question of God's power. Healing is not
even a matter of someone's faith. It is the wisdom of God's sovereign will in
individual situations. God heals today only in special cases in which He has a
special purpose, such as extending your life so that you can learn doctrine.
However, no one has the right to take any credit for such healing. The credit
lies with the wisdom and sovereignty of God. True healing also occurs when a
demon-possessed person experiences the demon leaving their body. In this way,
such a person is then “cured.” This method is used by Satan to establish false
teachers. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We have something much greater than the temporary
spiritual gift of healing today. We have the completed Canon of Scripture. We
have the indwelling and filling ministries of the Holy Spirit. We have the
perfect inner peace from spiritual growth. We draw the closest to the Lord’s
grace in time of physical suffering. The duration of our suffering in this life
is just a drop in the bucket when compared to our eternal future. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Many people have unstable, sentimental, and stupid
attitudes toward illness and especially toward terminal illness. Is terminal
cancer too great for the grace of God? Cancer is Exhibit A to mirror the
doctrine of dying grace. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God can sovereignly heal any illness if it is in His plan
to do so for that believer. He also responds to prayers of other believers
regarding illnesses of all kinds. Remember that when the believer’s work here
on earth is finished according to the sovereign will of God, He will take them
home to be with the Lord. Not a minute sooner and not a minute later. James
5:15-16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and the prayer offered in faith will restore the one who
is sick, and the Lord will raise him up, and if he has committed sins, they
will be forgiven him. Therefore, confess your sins to one another, and pray for
one another so that you may be healed. The effective prayer of a righteous man
can accomplish much.&quot;  (James 5:15-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>False Healing Today</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are two types of faith-healers today. There are the
fakers who put on a show to demonstrate their false healing ability complete
with the acting staff to make the show convincing. Then there are those who
cooperate with demon induced illness by “casting out” the demon resulting in
the immediate cure of the illness. Both types do this to deceive people and in
doing so, they promote satanic ideas.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan can be a source of illness. In the case of Paul, it
was a messenger of Satan or a demon. 2 Cor. 12:7.</p>

<p class=Verses> &quot;Because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations,
for this reason, to keep me from exalting myself, there was given me a thorn in
the flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me—to keep me from exalting
myself!&quot;  (2 Corinthians 12:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan produced Job’s sickness in Job 2:6-8. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So the LORD said to Satan, &quot;Behold, he is in your
power, only spare his life.&quot; Then Satan went out from the presence of the
LORD and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot to the crown of
his head. And he took a potsherd to scrape himself while he was sitting among
the ashes.&quot;  (Job 2:6-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Demons can bring on illness. Matt. 12:22; Matt. 9:32-33.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute was
brought to Jesus, and He healed him, so that the mute man spoke and saw.&quot; 
(Matthew 12:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;As they were going out, a mute, demon-possessed man was
brought to Him. After the demon was cast out, the mute man spoke; and the
crowds were amazed, and were saying, &quot;Nothing like this has ever been seen
in Israel.&quot;&quot;  (Matthew 9:32-33, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Unsaved religious people can cast out demons and if an
illness or malady was produced by that demon possession, the victim will appear
to be “healed.” Matt. 7:22-23.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Many will say to Me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did
we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your
name perform many miracles?' &quot;And then I will declare to them, 'I never
knew you; DEPART FROM ME, YOU WHO PRACTICE LAWLESSNESS.'&quot;  (Matthew
7:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>False healing can be performed by false teachers and
false religious people. Matt. 24:24.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;For false Christs and false prophets will arise and
will show great signs and wonders, so as to mislead, if possible, even the
elect.&quot;  (Matthew 24:24, NASB)<a name="_D-Spiritual_Gifts,_Word"></a></p>
