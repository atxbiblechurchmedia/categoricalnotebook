<h2>Separation from Carnal Believers </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Christianity is not a monk’s life. However, we are
commanded to separate from other believers with certain characteristics. We are
to separate from carnal believers who are obviously continually out of
fellowship. 1 Cor. 5:10-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I did not at all mean with the immoral people of this world,
or with the covetous and swindlers, or with idolaters, for then you would have
to go out of the world. But actually, I wrote to you not to associate with any
so-called brother if he is an immoral person, or covetous, or an idolater, or a
reviler, or a drunkard, or a swindler—not even to eat with such a one.” (1
Corinthians 5:10-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are to separate from believers who reject Bible
doctrine and that may be 99% of the believers in some towns. You can tell when
a person is negative to Bible doctrine. This is necessary because they slowly
pull you away from Bible doctrine. 2 Cor. 3:14-15; 2 Thess. 3:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But their minds were hardened; for until this very day at the
reading of the old covenant the same veil remains unlifted, because it is
removed in Christ. But to this day whenever Moses is read, a veil lies over
their heart;” (2 Corinthians 3:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ, that you keep away from every brother who leads an unruly life and not
according to the tradition which you received from us.” (2 Thessalonians 3:6,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are to separate from believers who are in emotional
revolt of the soul as a habit of life and from believers who operate under some
false system of spirituality. This includes believers who make emotion the
criterion and enter into pseudo-spirituality. This would include separation
from the tongues crowd and separation from the faith-healing crowd. Rom.
16:17-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now I urge you, brethren, keep your eye on those who cause
dissensions and hindrances contrary to the teaching which you learned, and turn
away from them. For such men are slaves, not of our Lord Christ but of their
own appetites; and by their smooth and flattering speech they deceive the
hearts of the unsuspecting.” (Romans 16:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are to separate from the fast crowd, the wrong crowd
whether they are believer or unbeliever. 1 Peter 4:4; Prov. 1:10-19; 1 Cor.
5:11. </p>

<p class=Verses>“In all this, they are surprised that you do not run with them
into the same excesses of dissipation, and they malign you;” (1 Peter 4:4,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“My son, if sinners entice you, Do not consent. If they say,
&quot;Come with us, Let us lie in wait for blood, Let us ambush the innocent
without cause; Let us swallow them alive like Sheol, Even whole, as those who
go down to the pit;” (Proverbs 1:10-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“My son, do not walk in the way with them. Keep your feet from
their path, For their feet run to evil And they hasten to shed blood.”
(Proverbs 1:15-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But actually, I wrote to you not to associate with any
so-called brother if he is an immoral person, or covetous, or an idolater, or a
reviler, or a drunkard, or a swindler—not even to eat with such a one.” (1
Corinthians 5:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Concerning the unbeliever, we are to separate from
unbelievers in those relationships where essential areas of Bible doctrine are
compromised. Believers marrying unbelievers is prohibited. It is wrong to get
involved romantically with an unbeliever. 2 Cor. 6:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do not be bound together with unbelievers; for what
partnership have righteousness and lawlessness, or what fellowship has light
with darkness?” (2 Corinthians 6:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers should not consider joining fraternities or
sororities with compulsory dating and/or drinking. West Point, Annapolis, and Colorado
Springs are all superior because they have no fraternities.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers should not enter into business partnerships
with unbelievers. This does not apply to corporations. This does not mean that
you do not associate with unbelievers or do business with unbelievers, this applies
to business partnerships. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are to mentally separate from human viewpoint
thinking, worldliness. Worldliness is what you think. It always has a mental
viewpoint. Worldliness is becoming a sucker for social action as a solution to
social problems. Worldliness is becoming hung up in liberalism. Worldliness is
thinking that the war on poverty has merit. Worldliness is disrespect for the
rule of law and so on. Rom. 12:1-2. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to
present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is
your spiritual service of worship. And do not be conformed to this world, but
be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the
will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect.” (Romans 12:1-2,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are to separate from religion and apostacy where the
human viewpoint of life is substituted for the divine viewpoint of life. This
includes human dynamic gimmicks and satanic power when tongues and healing are
involved. 2 Cor. 6:17; 2 Tim. 3:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Therefore, COME OUT FROM THEIR MIDST AND BE
SEPARATE,&quot; says the Lord. &quot;AND DO NOT TOUCH WHAT IS UNCLEAN; And I
will welcome you.” (2 Corinthians 6:17, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“holding to a form of godliness, although they have denied its
power; Avoid such men as these.” (2 Timothy 3:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Religion and apostacy deny the power of God's Word. They
deny the power of God in the ministry of the filling of the Holy Spirit.
Believers are to keep on separating from or avoiding these people for their own
benefit. Heb. 4:12; Eph. 5:18; 2 Tim. 3:5. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any
two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of
both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the
heart.” (Hebrews 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but
be filled with the Spirit,” (Ephesians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“holding to a form of godliness, although they have denied its
power; Avoid such men as these.” (2 Timothy 3:5, NASB)</p>
