<h2><a name="_D-Scar_Tissue_of"></a><a name="_Scar_Tissue_of"></a>Scar Tissue
of the Soul</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scar tissue is the residue or callous formed on the
facets of the soul through negative volition towards the Word of God, Bible
doctrine. Scriptural phrases for scar tissue of the soul include; futility of
their mind, darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life of God,
ignorance, hardness of heart, hypocrisy of liars seared in their own conscience.
This is very severe. Eph. 4:17-18; 1 Tim. 4:2. See categories on <a
href="#_D-The_Soul">The Soul </a>and <a href="#_Right_Lobe_Compartments">The
Right Lobe of the Soul</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So this I say, and affirm together with the Lord, that you
walk no longer just as the Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their mind,
being darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life of God because of
the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart;” 
(Ephesians 4:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will
fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and doctrines
of demons, by means of the hypocrisy of liars seared in their own conscience as
with a branding iron,”  (1 Timothy 4:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scar tissue is built up in the soul by means of negative
volition toward Bible doctrine. This in turn opens a vacuum. The Greek word <span
lang=EL>ματαιο</span>́<span lang=EL>της</span> (mataiotēs) in Ephesians 4:17
is translated “futility” and means what is devoid of truth and appropriateness,
perverseness, depravity. This is the emptiness or vacuum in the soul sucking in
darkness, legalism, and the evil of Satan’s world system. </p>

<p class=Verses>“So this I say, and affirm together with the Lord, that you
walk no longer just as the Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their mind,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians
4:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scar tissue is built up in the soul by remaining out of
fellowship the majority of the time with no intake of Bible doctrine. The
result is continued carnality resulting in mental attitude sins such as bitterness,
pride, jealousy, hate, revenge tactics, spite, guilt complex, etc. This also
can result in sexual sins such as adultery whether single or married, drunkenness,
drug use, and drug addiction. John 2:9-11; Prov. 6:32; Eph. 4:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“When the headwaiter tasted the water which had become wine,
and did not know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water
knew), the headwaiter called the bridegroom, and said to him, &quot;Every man
serves the good wine first, and when the people have drunk freely, then he
serves the poorer wine; but you have kept the good wine until now.&quot; This
beginning of His signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and manifested His glory,
and His disciples believed in Him.” (John 2:9-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The one who commits adultery with a woman is lacking sense; He
who would destroy himself does it.” (Proverbs 6:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and they, having become callous, have given themselves over to
sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness.”
(Ephesians 4:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>David is a good illustration of how scar tissue can
effect even a mature believer. David committed the sin of adultery with
Bathsheba in 2 Samuel 11. Scar tissue formed for a year in Psalms 32, Psalms 38,
and Psalms 51. Scar tissue was being removed in 2 Samuel 12:13-14 even as God
administered severe divine discipline.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then David said to Nathan, “I have sinned against the LORD.”
And Nathan said to David, “The LORD also has taken away your sin; you shall not
die. “However, because by this deed you have given occasion to the enemies of
the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born to you shall surely die.”“ 
(2 Samuel 12:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>David fasted for seven days in 2 Samuel 7:18. David
taught Nathan doctrine in 2 Samuel 7:25. His scar tissue was completely removed
12 years later in 2 Samuel 19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then David the king went in and sat before the LORD, and he
said, “Who am I, O Lord GOD, and what is my house, that You have brought me
this far?”  (2 Samuel 7:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““Now therefore, O LORD God, the word that You have spoken
concerning Your servant and his house, confirm it forever, and do as You have
spoken,”  (2 Samuel 7:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Formation of Scar Tissue</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scar tissue is formed through negative volition to Bible
doctrine and continued carnality that results in mental attitude sins, sins of
the tongue, and overt sins. Negative volition can express itself as mental
attitude sins of darkness, adultery, drunkenness and many others. 1 John 2:9-11;
1 Cor. 6:13, Prov. 6:32, Isaiah 5:11-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The one who says he is in the Light and yet hates his brother
is in the darkness until now. The one who loves his brother abides in the Light
and there is no cause for stumbling in him. But the one who hates his brother
is in the darkness and walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is
going because the darkness has blinded his eyes.”  (1 John 2:9-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Food is for the stomach and the stomach is for food, but God
will do away with both of them. Yet the body is not for immorality, but for the
Lord, and the Lord is for the body.”  (1 Corinthians 6:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The one who commits adultery with a woman is lacking sense; He
who would destroy himself does it.”  (Proverbs 6:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Woe to those who rise early in the morning that they may
pursue strong drink, Who stay up late in the evening that wine may inflame
them! Their banquets are accompanied by lyre and harp, by tambourine and flute,
and by wine; But they do not pay attention to the deeds of the LORD, Nor do
they consider the work of His hands. Therefore My people go into exile for
their lack of knowledge; And their honorable men are famished, And their
multitude is parched with thirst.”  (Isaiah 5:11-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scar tissue is produced by negative volition toward the
person of Christ (believer or unbeliever). You recognize negative volition by
rejection of the Gospel for the unbeliever and rejection of Bible doctrine for
the believer. The Holy Spirit convicts of unbelief in the unbeliever and the
Word of God in the right lobe of the soul convicts of sin for the believer.
Scar tissue is produced in the soul by the intake of false teaching and
anything apart from consistent intake and application of Bible doctrine. 2 Cor.
4:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore we do not lose heart, but though our outer man is
decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day.”  (2 Corinthians 4:16,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Scar Tissue and the Believer</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers are commanded to learn Bible doctrine and to
grow spiritually. We learn Bible doctrine so we can apply it to our spiritual
life. Application of <i>epignosis</i> doctrine from the right lobe of the soul
is in two directions. Application toward God produces a rapport love with God.
We gain a capacity to love God and to respond to Him, thus we are occupied with
the person of Christ. Application is also toward others and our situations and
opportunities in life. In so doing, we gain ability to orientate to the grace
of God and respond to His plan and promises. You can’t learn enough doctrine.
Doctrine keeps scar tissue out of the soul. Scar tissue can keep you from
functioning in the area of your spiritual gift. Doctrine should be taken in
daily to keep the scar tissue out. 2 Peter 3:18. </p>

<p class=Verses>“but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory, both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.” 
(2 Peter 3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 12:42, “Nevertheless many even of the rulers”
refers to the Sanhedrin, Pharisees, Chief Priests, and Scribes. Because of the
legalism of the Pharisees, “they were not confessing Him.” They did not admit
or acknowledge that they had been saved. They kept it to themselves. They did
not publicly acknowledge this and thus they did not learn Bible doctrine.
Jerusalem went sour through legalism. Why? They were afraid that they might be
ostracized from the synagogue. As such, they were piling up pride, approbation
lust, and scar tissue. John 12:43.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Nevertheless many even of the rulers believed in Him, but
because of the Pharisees they were not confessing Him, for fear that they would
be put out of the synagogue;”  (John 12:42, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“for they loved the approval of men rather than the approval of
God.”  (John 12:43, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The greatest tragedy in Christendom today is the
individual who is saved, but because of no categorical teaching goes negative
to Bible doctrine. Negative volition results in ignorance of Bible doctrine.
The principle thing in life and the greatest virtue of the Christian life is a
knowledge of Bible doctrine. Prov. 4:1-9. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Hear, O sons, the instruction of a father, And give attention
that you may gain understanding, For I give you sound teaching; Do not abandon
my instruction. When I was a son to my father, Tender and the only son in the
sight of my mother, Then he taught me and said to me, “Let your heart hold fast
my words; Keep my commandments and live; Acquire wisdom! Acquire understanding!
Do not forget nor turn away from the words of my mouth. “Do not forsake her,
and she will guard you; Love her, and she will watch over you. “The beginning
of wisdom is: Acquire wisdom; And with all your acquiring, get understanding. “Prize
her, and she will exalt you; She will honor you if you embrace her. “She will
place on your head a garland of grace; She will present you with a crown of
beauty.”“  (Proverbs 4:1-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Most believers fall by the wayside because they can’t
stick it out. They give up, they stop plugging, they lose interest, or the
details of life come fast and furious and boredom sets in, entertainment
becomes a priority, and apostacy results. Isaiah 28:10-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>““For He says, ‘Order on order, order on order, Line on line,
line on line, A little here, a little there.’“ Indeed, He will speak to this
people Through stammering lips and a foreign tongue, He who said to them, “Here
is rest, give rest to the weary,” And, “Here is repose,” but they would not
listen. So the word of the LORD to them will be, “Order on order, order on
order, Line on line, line on line, A little here, a little there,” That they
may go and stumble backward, be broken, snared and taken captive.”  (Isaiah
28:10-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Scar Tissue and the Unbeliever</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 12:39-40, “they could not believe” means they had
maximum negative volition at the point of Gospel hearing. They said no too many
times and filled up their soul with scar tissue toward God and the Gospel of
Jesus Christ. They became incapable of a positive response. They had scar
tissue on their soul and had no human spirit because they were unsaved.
Therefore, it was impossible for God to reach their self-consciousness and make
them aware of Him. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason they could not believe, for Isaiah said again,
“HE HAS BLINDED THEIR EYES AND HE HARDENED THEIR HEART, SO THAT THEY WOULD NOT
SEE WITH THEIR EYES AND PERCEIVE WITH THEIR HEART, AND BE CONVERTED AND I HEAL
THEM.”“  (John 12:39-40, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In their mentality, there is a vacuum through legalism and
through the details of life. Their volition could make a decision for Christ,
but they would not because it was covered with scar tissue. In their emotions,
there was no rapport toward God and no appreciation of the Gospel message of
grace. Their norms and standards were human norms and standards. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What puts scar tissue on the soul? Negative volition. In
this case we are talking about the unbeliever. When you have done a certain
thing for many, many years a certain way, it is almost impossible to change and
do it another way. You pass the point of no return like Judas Iscariot. He had
to either acknowledge Jesus Christ as Savior or take his life. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is also the way a nation goes downhill. The maximum
number of people have maximum scar tissue on their souls. The unbelievers
discard the rule of law, the four divine institutions – volition, marriage,
family, and nationalism, and the Laws of Divine Establishment. People then are
irresponsible and that nation comes under progressive judgment from God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scar tissue destroys the soul. In John 12:40, “He has
blinded their eyes” refers to the scar tissue in their souls. Religion is a
blinder. “Eyes” refers to the perceptive system of the soul or the windows of
the soul. “He hardened” is the aorist active indicative of <span lang=EL>πωρο</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (pōroō) means to petrify, to become hardened, to become
scarred. At the point of Gospel rejection, the result continued on. “Their
heart” means the soul was scarred toward God. John 12:40; Isaiah 6:9-10; 2 Cor.
4:3-4; Rom. 1:18-25.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He said, “Go, and tell this people: ‘Keep on listening, but do
not perceive; Keep on looking, but do not understand.’ “Render the hearts of
this people insensitive, Their ears dull, And their eyes dim, Otherwise they
might see with their eyes, Hear with their ears, Understand with their hearts,
And return and be healed.”“  (Isaiah 6:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who
are perishing, in whose case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the
unbelieving so that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory of
Christ, who is the image of God.”  (2 Corinthians 4:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all
ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in
unrighteousness, because that which is known about God is evident within them;
for God made it evident to them. For since the creation of the world His
invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly
seen, being understood through what has been made, so that they are without
excuse. For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give
thanks, but they became futile in their speculations, and their foolish heart
was darkened. Professing to be wise, they became fools, and exchanged the glory
of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man and of
birds and four-footed animals and crawling creatures. Therefore God gave them
over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, so that their bodies would be
dishonored among them. For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and
worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed
forever. Amen.”  (Romans 1:18-25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Remember that the unbeliever has no human spirit, so God
the Holy Spirit must act to make the Gospel clear to them. In negative
volition, the Gospel information remains unused in the mentality of the soul.
God does not tamper with volition, but God has set up a divine law. Negative
volition produces scar tissue and God confirms that when an unbeliever rejects
the Gospel. John 12:38; Acts 7:51.</p>

<p class=Verses>“ This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet which he
spoke: “LORD, WHO HAS BELIEVED OUR REPORT? AND TO WHOM HAS THE ARM OF THE LORD
BEEN REVEALED?”“  (John 12:38, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““You men who are stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and
ears are always resisting the Holy Spirit; you are doing just as your fathers
did.”  (Acts 7:51, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When you say “no” to the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the
unbeliever picks up religion with its myriad substitutes for the Savior. In
John 12:39-40, “So that they would not see with their eyes and perceive with
their heart” refers to scar tissue on the mentality of the soul so they could
not think or understand because of scar tissue. When an unbeliever is saved,
all scar tissue is removed from their soul. “And I heal them” is used in
reference to the body and the soul where scar tissue is removed, thus healing
the sick soul. The body is never said to be saved, only the soul. Mark 8:36.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason they could not believe, for Isaiah said again,
&quot;HE HAS BLINDED THEIR EYES AND HE HARDENED THEIR HEART, SO THAT THEY WOULD
NOT SEE WITH THEIR EYES AND PERCEIVE WITH THEIR HEART, AND BE CONVERTED AND I
HEAL THEM.&quot;” (John 12:39-40, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world, and
forfeit his soul?”  (Mark 8:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Words in Scripture for “Scar Tissue”</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Greek Words</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ephesians 4:17, “in the futility of their mind” is <span
lang=EL>ματαιο</span>́<span lang=EL>της</span> (mataiotēs) and means futility,
what is devoid of truth and appropriateness, perverseness, depravity. This is the
emptiness or vacuum in the soul sucking in darkness, legalism, and the evil of
Satan’s world system.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So this I say, and affirm together with the Lord, that you
walk no longer just as the Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their mind,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians
4:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The mind becomes a vacuum sweeper sucking in all the
dirt. In Ephesians 4:17, “So this I say” is to make a solemn statement with no
humor. This is a statement that your Christian life depends upon testifying in
the Lord. “You walk no longer just as the Gentiles also walk” refers to their
frantic search for happiness. Gadget and materialism living. The substitute for
the frantic search is to sit down and wait on the Lord and have a relaxed
mental attitude and learn Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mental attitude sins continue to keep you out of
fellowship. Boredom with Bible doctrine leads to a search for pleasure in life
and for happiness. Apostacy results with false systems of doctrine, legalism,
and tongues. You become occupied with the details of life. The average young
couple is searching so hard they aren’t in Bible class.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ephesians 4:18, Romans 1:21 and Romans 11:10,
“darkened” is <span lang=EL>σκοτο</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (skotoō) and
means to darken or blind the mind, to have become blacked out or blackout of
the soul. </p>

<p class=Verses>“being darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life
of God because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of
their heart;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 4:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God
or give thanks, but they became futile in their speculations, and their foolish
heart was darkened.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 1:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““LET THEIR EYES BE DARKENED TO SEE NOT, AND BEND THEIR BACKS
FOREVER.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 11:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ephesians 2:12 and Ephesians 4:18, “excluded” is <span
lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>παλλοτριο</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(apallotrioō) in the Greek and means to alienate, to estrange, to be shut out
from one’s fellowship and intimacy. This refers to being alienated from the
life of God. In Colossians 1:21, “alienated” is also <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span
lang=EL>παλλοτριο</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (apallotrioō) in the Greek.</p>

<p class=Verses>“remember that you were at that time separate from Christ,
excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of
promise, having no hope and without God in the world.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians
2:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“being darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life
of God because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of
their heart;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 4:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And although you were formerly alienated and hostile in mind,
engaged in evil deeds,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Colossians 1:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ephesians 4:18, “ignorance” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓́<span

their heart;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 4:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ephesians 4:18, Romans 11:25, and John 12:40, “hardness,
hardening, and hardness” is <span lang=EL>πω</span>́<span lang=EL>ρωσις</span>
(pōrōsis) and means hardness, to be covered with a callous, dulled perception,
the mind of one has been blunted with stubbornness and obduracy. </p>

<p class=Verses>“being darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life
of God because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of
their heart;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 4:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For I do not want you, brethren, to be uninformed of this
mystery—so that you will not be wise in your own estimation—that a partial
hardening has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come
in;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 11:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;HE HAS BLINDED THEIR EYES AND HE HARDENED THEIR HEART,
SO THAT THEY WOULD NOT SEE WITH THEIR EYES AND PERCEIVE WITH THEIR HEART, AND
BE CONVERTED AND I HEAL THEM.&quot;” (John 12:40, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Also in John 12:40, “blinded their eyes” is the past
tense of <span lang=EL>τυφλο</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (tuphloō) in the
Greek and means to blind, to blunt the mental discernment, darken the mind. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ephesians 4:19, “having become callous” is <span
lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>παλγε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (apalgeō)
in the Greek and means to become apathetic, to no longer feel pain, to become
callous. </p>

<p class=Verses>“and they, having become callous, have given themselves over to
sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness.”
(Ephesians 4:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Timothy 4:2, “seared in their own conscience as with
a branding iron,” is <span lang=EL>καυστηρια</span>́<span lang=EL>ζω</span>
(kaustēriazō) in the Greek and means to burn in with a branding iron, to
sear. </p>

<p class=Verses>“by means of the hypocrisy of liars seared in their own
conscience as with a branding iron,”  (1 Timothy 4:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Hebrew Words</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 6:32, “destroy” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שׁחת</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(shâchath) in the Hebrew and means to decay, to ruin,
to be utterly wasted.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The one who commits adultery with a woman is lacking sense; He
who would destroy himself does it.”  (Proverbs 6:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Scar Tissue From Guilt Complexes</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When you have a guilt complex, you have violated the norms
or standards in your conscience in the right lobe of your soul. The conscience
sends a signal to the mentality, then it becomes a mental attitude sin. We call
it a guilt complex because it involves other facets of the soul. It is a
complex sin. When you commit a sin and confess it, God forgives it immediately.
But when you add a new sin to a forgiven sin with a guilt complex, you are
again out of fellowship.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is no way to compensate. You may dedicate,
rededicate, throw fagots in a fire, and agonize in a closet, but you are still continually
out of fellowship. You cannot kill a guilt complex or drown it with alcohol, or
by joining a club, or by coming to Bible class to get rid of the guilt complex.
Anytime you have a guilt complex about anything, you are disoriented to the
grace of God, the plan of God, and the love of God. Guilt is a sin no matter
how you slice it because God has provided for every sin, every thought, so you
can have perfect inner peace and happiness all the way. The guilt complex fouls
up the soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Scar Tissue Makes an Unclean Soul</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A soul with scar tissue can make a business out of
promiscuity in life or through overt activities. In Ephesians 4:19, “the
practice” means to make a business out of promiscuity, to make a profession out
of uncleanness. “Greediness” is an insatiable, unsatisfied, desire or lust. It
is a search for happiness that is never satisfied. </p>

<p class=Verses>“and they, having become callous, have given themselves over to
sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness.” 
(Ephesians 4:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A corrected translation of Ephesians 4:19 is, “Who having
developed scar tissue, having betrayed themselves to promiscuity, making a
business of uncleanness in the sphere of insatiable lust.” The whole problem of
scar tissue of the soul starts with being negative toward Bible doctrine. That creates
a vacuum in the soul that pulls in the false teaching resulting in soul
blackout that causes you to be alienated from the life of God and His grace provision
for your happiness in the Christian life. You get promiscuous and start
building up more scar tissue. This scar tissue leads you on a frantic search
for happiness and in your search, you just keep building more scar tissue.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Scar Tissue in Man-Woman Relationships</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s plan designed the right kind of woman for every
man. God’s plan designed the right kind of man for every woman. When they
marry, there is a touching of souls with the man as the aggressor and the woman
as the responder. If there is scar tissue on their souls, they can still have a
pseudo love. However, this may result in impotence for the man with scar tissue
of the soul and frigidity in the woman with scar tissue of the soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is no scar tissue in God’s love. His love is always
maximum no matter what you do. He blesses and He disciplines as required to get
you back to His plan for you in the spiritual life. You are missing the boat in
this life if you do not confess your known sins to God the Father by naming the
sin, forgetting it, and moving on. You are missing the boat in this life if you
do not use faith-rest, consistently learn Bible doctrine and thereby gain an
understanding of the plan of God for your life. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some people may wonder if they have found or even married
the right opposite number for them. If you think you have not, then where do
you go from there? The answer is always the same. Get a relationship with God.
This puts you on a true love basis with God. As such, God can overrule your
mistakes, your problems, your sins, your choices and designs. Get into a crash
program of daily intake and application of Bible doctrine. The grace of God and
the renewing of your thinking will correct your past mistakes and result in a
great relationship based on Bible doctrine in your soul and in the soul of your
spouse. Rom. 12:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by
the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that
which is good and acceptable and perfect.” (Romans 12:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For example, there is a guy who has Bible doctrine in his
soul and has identified the woman for him. However, this girl has scar tissue
on her soul and she turns him down and marries the wrong guy. Does the grace of
God overrule in this guy’s life so there is a another right one for him? The
answer is always yes. God knew this would happen billions and billions of years
ago in eternity past. He is omniscient and He is always fair. God does not
punish you for another’s decisions. God always has a plan for you that is the
best possible for you. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Scar Tissue of Esau</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Hebrews 12 is one of the key chapters in the entire Word
of God. The first 15 verses are basically addressed to the believer, the last
14 are to the unbeliever. We should make a distinction between two biblical
terms. Divine discipline is for the believer. Judgment is for the unbeliever.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The case history of Esau, an unbeliever, is very
fascinating. He is often used to illustrate Bible doctrine. Esau went negative
to the Gospel of Jesus Christ whereas Jacob went positive. Another famous
unbeliever was Judas Iscariot. Esau and Judas both regretted their sins. The
Greek word for remorse in Matthew 27:3 is <span lang=EL>μεταμε</span>́<span
lang=EL>λλομαι</span> (metamellomai) and means regret, remorse, to feel sorry. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then when Judas, who had betrayed Him, saw that He had been
condemned, he felt remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the
chief priests and elders,”  (Matthew 27:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Judas was sincerely sorrowful and confessed to people who
had no power of forgiveness and who weren’t saved. A superficial Christian who
has little or no doctrine puts great importance on going to someone to
straighten everything out. They put a lot of emphasis on sorrow for sin, vowing
to never do it again, and so on. In doing so, they are totally ignoring the
grace of God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When you reject the work of Christ, you stand on the
merits of your own human good. But God has designed His plan so that man can
never take credit for anything. Though both Judas and Esau regretted their
acts, but they remained negative to the Gospel. Their sincere regret did not
change their eternal destiny. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If you took Esau and Judas’s names away and describe the
things they did, you would find Christians of today patting them on the back.
Why? Because believers are ignorant of what spirituality really is and what it
produces.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 12:16, the word “immoral” is <span lang=EL>πο</span>́<span
lang=EL>ρνος</span> (pornos) in the Greek and was originally used for a
homosexual. The Greeks were degenerates. Esau fornicated so long with negative
volition as far as the Gospel was concerned that when the right time came to
accept Jesus Christ, he couldn’t do it. He had said “no” too many times. Pharaoh
is another famous unbeliever that said no to the Gospel so many times that he
hardened his own heart and then could not accept the Gospel.</p>

<p class=Verses>“that there be no immoral or godless person like Esau, who sold
his own birthright for a single meal.”  (Hebrews 12:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You can’t love the Lord without knowing a few basic facts
involving salvation, maintaining a walk in fellowship, and spiritual growth by
learning Bible doctrine. The more Bible doctrine you learn and apply, the more
capacity you have to love the Lord. Without Bible doctrine, you have no
capacity to love the Lord.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 12:16, “godless person” is <span lang=EL>βε</span>́<span
lang=EL>βηλος</span> (bebēlos) and means scar tissue Godward, godless, trodden
underfoot. Esau is used three times as a case history for an unbeliever. Malachi
1:2-3; Rom. 9:6-13; Heb. 12:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>““I have loved you,” says the LORD. But you say, “How have You
loved us?” “ Was not Esau Jacob’s brother?” declares the LORD. “Yet I have
loved Jacob; but I have hated Esau, and I have made his mountains a desolation
and appointed his inheritance for the jackals of the wilderness.”“  (Malachi
1:2-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But it is not as though the word of God has failed. For they
are not all Israel who are descended from Israel; nor are they all children
because they are Abraham’s descendants, but: “THROUGH ISAAC YOUR DESCENDANTS
WILL BE NAMED.” That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children
of God, but the children of the promise are regarded as descendants. For this
is the word of promise: “AT THIS TIME I WILL COME, AND SARAH SHALL HAVE A SON.”
And not only this, but there was Rebekah also, when she had conceived twins by
one man, our father Isaac; for though the twins were not yet born and had not
done anything good or bad, so that God’s purpose according to His choice would
stand, not because of works but because of Him who calls, it was said to her, “THE
OLDER WILL SERVE THE YOUNGER.” Just as it is written, “JACOB I LOVED, BUT ESAU
I HATED.”“  (Romans 9:6-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The single meal in Hebrews 12:16 is referring to
spiritual fornication where the act of eating represents salvation by works or
religion. This is the religion of Judaism. Salvation by works is the result of
negative volition toward the atoning work of Jesus Christ on the Cross. For
legalism (Judaism), the Jews are selling out their birthright of the marvelous
Christian life. Their birthright is a nation founded on regeneration. This is
their heritage. Any Jews who reject the Cross are just like Esau rejecting his
birthright. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Esau’s Birthright</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Esau’s rejection of his birthright is analogous to the
Jews’ rejection of Christ in 67 AD. The ritual of shadow worship in the temple
in 67 AD indicated Jewish negative volition. Christ had already fulfilled the
shadow on the Cross. In this manner, the unbelieving Jews of 67 AD in Jerusalem
were like Esau. The complete destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD was a great
shock to them.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Esau lost his birthright, the rights of the first-born
for one meal. In the same manner, the Jews lost their true birthright of
eternal salvation by negative volition in 67 AD. The manifestation of their
negative volition was their involvement in religion – Judaism. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 12:17, Esau is the rejector, in Hebrews 12:18,
he is the rejected. Negative volition creates a vacuum in the soul. There is
emphasis on the details of life. Into the vacuum was drawn the religion of the
Jews in 67 AD.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For you know that even afterwards, when he desired to inherit
the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for repentance, though he
sought for it with tears. For you have not come to a mountain that can be
touched and to a blazing fire, and to darkness and gloom and whirlwind,” 
(Hebrews 12:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What happens to a person with negative volition? They try
to be a good person. They can try to make up for their negative volition by
promoting the brotherhood and getting into some program. In a believer’s soul,
they are aware of themselves in their self-consciousness. In their mentality,
there is the mental attitude sin of pride and production of human good. In
their volition, they decide to get into some program. This is the first step to
apostacy. Their emotions contain no rapport love, just a love of their own
works. They have erroneous norms and standards in their conscience. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A believer with scar tissue rejects the doctrine of
fellowship, confession of sin to God the Father, the filling of the Spirit, the
knowledge of <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine and cannot think with divine
viewpoint. An unbeliever can’t turn around and wade through their human good.
At salvation, all their human credit system goes down the drain. A negative
believer can’t swallow spirituality because to do so would mean that their huge
pile of human good would go down the tubes. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 12:17, “For you know” is <span lang=EL>οι</span>̓͂<span
lang=EL>δα</span> (oida) in the Greek and means to know or perceive and refers
to Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the soul. “Even afterwards” means after
the elapse of years. “When he desired” is <span lang=EL>θε</span>́<span
lang=EL>λω</span> (thelō) which is a desire that comes from the emotions of
the soul. This is in contrast to <span lang=EL>βούλομαι</span> (boulomai) which
is a desire that comes from the mentality of his soul. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He would what? He desired that his life would have been
reversed. There is nothing worse than someone in old age with soul scar tissue
stacked high and they are miserable. They want everyone to love them and to be
recognized. The only thing they can do is baby-sit.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“The blessing” is his birthright. “He was rejected” means
rejection after being tested. A promiscuous woman identifies the right man for
her when he comes along and she wants him. But he rejects her. The man checks
her out and says she isn’t for him. Esau had negative volition to the Gospel
and he received rejection.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 12:17, “he found no place for repentance” is
the negative of the aorist active indicative of <span lang=EL>ευ</span>̔<span
lang=EL>ρι</span>́<span lang=EL>σκω</span> (heuriskō) and means after
searching, to not find a thing sought after and refers to scar tissue toward
God. The aorist tense means that at no point could he discover. The active
voice means he kept on seeking it. Repentance is a complete change of mind with
no emotional content. It is strictly mental. Esau had gone past the point of no
return and it was that way with the Jews in 67 AD. They had eaten the one meal
of Judaism and couldn’t change their mind about Christianity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Though he sought for it with tears” means he sought it sincerely
with tears. Sincerity does not overcome scar tissue of the soul. You can want
to do right, but you can want to from now until doom’s day and never get with
Bible doctrine. “Sought” is <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>κζητε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (ekzēteō) and means to earnestly seek. You can cry all day,
but if you have scar tissue on your soul, you are not going to cut it. Emotion
will not cut anything. A woman can never respond to a man as long as she has
scar tissue on her soul (or vice versa). The only thing that can remove scar
tissue in the soul is a change of mind about Bible doctrine followed by confession
of sin to God the Father followed by the consistent intake and application of
Bible doctrine. Only Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the soul can push the
scar tissue out. See category on <a href="#_Weeping">Weeping</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Scar Tissue is Hardening of the Heart</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The heart is used three ways in Scripture apart from the
physical blood pump. In John 12:40, the heart refers to the soul itself - the
right lobe of the mentality of the soul. See category on <a
href="#_Hardness_of_Heart">Hardness of Heart</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>““HE HAS BLINDED THEIR EYES AND HE HARDENED THEIR HEART, SO
THAT THEY WOULD NOT SEE WITH THEIR EYES AND PERCEIVE WITH THEIR HEART, AND BE
CONVERTED AND I HEAL THEM.”“  (John 12:40, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 14:1, the heart refers to the mentality of the
soul where the unbeliever has said “no” to the Gospel. They have done some
thinking and have no place for God in their soul. </p>

<p class=Verses>“ For the choir director. A Psalm of David. The fool has said
in his heart, “There is no God.” They are corrupt, they have committed
abominable deeds; There is no one who does good.”  (Psalms 14:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Jeremiah 17:9, “The heart” refers to the old sin
nature – the nature of mankind. The hardening of the heart refers to either
scar tissue or some aspect of negative volition to God’s plan and His grace.
The pharaoh of Exodus hardened his own heart. Exodus 7:22-23; Exodus 8:15;
Exodus 8:32; Exodus 9:34. </p>

<p class=Verses>““The heart is more deceitful than all else And is desperately
sick; Who can understand it?”  (Jeremiah 17:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the magicians of Egypt did the same with their secret
arts; and Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them, as the
LORD had said. Then Pharaoh turned and went into his house with no concern even
for this.”  (Exodus 7:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his
heart and did not listen to them, as the LORD had said.”  (Exodus 8:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and he did not
let the people go.”  (Exodus 8:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the
thunder had ceased, he sinned again and hardened his heart, he and his
servants.”  (Exodus 9:34, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Actually pharaoh had the same chance to be saved as did Moses.
We know this by comparing Romans 9:15 with Romans 9:17. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For He says to Moses, “I WILL HAVE MERCY ON WHOM I HAVE MERCY,
AND I WILL HAVE COMPASSION ON WHOM I HAVE COMPASSION.”“  (Romans 9:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, “FOR THIS VERY PURPOSE I
RAISED YOU UP, TO DEMONSTRATE MY POWER IN YOU, AND THAT MY NAME MIGHT BE
PROCLAIMED THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE EARTH.”“  (Romans 9:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ died for Pharaoh and he died for Moses. The
difference is that Moses went positive and expressed it in a non-meritorious
way by faith in Jesus Christ. Pharaoh said no until he was completely scarred
up in his soul and died shortly thereafter. God finally removed all restraint
from Pharaoh’s volition. He only said “yes” to take the heat off caused by the ten
plagues. There was no positive volition response here. He was just trying to
get rid of the pain and suffering. God had a purpose in Pharaoh and in Moses’
dialogue. It was to evangelize the earth at that time. Rom. 9:17; Exodus 9:16;
Joshua 2:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, “FOR THIS VERY PURPOSE I
RAISED YOU UP, TO DEMONSTRATE MY POWER IN YOU, AND THAT MY NAME MIGHT BE
PROCLAIMED THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE EARTH.”“  (Romans 9:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““But, indeed, for this reason I have allowed you to remain, in
order to show you My power and in order to proclaim My name through all the
earth.”  (Exodus 9:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red
Sea before you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to the two kings of
the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and Og, whom you utterly
destroyed.”  (Joshua 2:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is a pattern in negative volition that contributes
to scar tissue of the soul. The Jews of the Lord’s day followed the same
pattern as the Pharaoh of the Exodus. When Pharaoh said “no”, he tried to put
the Jews into slavery. When the Jews said “no”, they put themselves into
permanent slavery, the fifth cycle of discipline. Rom. 1:18-26.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all
ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in
unrighteousness, because that which is known about God is evident within them;
for God made it evident to them. For since the creation of the world His
invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly
seen, being understood through what has been made, so that they are without
excuse. For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give
thanks, but they became futile in their speculations, and their foolish heart
was darkened. Professing to be wise, they became fools, and exchanged the glory
of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man and of
birds and four-footed animals and crawling creatures. Therefore God gave them
over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, so that their bodies would be
dishonored among them. For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and
worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed
forever. Amen. For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions; for
their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural,” 
(Romans 1:18-26, NASB)</p>
