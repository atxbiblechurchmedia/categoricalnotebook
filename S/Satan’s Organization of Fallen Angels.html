<h2>Satan’s Organization of Fallen Angels</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan has a demon organization, an unseen organization
more powerful than any human power. Satan is, of course, the supreme dictator.
Eph. 2:2. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;in which you formerly walked according to the course of
this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that
is now working in the sons of disobedience.&quot;  (Ephesians 2:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are the fallen angels who were involved in
infiltration of the human race in Genesis 6. These angels were imprisoned in
the Abyss and will not be allowed to communicate with any creature nor to come
out until the Tribulation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are also the operational fallen angels who are free
to function also known as demons. These are the rulers, powers, world forces of
darkness, and spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places. Eph. 6:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against
the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness,
against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians
6:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Ephesians 6:12, “rulers” is the plural of <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span
lang=EL>ρχη</span>́ (archē) and means highest ruler, the general officers
under Satan. These are super demons with super power and super responsibility.
The word is used in the Attic, Alexandrian and Koine Greek and is always the
same. How many generals does Satan have in his demon army? This is unknown. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Powers” is the plural of <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span
lang=EL>ξουσι</span>́<span lang=EL>α</span> (exousia) and means authorities or
equivalent to our military commissioned officers. This includes all of the commissioned
officer ranks below the general officers the equivalent of our First and Second
Lieutenant, Captain, Major, and Colonels. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“World forces” is the plural of <span lang=EL>κοσμοκρα</span>́<span
lang=EL>τωρ</span> (kosmokratōr) and refers to world rulers of darkness. This
is the spy system of Satan. This is a special team of demons to discredit and
attack rulers. An example of the spy system of Satan can be found in Daniel
10:13 and is referred to as “the prince of the kingdom of Persia” who is a
strong demon assigned to Persia by Satan. He tangled with Michael the
Archangel. Later, he would be assigned to Greece in Daniel 10:20 as the “prince
of Greece.” These demon officers attack any nation operating under the Divine
Institutions, any important believer like Paul, and anyone in the vicinity of
an important believer like Timothy.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;But the prince of the kingdom of Persia was
withstanding me for twenty-one days; then behold, Michael, one of the chief
princes, came to help me, for I had been left there with the kings of
Persia.&quot;  (Daniel 10:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then he said, &quot;Do you understand why I came to you?
But I shall now return to fight against the prince of Persia; so I am going
forth, and behold, the prince of Greece is about to come.&quot;  (Daniel 10:20,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ephesians 6:12, “spiritual forces of wickedness” is <span
lang=EL>πνευματικο</span>́<span lang=EL>ς</span><span lang=EL> </span><span
lang=EL>πονηρι</span>́<span lang=EL>α</span> (pneumatikos ponēria) and is
referring to spirits of evil in the heavenlies. These are the rank and file
demons who perform numerous evil functions. Some indwell unbelievers to cause
sickness. When Satan calls them out, the unbeliever is miraculously healed so
that many will be confused and deceived. They also push faith healers for the
same purposes. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some control the vocal chords such as the engastrumuthos
demons that speak in tongues. Some manufacture pressure situations against
believers – especially in the Tribulation. They also entice people to do human
good and often to sin. Demons are designed to entice people to sin, although
the old sin nature is basically designed to tempt people to sin.</p>
