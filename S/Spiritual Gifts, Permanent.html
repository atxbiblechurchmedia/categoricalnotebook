<h2>Spiritual Gifts, Permanent</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are two general categories of spiritual gifts -
permanent and temporary. Permanent spiritual gifts function during both the
Pre-Canon period (from 30 to 96 AD) and the Post-Canon period (from 96 AD to
the Rapture) of the Church Age. Temporary spiritual gifts operated only from 30
to 96 AD. After 96 AD, all temporary spiritual gifts ceased to function as a
grace operation because their purpose had been fulfilled. If you have
personally believed in Jesus Christ as your personal Savior, you have a permanent
spiritual gift. There are no exceptions. Every believer is given a permanent
spiritual gift at salvation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Categories of Permanent Spiritual Gifts</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are three categories of permanent spiritual gifts
based on the means of their identification. The first category includes the two
permanent communication gifts of pastor‑teacher and evangelism which must be
identified early because they demand maximum preparation. Identification is not
simple because it demands persistence in the perception of Bible doctrine. It
is not connected with emotion. No feeling should lead or guide those with the
identification of their gift. They must recognize the gift from Bible doctrine
in their souls and have confidence from that <i>epignosis</i> knowledge.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The second category includes the spiritual gift of administration
that the pastor of a local church must identify among members in his
congregation. This gift must be possessed by church officers and some deacons,
especially the chairmen of standing committees.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The third category are spiritual gifts include teacher, service,
helps, exhortation, showing mercy, giving, and faith. They function
automatically with spiritual growth and they can function without
identification by the possessor. In other words, you can have a spiritual gift
that will function without your awareness. Once the believer reaches a certain
stage of spiritual growth, the gift functions automatically without
identification. These spiritual gifts function with maximum effectiveness when
the believer attains spiritual maturity.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>No matter what spiritual gift the Holy Spirit gives to
you at salvation, you are not to feel superior because you have a leadership
gift - it is still a gift. You didn't earn nor deserve it. You are not to feel
inferior either because you have a gift that functions in the background. They
are all powerful gifts in building up the Body of Christ which is the purpose
of all permanent spiritual gifts. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Listing of Permanent Spiritual Gifts</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The order of merit or importance of the permanent
spiritual gifts is based on the authority and responsibility given with the
gift. It is also based on their effect on the building up and edification of
believers in the local church and the Body of Christ. Below is a list of the
permanent spiritual gifts. The gifts of pastor-teacher and evangelism are the
primary communication gifts for the Church Age with great responsibility
associated with them. The third communication gift of teacher is given by the
Holy Spirit to some and is important to the growth of believers in the local
church. Eph. 4:11-13. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and
some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the
saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ; until
we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of
God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the
fullness of Christ.&quot;  (Ephesians 4:11-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The gifts of administrations and service are listed next
as they deal with the administration and function of the local church. Believers
given the gifts of helps, exhortation, giving, showing mercy, and faith affect and
edify other believers in the Body of Christ both within and outside the local
church.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Pastor-Teacher</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The spiritual gift of pastor-teacher is God’s means for
the communication of the mystery doctrine of the Church Age to every believer.
The gift of pastor-teacher is a spiritual gift sovereignly bestowed by the Holy
Spirit at salvation totally apart from any human merit or ability. This is true
for all spiritual gifts in the Church Age. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This gift enables the trained and prepared pastor-teacher
to go directly to the Canon of Scripture and dig out divine policy himself,
grow spiritually based on his personal study of the Word of God, and
communicate Bible doctrine in public after proper preparation. Thus, the Body
of Christ grows spiritually. Only the spiritual gift of pastor-teacher has both
authority from God and ability from the spiritual gift to provide the necessary
doctrinal information for the believer to learn of and fulfill God's plan for
their life. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The gift of pastor-teacher is one of three permanent
communication spiritual gifts provided by God the Holy Spirit at salvation. The
other permanent communication spiritual gifts are evangelism and teacher. The
gift of pastor-teacher and evangelism are given to a small percentage of male
believers only. The gift of teacher is given to both males and females and
functions inside and outside the local church under the authority of the
pastor-teacher. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All kinds of different personalities receive the gift of
pastor-teacher. No one type of character or personality should be stereotyped
as that of a pastor-teacher. Only with spiritual growth can the believer come
to the knowledge that he has this important communication spiritual gift.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Pastor-teacher is the highest communication gift for the
Church Age and is designed to function only within the local church. The
spiritual gift of pastor-teacher will function only for the Church Age. After
the Rapture of the Church, this gift of pastor-teacher will cease on earth.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor is not an administrator. He is a policy maker.
A pastor is a pastor by virtue of his spiritual gift. He didn’t earn it or
deserve it. These are given out by the decree of God and it is based on His
sovereign plan. Eph. 4:11; Eph. 3:7-10; Rom. 12:7. See category on <a
href="#_Spiritual_Gifts,_Pastor-Teacher">Pastor-Teacher, Spiritual Gift</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and
some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers,&quot;  (Ephesians 4:11,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;of which I was made a minister, according to the gift of
God's grace which was given to me according to the working of His power. To me,
the very least of all saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles
the unfathomable riches of Christ, and to bring to light what is the
administration of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God who created
all things; so that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known through
the church to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly places. &quot; 
(Ephesians 3:7-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;if service, in his serving; or he who teaches, in his
teaching;&quot;  (Romans 12:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Evangelism</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The permanent spiritual gift of evangelism is the second
of the three communication gifts conveyed by God the Holy Spirit at the point
of salvation. The gift of evangelism is given to only a few male believers in
the Church Age. God does the choosing and is according to God’s plan in eternity
past. In Ephesians 4:11, evangelist is <span lang=EL>ευ</span>̓<span lang=EL>αγγελιστη</span>́<span
lang=EL>ς</span> (euaggelistēs) in the Greek and means a messenger of good
news. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and
some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers,&quot;  (Ephesians 4:11,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This communication gift gives the evangelist the ability
to gain the attention of crowds. He goes from place to place, town to town,
preaching the Gospel. People get saved through the function of this gift. The
evangelist gives people the Gospel, then basic Bible doctrine and moves on to a
new area. The evangelist must accurately and clearly present the issue of the
Gospel, otherwise gaining the attention of the crowd becomes spiritually
meaningless. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>While the gift of pastor-teacher communicates the whole
realm of Bible doctrine inside the local church, the gift of evangelism
communicates the Gospel and related Bible doctrine outside the local church.
The evangelist is to be conversant with the whole counsel of God. The
evangelist must be able to give an explanation of basic Bible doctrines to the
new believers they encounter.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The purpose of the gift of evangelism is to bring the
Gospel to all nations. The scope of the gift means the evangelist is
responsible for pre-evangelism, evangelism, and post evangelism up to and
including the doctrine of water baptism. Upon performing the function of water
baptism, the evangelist turns the new believer over to his pastor-teacher in
the local church. Matt. 28:19-20. See category on <a
href="#_Evangelism,_Spiritual_Gift">Evangelism, Spiritual Gift</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;Go therefore and make disciples of all the
nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy
Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I commanded you; and lo, I am with
you always, even to the end of the age.&quot; &quot;  (Matthew 28:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Teacher</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The spiritual gift of teacher is given to both males and
females and functions inside and outside the local church under the authority
of the pastor-teacher. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>While every believer ought to grow to a maturity status
that will equip them for teaching, those with this gift who are growing into a
teaching position of responsibility in a local church must pay heed to the
accountability warnings. 1 Cor. 12:28-29; Rom. 12:7; Heb. 5:12; James 3:1. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And God has appointed in the church, first apostles, second
prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps,
administrations, various kinds of tongues. All are not apostles, are they? All
are not prophets, are they? All are not teachers, are they? All are not workers
of miracles, are they?” (1 Corinthians 12:28-29, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“if service, in his serving; or he who teaches, in his
teaching;” (Romans 12:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you have
need again for someone to teach you the elementary principles of the oracles of
God, and you have come to need milk and not solid food.” (Hebrews 5:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Let not many of you become teachers, my brethren, knowing that
as such we will incur a stricter judgment.” (James 3:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers with this particular gift, however, manifest
the Holy Spirit through an extraordinary grace enablement that communicates the
Word of God with power. Such believers would have teaching ministries within
and outside of the local church. 1 Cor. 2:13; 1 Thess. 1:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“which things we also speak, not in words taught by human
wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, combining spiritual thoughts with
spiritual words.” (1 Corinthians 2:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“for our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in
power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction; just as you know what
kind of men we proved to be among you for your sake.” (1 Thessalonians 1:5,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Administration</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The gift of administration or administrative leadership
is sometimes called the gift of governments because it has delegated authority
from the pastor-teacher. This gift is given to male believers only. In Romans
12:8, “administrations” is the present middle participle of <span lang=EL>προι</span>̈́́<span
lang=EL>στημι</span> (proistēmi) and means to stand before, to attend to, thus
to lead. Romans 12:8 presents leadership with diligence which relates to
authority while 1 Corinthians 12:28 mentions “administrations” which can also
be translated as “governments.” Therefore, the gift of administration involves
both authority and leadership in the local church.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;or he who exhorts, in his exhortation; he who gives, with
liberality; he who leads, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with
cheerfulness.&quot;  (Romans 12:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And God has appointed in the church, first apostles,
second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps,
administrations, various kinds of tongues.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 12:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This spiritual gift is held by the deacons in the local
church who hold leadership positions such as the chairman and vice chairman of
the deacon board. Some believers may serve as deacons without this gift, but
must possess the gift of service. The spiritual gift of administration is also
held by those who hold positions on missionary boards, leaders of Christian
service organizations, and those who manage training of children in the local
church. The gift of administration is, therefore, linked to the operations of
the local church. See category on <a href="#_Administrations,_Spiritual_Gift">Administration,
Spiritual Gift</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Service</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The permanent spiritual gift of service is given to both
men and women believers. This gift functions in the administration of the local
church. This spiritual gift is strictly administrative without the leadership
function. The Greek noun <span lang=EL>διακονι</span>́<span lang=EL>α</span>
(diakonia) found in Romans 12:7 means ministry or service and does not refer to
the office of deacon in the local church. Those who have the gift of service
should serve on committees and in specific administrative functions in the
local church, on mission boards, and in Christian service organizations. The
deacon, however, who should be the chairman of local church committees, should
have the gift of administration. Those who serve on the committees should have
the gift of service. The combination of the gifts of administration and service
provide the effective administrative function in the local church. See category
on <a href="#_Service,_Spiritual_Gift_1">Service, Spiritual Gift</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;if service, in his serving; or he who teaches, in his
teaching;&quot;  (Romans 12:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Helps</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The permanent spiritual gift of helps functions by
helping and visiting the sick, those in hospitals, the disabled, and those
unable to care for themselves. In 1 Corinthians 12:28, “helps” in the Greek is <span
lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>ντι</span>́<span lang=EL>ληψις</span>
(antilēpsis) and means to aid, to help. The gift of helps is possessed by a
great many believers, both men and women, and is conveyed at the point of
salvation. This gift is very important because it is the most sustaining gift
and provides stability in a local church. This is the spiritual gift that
really supports all the other spiritual gifts. See category on <a
href="#_Helps,_Spiritual_Gift">Helps, Spiritual Gift.</a></p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And God has appointed in the church, first apostles,
second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps,
administrations, various kinds of tongues.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 12:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Exhortation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The spiritual gift of exhortation is the permanent gift
of exhorting, encouraging, comforting, warning, and advising. Believers with the
gift of exhortation manifest the Holy Spirit through an extraordinary grace
enablement as they come alongside a fellow believer as only the Paraclete could,
the Holy Spirit. John 14:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another
Helper, that He may be with you forever;” (John 14:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 12:8, the Greek word for “exhortation” is <span
lang=EL>παρα</span>́<span lang=EL>κλησις</span> (paraklēsis) and means exhortation,
admonition, encouragement, consolation, comfort, solace, that which affords
comfort or refreshment. Although mutual exhortation or encouragement has always
been the responsibility of all believers, this spiritual gift provides a far
greater ability to advise and exhort others from Bible doctrine in their souls.
Rom. 1:12; 1 Thess. 5:14. See category on <a
href="#_Exhortation,_Spiritual_Gift">Exhortation, Spiritual Gift</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;or he who exhorts, in his exhortation; he who gives, with
liberality; he who leads, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with
cheerfulness.&quot;  (Romans 12:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;that is, that I may be encouraged together with you while
among you, each of us by the other's faith, both yours and mine.&quot;  (Romans
1:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;We urge you, brethren, admonish the unruly, encourage the
fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with everyone.&quot;  (1 Thessalonians
5:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Giving</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The spiritual gift of giving appears to be conveyed to
relatively few believers. This gift is not synonymous with every believer's
responsibility to give as unto the Lord as we are worshiping the Lord in the
confines of the worship service. Believers are to give something from their
finances based on whatever they are able to give as God has prospered them.
This is for all believers. Giving is to be an expression of our love for the
Lord and as a commemoration of God's grace toward us. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This spiritual gift is giving with liberality, which
means above and beyond normal giving. Those with this gift love to give of
their finances to the work of the Lord. They do it above and beyond what the
universal priesthood is able to do. Rom. 12:8. See category on <a
href="#_Giving,_Spiritual_Gift">Giving, Spiritual Gift</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;or he who exhorts, in his exhortation; he who gives, with
liberality; he who leads, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with
cheerfulness.&quot;  (Romans 12:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Showing Mercy</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The gift of showing mercy is a permanent spiritual gift
and is found in Romans 12:8. Showing mercy is an expression of unconditional
love for all believers, but the spiritual gift of showing mercy is quite
different. Romans 12:8 implies that the believer that has been given the gift
of mercy will automatically show mercy, but only if there is virtue love in
their soul through spiritual advancement. See category on <a
href="#_Showing_Mercy,_Spiritual_1">Showing Mercy, Spiritual Gift</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;or he who exhorts, in his exhortation; he who gives, with
liberality; he who leads, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with
cheerfulness.&quot;  (Romans 12:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Faith</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The gift of faith is a permanent spiritual gift. Believers
with this particular gift manifest the Holy Spirit through an extraordinary
“proportion” of faith enabling them to come alongside and help other believers
who may be weak in faith. 1 Cor. 12:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;to another faith by the same Spirit, and to another gifts
of healing by the one Spirit,&quot;  (1 Corinthians 12:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A believer with the gift of faith is able to demonstrate
faith in a group which is under great adversity. While other believers would be
complaining about some situation or circumstance, this believer would exercise
great faith in the deliverance of God and encourage that group of believers to
depend on the Lord. This person would exercise their gift of faith to comfort
them with promises and Bible doctrine. This was the faith that “removes
mountains” in 1 Corinthians 13:2. See category on <a
href="#_Faith,_Spiritual_Gift_1">Faith, Spiritual Gift</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries
and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do
not have love, I am nothing.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 13:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>These are a few of the permanent spiritual gifts extent
today. This does not imply that these are all of them.  Unless you have the
gift of pastor‑teacher or evangelism, you do not have to know what your gift
is.  In fact, you may not ever discover your gift until there is spiritual
growth in your life. You will know your spiritual gift by the time you reach
spiritual adulthood, because by that time it should be functioning and
operational. Without spiritual growth, your spiritual gift will not function. </p>
