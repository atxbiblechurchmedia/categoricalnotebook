<h2><a name="_D-Sins_of_the_1"></a>Sins of the Tongue</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The volition of the soul under temptation from the old
sin nature sponsors three categories of personal sins: mental attitude sins
such as jealousy, pride, hatred, anger, etc., sins of the tongue such as
gossip, slander, and maligning, and overt sins such as murder, adultery, and
stealing. Psalms 34:13; James 3:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Keep your tongue from evil And your lips from speaking deceit.” 
(Psalms 34:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the tongue is a fire, the very world of iniquity; the
tongue is set among our members as that which defiles the entire body, and sets
on fire the course of our life, and is set on fire by hell.”  (James 3:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Out of the list of the seven worst sins in Proverbs
6:16-19, three are sins of the tongue. These are sins where the mind is in
neutral and the old sin nature is in gear.</p>

<p class=Verses>“There are six things which the LORD hates, Yes, seven which
are an abomination to Him: Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, And hands that shed
innocent blood, A heart that devises wicked plans, Feet that run rapidly to
evil, A false witness who utters lies, And one who spreads strife among
brothers.”  (Proverbs 6:16-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Many friendships are formed on the basis of compatibility
of old sin natures because they use the same sins of the tongue. But this is
not compatibility. The easiest way in the world to ruin your social life is to
get together with others and be critical of some mutual target or victim. Work
each other up. One starts with a criticism. Another one tops it, still another
chimes in, everybody is very enthusiastic. Why? They are all shooting at the
same target. This leads to a psychopathic social life. Reversionism is
horrible.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some of you think that it has to be some shocking
reversionistic sin before you can get under the sin unto death. Not so. Sins of
the tongue can put you under very quickly. Sins of the tongue are sponsored or
motivated by mental attitude sins. Pride and jealousy are two sides of the same
coin. If you are proud, you resent someone who appears to challenge your pride,
therefore you are jealous of that person. This leads to bitterness, hatred,
anger, and pettiness. Psalms 5:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“There is nothing reliable in what they say; Their inward part
is destruction itself. Their throat is an open grave; They flatter with their
tongue.” (Psalms 5:9, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Perpetuation of the sins of the tongue or habitual
formation of the sins of the tongue indicate verbal reversionism. Verbal
reversionism can result in the sin unto death. James 5:9; James 5:12; Psalms 12:3.
</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do not complain, brethren, against one another, so that you
yourselves may not be judged; behold, the Judge is standing right at the door.” 
(James 5:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But above all, my brethren, do not swear, either by heaven or
by earth or with any other oath; but your yes is to be yes, and your no, no, so
that you may not fall under judgment.”  (James 5:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“May the LORD cut off all flattering lips, The tongue that
speaks great things;”  (Psalms 12:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is a time to keep silent and there is a time to
speak. Eccl. 3:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;A time to tear apart and a time to sew together; A time
to be silent and a time to speak.&quot;  (Ecclesiastes 3:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sins of the tongue can also produce triple compound
divine discipline. Mental attitude sins sponsor the sins of the tongue. There
is divine discipline for mental attitude sins. The sins of gossip, slander, and
criticism produces double discipline. When it is gossip or slander, you assign
sins to the individual. Whether the sins are real or imagined, the one
gossiping gets the divine discipline of the one to whom they assigned sins.
Criticism does not assign sins. Criticism is an expression of pride. Matt. 7:1-2;
Psalms 64:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“ “Do not judge so that you will not be judged. “For in the way
you judge, you will be judged; and by your standard of measure, it will be
measured to you. “  (Matthew 7:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So they will make him stumble; Their own tongue is against
them; All who see them will shake the head.”  (Psalms 64:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To criticize, you don’t need character; you don’t need
facts. All you have to have is a big mouth! That is all. And an audience! Who
gets hurt when you criticize the pastor-teacher? Who gets hurt when you are
critical of another person? You do. You get slapped three ways. Furthermore,
God protects the believer who is victimized by the sins of the tongue. Job
5:19-21; Isaiah 54:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>““From six troubles He will deliver you, Even in seven evil
will not touch you. “In famine He will redeem you from death, And in war from
the power of the sword. “You will be hidden from the scourge of the tongue, And
you will not be afraid of violence when it comes.”  (Job 5:19-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;No weapon that is formed against you will prosper;
And every tongue that accuses you in judgment you will condemn. This is the
heritage of the servants of the LORD, And their vindication is from Me,&quot;
declares the LORD.&quot;  (Isaiah 54:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God blesses the believer who is victimized by the sins of
the tongue by making them a blessing to their detractor. This is grace turning
cursing into blessing. James 5:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, confess your sins to one another, and pray for one
another so that you may be healed. The effective prayer of a righteous man can
accomplish much.”  (James 5:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Control of the tongue or the absence of verbal sins is
the sign of a mature believer possessing an edification complex of the soul and
functioning in the spiritual life a maximum amount of the time. James 3:2;
James 4:11-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For we all stumble in many ways. If anyone does not stumble in
what he says, he is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body as well.” 
(James 3:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do not speak against one another, brethren. He who speaks
against a brother or judges his brother, speaks against the law and judges the
law; but if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge of it.
There is only one Lawgiver and Judge, the One who is able to save and to
destroy; but who are you who judge your neighbor?”  (James 4:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Effects of Verbal Sins</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In James 3:3, the horse is used as an illustration. A
horse follows his head, so the head has to be controlled. When a horse runs
away, you pull on one reign. A horse cannot run away in circles. A bit is for
the purpose of obedience so that the rider may have authority over the horse.
The horse obeys and the rider is benefitted when the horse is under control. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now if we put the bits into the horses' mouths so that
they will obey us, we direct their entire body as well.&quot;  (James 3:3,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A believer’s mouth follows their thinking. A believer
with mental attitude sins will often express those sins verbally. The mouth is
an indicator of what they are thinking. God doesn’t let the believer get away
with verbal sins any more than He does mental attitude sins or overt sins. The
best way a believer can serve the Lord in a local church is to keep their mouth
shut and only speak when they are in fellowship.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In James 3:4, a second illustration used is a ship. The
rudder is very small compared to the rest of the ship. The ship direction is
controlled by a very small rudder. The effects from a slight shift in the
rudder redirects the entire ship. A believer’s tongue must be under the control
of their thinking and is best done while in fellowship. In this way, the
enabling power of the Holy Spirit controls the believer’s thinking in <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine – the Lord’s thinking. 1 Cor. 2:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Look at the ships also, though they are so great and are
driven by strong winds, are still directed by a very small rudder wherever the
inclination of the pilot desires.&quot;  (James 3:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL
INSTRUCT HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Habitual use of the sins of the tongue are a sign of
reversionism. James 4:11; James 5:9; James 5:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do not speak against one another, brethren. He who speaks
against a brother or judges his brother, speaks against the law and judges the
law; but if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge of it.
“  (James 4:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do not complain, brethren, against one another, so that you
yourselves may not be judged; behold, the Judge is standing right at the door.” 
(James 5:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But above all, my brethren, do not swear, either by heaven or
by earth or with any other oath; but your yes is to be yes, and your no, no, so
that you may not fall under judgment.”  (James 5:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Verbal reversionism produces enough gossip, slander,
maligning, criticism, and judging to destroy an entire congregation. In James
3:5-6, the illustration used is a fire. One spark of the tongue and you can
burn down a whole congregation. This is why Christian servants need God’s
protection. Someone bad-mouths someone else and their friends fall right in
line and can’t think on their feet. </p>

<p class=Verses>“So also the tongue is a small part of the body, and yet it
boasts of great things. See how great a forest is set aflame by such a small
fire! And the tongue is a fire, the very world of iniquity; the tongue is set
among our members as that which defiles the entire body, and sets on fire the
course of our life, and is set on fire by hell.”  (James 3:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Since the sins of the tongue can destroy an entire
congregation, it is the duty of the pastor-teacher to warn his congregation
against them. 2 Tim. 2:14-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Remind them of these things, and solemnly charge them in the
presence of God not to wrangle about words, which is useless and leads to the
ruin of the hearers. Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a
workman who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth.
But avoid worldly and empty chatter, for it will lead to further ungodliness,
and their talk will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and
Philetus,”  (2 Timothy 2:14-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Where people have been properly reared under the Laws of
Divine Establishment (unbelievers), there are certain things they will not do.
Like kiss and tell or never welch on an obligation. Troublemakers are
characterized by the sins of the tongue. They are always nit picking. Believers
are commanded to separate from verbal troublemakers. Psalms 52:2; Rom.
16:17-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Your tongue devises destruction, Like a sharp razor, O worker
of deceit.”  (Psalms 52:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now I urge you, brethren, keep your eye on those who cause
dissensions and hindrances contrary to the teaching which you learned, and turn
away from them. For such men are slaves, not of our Lord Christ but of their
own appetites; and by their smooth and flattering speech they deceive the
hearts of the unsuspecting.”  (Romans 16:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>By avoiding the sins of the tongue, the believer can both
lengthen their life and find great happiness. Stop criticizing members of the
family of God against fellow believers. Psalms 34:12-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Who is the man who desires life And loves length of days that
he may see good? Keep your tongue from evil And your lips from speaking deceit.” 
(Psalms 34:12-13, NASB)</p>
