<h2><a name="_Right_Lobe_Compartments"></a><a name="_D-The_Right_Lobe"></a>The Right
Lobe of the Soul </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The areas for storage and application of <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine are located in the right lobe of the mentality of the soul. They
are:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>The Frame of
Reference </i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>The Memory
Center</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Vocabulary
Storage</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Categorical
Storage</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>The
Conscience</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Spiritual
Growth </i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Wisdom </i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Frame of Reference</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The frame of reference is where previously believed <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine is retained in the right lobe of the soul. It is where new
doctrines enter and are related to previously learned doctrines as they are
transferred from the left lobe of the soul by the Holy Spirit. The frame of
reference is where <i>epignosis</i> doctrine becomes the foundation for
learning more advanced doctrine. Eph. 3:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that
you may be filled up to all the fullness of God.” (Ephesians 3:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The purpose of the frame of reference is; to enable
comprehension of more advanced doctrines, to set up divine norms and standards
in the conscience, to look at life with divine viewpoint, to give correct
content to your prayers, to give accuracy in your witnessing, and to resolve
all of the problems of the subconscious mind such as bad dreams, guilt
complexes, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Application of <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine to life’s
situations and decisions is called wisdom and comes from the frame of
reference. <i>Epignosis</i> doctrine in the frame of reference is the basis for
the construction of the edification complex of the soul. The amount of Bible
doctrine retained in your frame of reference is what determines your spiritual
IQ. Bible doctrine in the frame of reference increases your spiritual IQ and
provides the basis for learning more advanced doctrines. Prov. 4:4; 1 Cor. 2:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then he taught me and said to me, &quot;Let your heart hold
fast my words; Keep my commandments and live;” (Proverbs 4:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“but just as it is written, &quot;THINGS WHICH EYE HAS NOT SEEN
AND EAR HAS NOT HEARD, AND which HAVE NOT ENTERED THE HEART OF MAN, ALL THAT
GOD HAS PREPARED FOR THOSE WHO LOVE HIM.&quot;” (1 Corinthians 2:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Bible doctrine in the frame of reference provides divine
viewpoint and shapes your mental attitude in the spiritual life. Your ability
and motivation for concentration starts with your frame of reference. There is
no way the believer can understand God’s plan or the grace resources He has
provided apart from the Bible doctrine in their frame of reference.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Many believers have been delivered from false doctrine
because of the spiritual discernment obtained from the <i>epignosis</i> Bible
doctrine in their frame of reference. Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the
soul with the filling of the Holy Spirit provide an instinct for discerning
false teaching. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This doctrinal discernment is critical to the spiritual
life because you learn to avoid the false teaching, those involved in error in
the spiritual realm, and phony Christian service which is used to beguile new
believers. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The frame of reference provides the basis for effective
communication of ideas in conversation, in public speaking, in witnessing, and
in social interaction. The frame of reference provides capacity for life, love,
and happiness. The Bible doctrine residing there raises your spiritual IQ and
motivates general learning and understanding of life. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Memory Center</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The memory center is where <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine
is stored such that the Holy Spirit enables the believer into focus on what doctrinal
principles or rationales are applicable to a given situation in life. Psalms
119:5-7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Oh that my ways may be established To keep Your statutes! Then
I shall not be ashamed When I look upon all Your commandments. I shall give
thanks to You with uprightness of heart, When I learn Your righteous
judgments.” (Psalms 119:5-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>While the frame of reference is where doctrines are
stored and classified, the memory center is used to recall Bible doctrine from
all areas of the right lobe of the soul. Recall is necessary for the
application of doctrine to experience and for worship. You associate things in
your frame of reference and then remember them from the function of the memory
center. After a lot of repetition, the memory center also stores Bible
doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Recall is the application of the doctrinal rationales to
the circumstances of life under the enabling power of the Holy Spirit. Recall
has nothing to do with whether or not you have a good memory.  It has
everything to do with the learning and understanding of Bible doctrine.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You cannot use what you cannot recall. You can’t look up
the applicable doctrine in your written notes when you’re being tested. The
divine solutions must already be in your soul. You can only apply what you have
learned. Therefore, recall is the application of <i>epignosis</i> doctrine in
the right lobe to the circumstances of life. When <i>epignosis</i> doctrine is
applied, it is called wisdom or <span lang=EL>σοφι</span>́<span lang=EL>α</span>
(sophia) in the Greek. Lam. 3:20-24.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Surely my soul remembers And is bowed down within me. This I
recall to my mind, Therefore I have hope. The LORD'S lovingkindnesses indeed
never cease, For His compassions never fail. They are new every morning; Great
is Your faithfulness. &quot;The LORD is my portion,&quot; says my soul,
&quot;Therefore I have hope in Him.&quot;” (Lamentations 3:20-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The frame of reference plus the memory center equals the
recall of doctrine. In Psalms 119:109, the young people on that long cruel
march from Jerusalem to Babylon recalled Bible doctrine in their souls as they
were cruelly treated and abused. They had learned the doctrine and recalled it
under the most horrific of circumstances. See the four parts of the category on
<a href="#_D-Maximum_Adversity,_The">Maximum Adversity, The Believer's Triumph</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“My life is continually in my hand, Yet I do not forget Your
law.” (Psalms 119:109, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 10:4-6, the issue is the believer’s
spiritual weaponry to use in defense in the Angelic Conflict. You must have the
right spiritual weapons. Consistent intake and application of Bible doctrine
reveals the grace resources and God's enabling power needed to arm yourself
spiritually. God provides the spiritual weaponry and the enabling power in the
spiritual life. “We are ready” refers to <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the
frame of reference and in the memory center.</p>

<p class=Verses>“for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but
divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses. We are destroying
speculations and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God, and
we are taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ, and we are
ready to punish all disobedience, whenever your obedience is complete.” (2
Corinthians 10:4-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Vocabulary Storage</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Vocabulary Storage is where your thinking develops and
where technical words are stored.  Your thinking depends on your vocabulary.
Vocabulary is developed in the left lobe and only transferred to the right lobe
when believed as part of the <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine that we have
learned.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>After salvation, the believer must learn an entirely new
spiritual vocabulary associated with Bible doctrine and the Word of God in
general. This includes technical theological words required for divine
viewpoint thinking, for application of Bible doctrine to life, and for
conversations with other believers and with unbelievers when conveying the
Gospel.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Children must learn the language and the meaning of words
of the society in which they live. So also must new believers learn the
language of the Word of God to understand God's plan for their lives. This
language of the spiritual life includes technical theological terminology. Matt.
4:4; Jer. 15:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But He answered and said, &quot;It is written, 'MAN SHALL NOT
LIVE ON BREAD ALONE, BUT ON EVERY WORD THAT PROCEEDS OUT OF THE MOUTH OF
GOD.'&quot;” (Matthew 4:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Your words were found and I ate them, And Your words became
for me a joy and the delight of my heart; For I have been called by Your name,
O LORD God of hosts.” (Jeremiah 15:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Categorical Storage</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Categorical storage is where individual doctrines are
formed into rationales for application to life. Categorical doctrinal storage
is coordinated with the frame of reference and classifies Bible doctrines. This
is where technical spiritual concepts or categorical information is stored.
These doctrinal concepts or categories are related to recall from both the
memory center and vocabulary compartments. When you remember doctrinal
principles and terminology, you associate them into categories for application.
Rom. 8:16; Eph. 3:18-19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are
children of God,” (Romans 8:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the
breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ which
surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God.”
(Ephesians 3:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Word of God presents certain subjects in various
parts of Scripture where they are covered from different viewpoints, but are
still part of the same subject. Categories are fundamental concepts of Bible
doctrine. Categories divide the entire Word of God into logical subjects for
understanding, for relating and combining with other related doctrines, and for
application to certain situations and decisions in life. Categories of doctrine
enable a higher level or more advances divine viewpoint thinking in the
spiritual life. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Both vocabulary and categorical storage are essential to
spiritual growth and the execution of God’s plan. In Proverbs 2:2 and Proverbs
2:6, “wisdom” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>חכמה</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(chokmâh) in the
Hebrew and is the same meaning as “knowledge” or <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span
lang=EL>πι</span>́<span lang=EL>γνωσις</span> (epignōsis) in 2 Peter 1:2-3
plus “wisdom” or <span lang=EL>σοφι</span>́<span lang=EL>α</span> (sophia) in Ephesians
3:10. Wisdom is the combination of <i>epignosis</i> coming into your right lobe
as well as being applied from your right lobe.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Make your ear attentive to wisdom, Incline your heart to
understanding;” (Proverbs 2:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the LORD gives wisdom; From His mouth come knowledge and
understanding.” (Proverbs 2:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God
and of Jesus our Lord; seeing that His divine power has granted to us
everything pertaining to life and godliness, through the true knowledge of Him
who called us by His own glory and excellence.” (2 Peter 1:2-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“so that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known
through the church to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly places.”
(Ephesians 3:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Epignosis</i> Bible doctrine circulates through the
frame of reference, memory center, vocabulary, and categorical storage areas.
Without concentration on and positive volition toward what is taught, you will
not develop vocabulary or categorical storage of doctrinal information. Prov.
2:10; Prov. 3:3; Prov. 15:14-15; Prov. 18:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For wisdom will enter your heart And knowledge will be
pleasant to your soul;” (Proverbs 2:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do not let kindness and truth leave you; Bind them around your
neck, Write them on the tablet of your heart.” (Proverbs 3:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The mind of the intelligent seeks knowledge, But the mouth of
fools feeds on folly. All the days of the afflicted are bad, But a cheerful
heart has a continual feast.” (Proverbs 15:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The mind of the prudent acquires knowledge, And the ear of the
wise seeks knowledge.” (Proverbs 18:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 18:15, the “mind of the prudent” is spiritual
growth and acquires knowledge through the grace apparatus for perception. The
“ear of the wise” is positive volition that continually seeks more Bible
doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Categorical storage is analogous to how we group
information in general by putting words into sentences, sentences into
paragraphs, paragraphs into chapters, and chapters into books. It is awareness
of the various doctrinal categories used to communicate information to the
believer.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Knowledge is built on knowledge. Simple categories of
Bible doctrine lead to the more complex categories of doctrine and the
formation of biblical categories.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is easy to mix God's promises with faith in
faith-rest. But to apply divine solutions to a complicated problem or decision
in your life, you must be able to apply entire categories and related
categories of Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Your Bible doctrine vocabulary and categorical storage
are essential for spiritual growth. The technical vocabulary of Bible doctrine
is necessary to understand God's plan for your life and to live that spiritual
life to fulfill His plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Many doctrines can only be explained in terms of logical
progression or mechanics. All Bible doctrine terminology has an associated
technical and theological explanation. Therefore, technical doctrinal
terminology is necessary.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine must be stored in
both the vocabulary and categorical storage areas of the soul’s right lobe.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Conscience</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Your conscience is the place in the right lobe of your
soul for the spiritual norms and standards developed from <i>epignosis</i> Bible
doctrine. The carnal norms and standards are developed from your old sin
nature. Your decisions are generally based on your conscience. Your good
decisions are based on your doctrinal norms and standards. Your bad decisions
are based on your carnal norms and standards. Titus 1:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled
and unbelieving, nothing is pure, but both their mind and their conscience are
defiled.” (Titus 1:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The unbeliever’s conscience functions on human thinking,
but the believer’s conscience functions on divine thinking as learned from
spiritual growth. Rom. 2:15; Rom. 9:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“in that they show the work of the Law written in their hearts,
their conscience bearing witness and their thoughts alternately accusing or
else defending them,” (Romans 2:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“I am telling the truth in Christ, I am not lying, my
conscience testifies with me in the Holy Spirit,” (Romans 9:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer positive to Bible doctrine builds up divine
viewpoint norms in the conscience. 1 Tim. 1:5; 1 Tim. 1:19; 1 Tim. 3:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the goal of our instruction is love from a pure heart and
a good conscience and a sincere faith.” (1 Timothy 1:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“keeping faith and a good conscience, which some have rejected
and suffered shipwreck in regard to their faith.” (1 Timothy 1:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“but holding to the mystery of the faith with a clear
conscience.” (1 Timothy 3:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You must be able to think with a vocabulary to describe
your thoughts. The more developed your vocabulary, the more developed are your
norms and standards. The conscience is built on negative words which forbid
doing something. The conscience of man first establishes negatives and later
develops both positives and negatives. These norms and standards become the
priorities of your soul. Dan. 1:8; Rom. 2:14-15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But Daniel made up his mind that he would not defile himself
with the king's choice food or with the wine which he drank; so he sought
permission from the commander of the officials that he might not defile
himself.” (Daniel 1:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For when Gentiles who do not have the Law do instinctively the
things of the Law, these, not having the Law, are a law to themselves, in that
they show the work of the Law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing
witness and their thoughts alternately accusing or else defending them,”
(Romans 2:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The conscience convicts of evil and wrongdoing. John 8:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But when they persisted in asking Him, He straightened up, and
said to them, &quot;He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to
throw a stone at her.&quot;” (John 8:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You orient to whether you are doing something right or
wrong based on your established norms and standards. The conscience is the
storage area for your norms and standards and priorities in life. Rom. 9:1; Rom.
13:5; 1 Cor. 8:7; 2 Cor. 4:2; 2 Cor. 5:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I am telling the truth in Christ, I am not lying, my
conscience testifies with me in the Holy Spirit,” (Romans 9:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“but we have renounced the things hidden because of shame, not
walking in craftiness or adulterating the word of God, but by the manifestation
of truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.”
(2 Corinthians 4:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but
we are made manifest to God; and I hope that we are made manifest also in your
consciences.” (2 Corinthians 5:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All normal people have norms and standards which are
located in the right lobe or heart of the mentality of the soul. From these
norms and standards come individual priorities in life. Your priorities form
your scale of values. False norms and standards produce a weak conscience.  1
Cor 8:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“However not all men have this knowledge; but some, being
accustomed to the idol until now, eat food as if it were sacrificed to an idol;
and their conscience being weak is defiled.” (1 Corinthians 8:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the early Church, some of the best food in Corinth had
been offered to idols and then sold as the choicest meat in the temple market.
It was biblically acceptable to eat that food, once you sanctified it. However,
weaker believers present with idolatrous backgrounds and a weak conscience,
found eating such food to be offensive. The one with the weak conscience had
legalistic norms and standards in their conscience from their religious
background.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This set up a conflict between those with a strong
conscience and those with a weak conscience. A strong conscience has biblical
standards from <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine. A weak conscience lives by
standards acquired from the believer’s background, which may be good or bad
creating a distorted spiritual life. Eating is a physical issue and has nothing
to do with the spiritual life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer with a weak conscience assumes they’re
strong, because legalism always assumes it is strong. The conscience is very
sensitive and can be erroneous in its concepts apart from Bible doctrine.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The conscience establishes norms for both human and
divine relationships. Your norms and standards are primarily directed toward
man until you become aware of the existence of God and what He has done for
you. Acts 24:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;In view of this, I also do my best to maintain always a
blameless conscience both before God and before men.” (Acts 24:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Your spiritual strength is developed from biblical norms
and standards of doctrine toward both God and man. The spiritually advancing
believer will build up doctrinal norms and standards for serving God while
setting aside false norms and standards. 2 Tim. 1:3; 2 Cor. 4:2; Heb. 9:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I thank God, whom I serve with a clear conscience the way my
forefathers did, as I constantly remember you in my prayers night and day,” (2
Timothy 1:3, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“but we have renounced the things hidden because of shame, not
walking in craftiness or adulterating the word of God, but by the manifestation
of truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.”
(2 Corinthians 4:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the
eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience
from dead works to serve the living God?” (Hebrews 9:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>False norms or standards in the conscience produce
legalism. When God’s grace norms and standards are taught to those in legalism
and it conflicts with their existing legalistic norms and standards, they tend
to go wild and become super-critical. 1 Cor. 8:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“However not all men have this knowledge; but some, being
accustomed to the idol until now, eat food as if it were sacrificed to an idol;
and their conscience being weak is defiled.” (1 Corinthians 8:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The conscience is the basis for patriotism in the
believer and unbeliever. Thus, all patriotism comes from the right lobe. It is
the goal of secular humanism and socialistic thinking to destroy the correct
thinking in the right lobe and thus promote conflict and discord in a nation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer’s conscience demands that they submit to
legitimate authority. Divine viewpoint thinking means you don’t refrain from
criminal activity because you fear punishment, but because your doctrinal norms
and standards tell you it is wrong because it does not line up with the Word of
God. Rom. 13:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore it is necessary to be in subjection, not only
because of wrath, but also for conscience' sake.” (Romans 13:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The doctrinal norms and standards in your conscience
makes your prayers more effective. Paul didn’t pray for people because he liked
them, but for his conscience sake, which is the strongest possible motivation. 2
Tim. 1:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I thank God, whom I serve with a clear conscience the way my
forefathers did, as I constantly remember you in my prayers night and day,” (2
Timothy 1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Your conscience is related to unjust and unfair
treatment. Conscience is the basis of enduring maltreatment and
misunderstanding without defending yourself. 1 Peter 2:18-19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Servants, be submissive to your masters with all respect, not
only to those who are good and gentle, but also to those who are unreasonable.
For this finds favor, if for the sake of conscience toward God a person bears
up under sorrows when suffering unjustly.” (1 Peter 2:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You may not like some people in authority over you and
think they are unfair, but you are mandated to submit to their authority and to
do the best job possible with a good attitude. This is working as unto the
Lord. The growing believer in fellowship has a strong conscience. The weak
believer and often one out of fellowship will complain and reject legitimate
authority. It’s very important to have norms and standards in your conscience
based on <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine so you can handle unjust treatment. In
this way, the believer can apply Bible doctrine to the situation and stay in
fellowship using God's grace resources, thus suffer for blessing. 1 Peter
3:14-16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness,
you are blessed. AND DO NOT FEAR THEIR INTIMIDATION, AND DO NOT BE TROUBLED,
but sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, always being ready to make a
defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in
you, yet with gentleness and reverence; and keep a good conscience so that in
the thing in which you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in
Christ will be put to shame.” (1 Peter 3:14-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The law of liberty and superseding laws are all related
to the conscience. The more the believer functions under the grace apparatus
for perception, the stronger their conscience becomes in utilizing these laws.
1 Cor. 10:24-29. See category on <a href="#_Christian_Liberty">Christian
Liberty</a>. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Let no one seek his own good, but that of his neighbor. Eat
anything that is sold in the meat market without asking questions for
conscience' sake; FOR THE EARTH IS THE LORD'S, AND ALL IT CONTAINS. If one of
the unbelievers invites you and you want to go, eat anything that is set before
you without asking questions for conscience' sake. But if anyone says to you,
&quot;This is meat sacrificed to idols,&quot; do not eat it, for the sake of
the one who informed you, and for conscience' sake; I mean not your own conscience,
but the other man's; for why is my freedom judged by another's conscience?” (1
Corinthians 10:24-29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If you have a strong conscience, you will leave the issue
in the Lord’s hands. Believers with a weak conscience have become negative to
the Word of God and get into false teaching. This destroys the doctrinal norms
and standards and increases scar tissue on the soul. 1 Tim. 4:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will
fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and doctrines
of demons, by means of the hypocrisy of liars seared in their own conscience as
with a branding iron,” (1 Timothy 4:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>False teaching sears the conscience like a branding iron
and destroys it. This is the buildup of scar tissue of the soul. Apostasy can
destroy the conscience. However, you can reverse that by returning to the
intake and application of Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is a happiness based on compliance with the
conscience. There are believers and unbelievers who are happy because what they
do agrees with their conscience. Sometimes self-righteous people are happy
through this. Someone living up to their own norms and standards produces a
degree of happiness. This isn’t the highest happiness, but it is a form of
happiness. 2 Cor. 1:12. See category on <a href="#_Inner_Happiness">Happiness</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For our proud confidence is this: the testimony of our
conscience, that in holiness and godly sincerity, not in fleshly wisdom but in
the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially
toward you.” (2 Corinthians 1:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Doctrine must be communicated on the basis of conscience.
This is for pastors, otherwise communication results in intellectual
dishonesty. 2 Cor. 4:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but we have renounced the things hidden because of shame, not
walking in craftiness or adulterating the word of God, but by the manifestation
of truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.”
(2 Corinthians 4:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Spiritual Growth </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual growth results from having <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine in the frame of reference, the memory center, vocabulary
storage, categorical storage, and developing norms and standards in the
conscience. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Accelerated spiritual growth comes from the application
of <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine under pressure and underserved suffering for
blessing in adversity. We all learn from the suffering brought on by the
consequences of our own bad decisions and resultant self-induced misery. This
is learning the hard way and does not advance your spiritual growth unless you
have confessed your sins to God the Father and regained the filling of the Holy
Spirit.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Wisdom</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The wisdom area of the soul is used for application of <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine to life’s situations, problems, and decision making. The wisdom
area is connected with your memory center. This is the application area. The
wisdom area takes recall of Bible doctrine and applies it to experience under
the function of your royal priesthood. 1 Cor. 1:30; James 3:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But by His doing you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us
wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption,” (1
Corinthians 1:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable,
gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, unwavering, without
hypocrisy.” (James 3:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The wisdom area is where thought becomes action in the
spiritual life. You apply Bible doctrine based on your spiritual norms and
standards. All other areas of the right lobe work together using the enabling
power of the Holy Spirit to correctly apply the right doctrine to the right
situation. This is spiritual discernment. The more doctrine you apply while
filled with the Holy Spirit, the more divine wisdom you develop. 1 Cor. 2:7-8;
Phil. 4:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but we speak God's wisdom in a mystery, the hidden wisdom
which God predestined before the ages to our glory; the wisdom which none of
the rulers of this age has understood; for if they had understood it they would
not have crucified the Lord of glory;” (1 Corinthians 2:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable,
whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of good
repute, if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise, dwell on
these things.” (Philippians 4:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual maturity results from maximum divine viewpoint
thinking in the right lobe. This is also called wisdom. Divine viewpoint
motivates the believer to seek out even more divine truth. Prov.15:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The mind of the intelligent seeks knowledge, But the mouth of
fools feeds on folly.” (Proverbs 15:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 8:1-6, wisdom is personified. Wisdom is
accumulated <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the right lobe that has been
applied to life’s problems, situations, and decisions many times. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Does not wisdom call, And understanding lift up her voice? On
top of the heights beside the way, Where the paths meet, she takes her stand;
Beside the gates, at the opening to the city, At the entrance of the doors, she
cries out: &quot;To you, O men, I call, And my voice is to the sons of men.
&quot;O naive ones, understand prudence; And, O fools, understand wisdom.
&quot;Listen, for I will speak noble things; And the opening of my lips will
reveal right things.” (Proverbs 8:1-6, NASB)</p>
