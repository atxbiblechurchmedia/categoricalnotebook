<h2></a>Youth</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In God’s plan, adults were placed on earth first. One man
and one woman. The first marriage. Gen. 2:7; Gen. 2:22; Gen. 5:1-2. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD God formed man of dust from the ground, and
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being.”
(Genesis 2:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD God fashioned into a woman the rib which He had taken
from the man, and brought her to the man.” (Genesis 2:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day when
God created man, He made him in the likeness of God. He created them male and
female, and He blessed them and named them Man in the day when they were
created.” (Genesis 5:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>These adults then had children. Gen. 4:1-2; Gen. 5:4. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Now the man had relations with his wife Eve, and she conceived
and gave birth to Cain, and she said, &quot;I have gotten a manchild with the
help of the LORD.&quot; Again, she gave birth to his brother Abel. And Abel was
a keeper of flocks, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.” (Genesis 4:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the days of Adam after he became the father of Seth were
eight hundred years, and he had other sons and daughters.” (Genesis 5:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Stages of Youth </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Childhood and youth can be divided into four stages: pre-age
of accountability, babe, adolescent, and mature. Actual ages for each stage may
vary. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Pre-Age of Accountability – Ages 0-5</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Timothy 3:15, “childhood” and 1 Peter 2:2-3, “newborn
babies” is <span lang=EL>βρε</span>́<span lang=EL>φος</span> (brephos) and
refers to a newborn child.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and that from childhood you have known the sacred writings
which are able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith
which is in Christ Jesus.” (2 Timothy 3:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“like newborn babies, long for the pure milk of the word, so
that by it you may grow in respect to salvation, if you have tasted the
kindness of the Lord.” (1 Peter 2:2-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 21:16, “infants” is <span lang=EL>νη</span>́<span
lang=EL>πιος</span> (nēpios) and means without the power of speech. “Nursing
babies” is  <span lang=EL>θηλα</span>́<span lang=EL>ζω</span> (thēlazō) and
refers to the child on the breast.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and said to Him, &quot;Do You hear what these children are
saying?&quot; And Jesus said to them, &quot;Yes; have you never read, 'OUT OF
THE MOUTH OF INFANTS AND NURSING BABIES YOU HAVE PREPARED PRAISE FOR
YOURSELF'?&quot;” (Matthew 21:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 18:2, “child” is <span lang=EL>παιδι</span>́<span
lang=EL>ον</span> (paidion) and refers to a more advanced child whereas in John
16:21, “child” refers to an infant just born. <i>Paidion</i> can even refer to
a teenager as in Mark 9:24. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And He called a child to Himself and set him before them,”
(Matthew 18:2, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Whenever a woman is in labor she has pain, because her
hour has come; but when she gives birth to the child, she no longer remembers
the anguish because of the joy that a child has been born into the world.”
(John 16:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Immediately the boy's father cried out and said, &quot;I do
believe; help my unbelief.&quot;” (Mark 9:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 1:7, “child” is <span lang=EL>τε</span>́<span
lang=EL>κνον</span> (teknon) and emphasizes relationship, father-son, can be
used of any age child, or even an adult in relationship to the parent.</p>

were both advanced in years.” (Luke 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Babe – Ages 6-19</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 3:1, “infants” is <span lang=EL>νη</span>́<span
lang=EL>πιος</span> (nēpios) and is used in a derogatory sense. <i>Nēpios</i>
is also used in the following verses to mean childish, unskilled, simple. Matt.
11:25; Luke 10:21; Rom. 2:20; Gal. 4:3; Eph. 4:14; 1 Cor. 3:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual men,
but as to men of flesh, as to infants in Christ.” (1 Corinthians 3:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“At that time Jesus said, &quot;I praise You, Father, Lord of
heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things from the wise and
intelligent and have revealed them to infants.” (Matthew 11:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of the immature, having
in the Law the embodiment of knowledge and of the truth,” (Romans 2:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 John 2:12, “children” is <span lang=EL>τεκνι</span>́<span
lang=EL>ον</span> (teknion) and can be a term of endearment, but it means here
grow up, to get on to maturity. <i>Teknion</i> can be used for adolescence and
emphasizes parentage and relation. 1 Thess. 2:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I am writing to you, little children, because your sins have
been forgiven you for His name's sake.” (1 John 2:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But we proved to be gentle among you, as a nursing mother
tenderly cares for her own children.” (1 Thessalonians 2:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 John 2:13, “children” is <span lang=EL>παιδι</span>́<span
lang=EL>ον</span><span lang=EL> </span>(paidion) and here emphasizes the younger
teenager.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“I am writing to you, fathers, because you know Him who has
been from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have
overcome the evil one. I have written to you, children, because you know the
Father.” (1 John 2:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Adolescent - Ages 13-19</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 John 2:13, “young men” is <span lang=EL>νεανι</span>́<span
lang=EL>σκος</span> (neaniskos) and emphasizes those older teenagers and
younger adults. Matt. 19:20; Matt. 19:22; Mark 14:51; Mark 16:5; Luke 7:14;
Acts 2:17; Acts 23:18; Acts 23:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I am writing to you, fathers, because you know Him who has
been from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have
overcome the evil one. I have written to you, children, because you know the
Father.” (1 John 2:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The young man said to Him, &quot;All these things I have kept;
what am I still lacking?&quot;” (Matthew 19:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting at the right,
wearing a white robe; and they were amazed.” (Mark 16:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So the commander let the young man go, instructing him,
&quot;Tell no one that you have notified me of these things.&quot;” (Acts
23:22, NASB)</p>

lang=EL>ας</span> (neanias) and is also used in Acts 20:9 and Acts 23:17-18. </p>

<p class=Verses>“When they had driven him out of the city, they began stoning
him; and the witnesses laid aside their robes at the feet of a young man named
Saul.” (Acts 7:58, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And there was a young man named Eutychus sitting on the window
sill, sinking into a deep sleep; and as Paul kept on talking, he was overcome
by sleep and fell down from the third floor and was picked up dead.” (Acts
20:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 26:69, “servant-girl” is <span lang=EL>παιδι</span>́<span
lang=EL>σκη</span> (paidiskē) and refers to a young girl, a maiden. Mark 14:66;
Mark 14:69; Luke 12:45; Luke 22:56; John 18:17; Acts 12:13; Acts 16:16. </p>

servant-girl came to him and said, &quot;You too were with Jesus the
Galilean.&quot;” (Matthew 26:69, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“As Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant-girls
of the high priest came,” (Mark 14:66, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And a servant-girl, seeing him as he sat in the firelight and
looking intently at him, said, &quot;This man was with Him too.&quot;” (Luke
22:56, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 2:43, “boy” is <span lang=EL>παι</span>͂<span
lang=EL>ς</span> (pais) and refers to both age and parentage with emphasis on
age. Luke 9:42; Acts 20:12; Matt. 2:16; John 4:51. </p>

days, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. But His parents were unaware of
it,” (Luke 2:43, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“They took away the boy alive, and were greatly comforted.”

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Pais</i> is also used for girls in Luke 8:51 and Luke
8:54.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 1:21 and Matthew 21:15, “Son” is <span

lang=EL>πατη</span>́<span lang=EL>ρ</span> (patēr) is used for maturity and

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Fill up, then, the measure of the guilt of your
fathers.” (Matthew 23:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;So you are witnesses and approve the deeds of your

<p class=Verses>“And he said to Him, &quot;Teacher, I have kept all these
things from my youth up.&quot;” (Mark 10:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Exodus Generation was Divided at Age 20</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Numbers 1:3, mandatory military service for the Exodus
generation started at age 20. </p>

<p class=Verses>“from twenty years old and upward, whoever is able to go out to
war in Israel, you and Aaron shall number them by their armies.” (Numbers 1:3,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Numbers 8:24-26, Levite males 25 to 50 years old
served full-time in the tabernacle services.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;This is what applies to the Levites: from twenty-five
years old and upward they shall enter to perform service in the work of the
tent of meeting. &quot;But at the age of fifty years they shall retire from
service in the work and not work any more. &quot;They may, however, assist
their brothers in the tent of meeting, to keep an obligation, but they
themselves shall do no work. Thus you shall deal with the Levites concerning
their obligations.&quot;” (Numbers 8:24-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Numbers 14:29, those 20 years old and older who had
prolonged rebellion against God died the Sin Unto Death. The second generation
above 20 years old went to war and Israel entered the Land as God had promised.
Num. 26:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“your corpses will fall in this wilderness, even all your
numbered men, according to your complete number from twenty years old and
upward, who have grumbled against Me.” (Numbers 14:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then it came about after the plague, that the LORD spoke to
Moses and to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying, &quot;Take a census
of all the congregation of the sons of Israel from twenty years old and upward,
by their fathers' households, whoever is able to go out to war in
Israel.&quot;” (Numbers 26:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Numbers 4:46-49, the second generation Levite males 30
to 50 years old served full-time in the tabernacle services. </p>

<p class=Verses>“All the numbered men of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron and
the leaders of Israel numbered, by their families and by their fathers'
households, from thirty years and upward even to fifty years old, everyone who
could enter to do the work of service and the work of carrying in the tent of
meeting. Their numbered men were 8,580. According to the commandment of the
LORD through Moses, they were numbered, everyone by his serving or carrying;
thus these were his numbered men, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.”
(Numbers 4:46-49, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Mature Stage can be Divided </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Ages 20-40</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The age bracket of 20-40 can be considered mature youth
and is one of preparation, especially during times of apostacy. Moses became a
believer at age 39 and was rejected by Pharaoh at age 40. Moses required 40
more years of preparation in the desert in Midian until God could use him.
Moses was then 80 years old. Joshua was 40 when he was selected to spy out the
land. Joshua 14:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the LORD
sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land, and I brought word back to him
as it was in my heart.” (Joshua 14:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Ages 40-60</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The age bracket of 40-60 is considered middle age with
women generally past childbearing. This can be the prime years of ministering.
1 Tim. 5:9. </p>

<p class=Verses>“A widow is to be put on the list only if she is not less than
sixty years old, having been the wife of one man,” (1 Timothy 5:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Generally by age 40, the hard years of preparation have
been finished. The decisions of life have been made and the person is in their
niche. Now the believer is able to have impact. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Ages 60 and above </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/NO/Old%20Age.html">Old Age</a>. </p>

<p class=Verses>“A widow is to be put on the list only if she is not less than
sixty years old, having been the wife of one man,” (1 Timothy 5:9, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“As for the days of our life, they contain seventy years, Or if
due to strength, eighty years, Yet their pride is but labor and sorrow; For
soon it is gone and we fly away.” (Psalms 90:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>But always remember, the believer is to live one day at a
time. That is a wonderful doctrine if applied from the heart. I only have
today, not tomorrow. We have only today and we are to live it to the full which
is the monopoly of the believer.</p>
