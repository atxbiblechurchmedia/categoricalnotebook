<h2>The World System of Satan</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan is the ruler of the world around us. Satan’s
strategy and policy as the ruler of this world is to control believers. Matt.
4:8-9; Luke 4:5-6; John 12:31; John 16:11; 2 Cor. 4:4. See category on <a
href="#_D-Angelic_Conflict,_Satan’s">Angelic Conflict, Satan’s Strategies</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Again, the devil took Him to a very high mountain and showed
Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory; and he said to Him,
&quot;All these things I will give You, if You fall down and worship me.&quot;”
(Matthew 4:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And he led Him up and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world
in a moment of time. And the devil said to Him, &quot;I will give You all this
domain and its glory; for it has been handed over to me, and I give it to
whomever I wish.” (Luke 4:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Now judgment is upon this world; now the ruler of this
world will be cast out.” (John 12:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has
been judged.” (John 16:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“in whose case the god of this world has blinded the minds of
the unbelieving so that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory
of Christ, who is the image of God.” (2 Corinthians 4:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan exploits believers through their own arrogance.
This is how controls the human race.  Satan was the first of God's creatures to
use his free will to sin against God in arrogance. Arrogance was Satan’s
original sin. In Ephesians 2:2, “sons of disobedience” refer to believers who
are out of fellowship and living in carnality in the world system of Satan.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“in which you formerly walked according to the course of this
world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is
now working in the sons of disobedience.” (Ephesians 2:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spirituality and carnality are absolutes in the Christian
life. The believer is either 100% filled and controlled by the Holy Spirit and
living in the spiritual life, or they are 100% living in the world system and
in a state of carnality where their old sin nature controls their soul.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The world system of Satan emphasizes self-centered arrogance
– the preoccupation with self. This is followed by antagonism and intolerance
toward God and the plan of God. This antagonism and intolerance extends to all
other believers, especially those growing spiritually. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan’s primary targets are believers and the Word of
God. If the believer stays in carnality long enough, they go from being
negative to Bible doctrine to being antagonistic toward Bible doctrine and
those positive to the consistent intake of Bible doctrine. While in carnality,
the believer emphasizes human viewpoint over divine viewpoint.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>While in carnality, the believer is arrogant, preoccupied
with themselves and has no time for God or Bible doctrine. If in carnality long
enough, the believer gains animosity and antagonism toward God, the Word of
God, and God's plan for their lives. See category on <a href="#_D-Reversionism">Reversionism</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The World System’s Influence on the Unbeliever</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan also exploits mankind with deceitful propaganda and
indoctrination that promotes antagonism toward anything related to God,
especially the grace of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Demon Influence of
Unbelievers</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The unbeliever’s life is defined as one without God. All
unbelievers are influenced, to some degree, by the world system that surrounds
them. The unbeliever excludes God from their thinking. The unbeliever’s
thinking, motivation, decisions, and actions are directly involved in Satan’s
world system. Demon influence is the doctrine of demons accumulating in the
soul of the unbeliever through human viewpoint thinking.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>However, the unbeliever has a means of protection
available to them against Satan’s system. This means of protection starts with
their volition and how they use it in relation to authority orientation, the
rule of law, and the laws of divine establishment. These protections are
provided by God for the entire human race and are instituted to protect the
human race from self-destruction. The laws of divine establishment are the only
system of truth that an unbeliever can understand. See category on the <a
href="#_D-Laws_of_Divine">Laws of Divine Establishment</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The easiest way for the unbeliever to live in the world
system is to be negative to divinely delegated systems of governance and
authority that are found in the laws of divine establishment.  Self-centered
arrogance results in authority disorientation and living in Satan’s world
system. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Demon Possession of
Unbelievers</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Demon possession is defined as demon invasion into the
body of an unbeliever by one or more demons. Fallen angels or demons can
possess the body of unbelievers only. Demons possess so much energy that when
they indwell a human being, all sorts of neurotic and psychotic behavior are
manifest. This doesn’t mean the demons themselves are erratic, but their
influence on the body is erratic.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Because the body of every Church Age believer is indwelt
by all three members of the Trinity, no demon can indwell the body of a
believer. Demon possession is generally related to religion, the phallic cult,
and the emotional revolt of the soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The World System Influence on the Believer</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer in fellowship with God is filled with the
Holy Spirit and walking in the Spirit. Eph. 5:18; Gal. 5:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but
be filled with the Spirit,” (Ephesians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the
desire of the flesh.” (Galatians 5:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When the believer sins and is out of fellowship
(carnality), they grieve and quench the Holy Spirit until they confess their
sins to God the Father and regain the filling of the Holy Spirit. The carnal
believer becomes unstable if they stay in carnality long enough. Eph. 4:30; 1
Thess. 5:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed
for the day of redemption.” (Ephesians 4:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do not quench the Spirit;” (1 Thessalonians 5:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The carnal believer’s thinking is called human viewpoint
thinking because there is no function of the filling of the Holy Spirit and
therefore no possible application of Bible doctrine. Everything the carnal
believer thinks or does is unacceptable to God and is called “wood, hay, and
straw” and will be removed by fire at the Judgment Seat of Christ. 1 Cor.
3:11-16. See category on <a href="#_D-Divine_Viewpoint_vs.">Divine Viewpoint
vs. Human Viewpoint</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For no man can lay a foundation other than the one which is
laid, which is Jesus Christ. Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold,
silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, each man's work will become evident;
for the day will show it because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire
itself will test the quality of each man's work. If any man's work which he has
built on it remains, he will receive a reward. If any man's work is burned up,
he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire. Do
you not know that you are a temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in
you?” (1 Corinthians 3:11-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer is commanded to avoid influence of and involvement
in the world system. 1 Tim. 4:1-2; Eph. 4:27. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will
fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and doctrines
of demons, by means of the hypocrisy of liars seared in their own conscience as
with a branding iron,” (1 Timothy 4:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and do not give the devil an opportunity.” (Ephesians 4:27,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer who gets into the world system through sin
remains there to produce human good and evil. They give the devil opportunity
the longer they remain in carnality. The believer’s only way back to
spirituality and the filling of the Holy Spirit in through confession of sins
to God the Father using 1 John 1:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer living in carnality for an extended period
of time becomes heavily influenced by the world system surrounding them. Rom.
8:7; 1 Cor. 3:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“because the mind set on the flesh is hostile toward God; for
it does not subject itself to the law of God, for it is not even able to do
so,” (Romans 8:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“for you are still fleshly. For since there is jealousy and
strife among you, are you not fleshly, and are you not walking like mere men?”
(1 Corinthians 3:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Such believers become enemies of the Cross, enemies of
God, even haters of God. Phil. 3:18; James 4:4; John 15:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For many walk, of whom I often told you, and now tell you even
weeping, that they are enemies of the cross of Christ,” (Philippians 3:18,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“You adulteresses, do you not know that friendship with the
world is hostility toward God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the
world makes himself an enemy of God.” (James 4:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;He who hates Me hates My Father also.” (John 15:23,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Carnal believers become double minded and opposers of
Jesus Christ or antichrists. James 4:8; 1 John 2:18; 1 John 2:22; 1 John 4:3; 2
John 1:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your
hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded.” (James 4:8,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Children, it is the last hour; and just as you heard that
antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have appeared; from this we
know that it is the last hour.” (1 John 2:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Who is the liar but the one who denies that Jesus is the
Christ? This is the antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the Son.” (1
John 2:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God;
this is the spirit of the antichrist, of which you have heard that it is
coming, and now it is already in the world.” (1 John 4:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do
not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. This is the deceiver and
the antichrist.” (2 John 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Demon Influence of Believers</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All Church Age believers’ bodies are indwelt by all three
members of the Godhead. Therefore, a believer cannot be demon possessed.
However, the believer’s soul can be influenced by demons and demonic doctrine. When
the believer remains in carnality for a prolonged period, they absorb the
thinking of the world system around them. This is from the vacuum in their soul
that pulls in this demonic thinking. Demon invasion of thought affects
self-consciousness, volition, and mental attitude. 1 Tim. 4:1. See category on <a
href="#_D-Soul_Vacuum">Soul Vacuum</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will
fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and doctrines
of demons,” (1 Timothy 4:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ephesians 4:17, “futility” is <span lang=EL>ματαιο</span>́<span
lang=EL>της</span><span lang=EL> </span>(mataiotēs) in the Greek and means
devoid of truth, depravity, futility. With the soul empty of any truth and not
functioning spiritual life in carnality, a vacuum pulls in anything to fill the
void – Satanic thinking, the doctrines of demons. Their soul also becomes
darkened and calloused toward Bible doctrine and is called scar tissue. Eph.
4:18-19. See category on <a href="#_D-Scar_Tissue_of">Scar Tissue of the Soul</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So this I say, and affirm together with the Lord, that you
walk no longer just as the Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their mind,”
(Ephesians 4:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“being darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life
of God because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of
their heart; and they, having become callous, have given themselves over to
sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness.”
(Ephesians 4:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The world system continues to influence the believer when
they live and function in carnality which they enter through personal sin. The
longer the believer’s residence in this condition, the more influence the word
system exerts on their thinking and resultant behavior.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Demon influence results from the believer’s soul being
filled with the thinking of Satan’s world system. The believer becomes
vulnerable to the influence of demonic or false doctrine in their souls as this
false doctrine accumulates through continual carnality and involvement in the
world system. In this condition, the believer’s thinking and emotions become
controlled by their living life in Satan’s world system. 1 Peter 5:8-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Be of sober spirit, be on the alert. Your adversary, the
devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour. But resist
him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same experiences of suffering are
being accomplished by your brethren who are in the world.” (1 Peter 5:8-9,
NASB)            </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer has limited protection while out of
fellowship through adherence to the laws of divine establishment. The
believer’s protection is unlimited when they are filled with the Holy Spirit.
As they grow spiritually, the influence of the world system is systematically
diminished as their thinking is renewed. Rom. 12:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by
the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that
which is good and acceptable and perfect.” (Romans 12:2, NASB)</p>
