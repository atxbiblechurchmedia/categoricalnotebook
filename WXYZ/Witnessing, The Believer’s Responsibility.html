<h2>Witnessing, The Believer’s Responsibility</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every Church Age believer is responsible for making
Christ known because as a priest, they have a right to represent God before man
since Jesus Christ is absent from the earth. In witnessing, you are to make the
issue clear of the person and saving work of Christ on the Cross. Every
believer must know the following Bible doctrines to witness effectively. 2 Cor.
5:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that
we might become the righteousness of God in Him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Corinthians
5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Redemption</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The human race is born into the slave market of sin. Only
a man free from imputed and inherent sin and personal acts of sin can buy man’s
freedom. Only Jesus Christ qualified because of His virgin birth. When He died
spiritually on the Cross, He purchased man’s redemption from the slave market
of sin. Rom. 5:1-21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with
God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom also we have obtained our
introduction by faith into this grace in which we stand; and we exult in hope
of the glory of God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 5:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we
were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, having now been justified
by His blood, we shall be saved from the wrath of God through Him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
5:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through
the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by
His life. And not only this, but we also exult in God through our Lord Jesus
Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
5:10-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For if by the transgression of the one, death reigned through
the one, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of
righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ. So then as
through one transgression there resulted condemnation to all men, even so
through one act of righteousness there resulted justification of life to all
men.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 5:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“so that, as sin reigned in death, even so grace would reign
through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Regeneration</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Nicodemus was a Pharisee and a ruler of the Jews. He was
highly religious and was a “do-gooder” and “hustler” in the Judaistic program.
John 3:1-2. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler
of the Jews; this man came to Jesus by night and said to Him, “Rabbi, we know
that You have come from God as a teacher; for no one can do these signs that
You do unless God is with him.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 3:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus showed him immediately that he needed to be
born-again. Nicodemus needed to be born spiritually into God’s family. You must
have a relationship with the Lord before you can have fellowship with Him. John
3:3. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Jesus answered and said to him, “Truly, truly, I say to you,
unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(John
3:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A person is either a child of God or a child of the devil.
Gal. 3:26; John 8:44.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Galatians
3:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the
desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not
stand in the truth because there is no truth in him. Whenever he speaks a lie,
he speaks from his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John
8:44, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Physical birth is not enough. The mechanics of
regeneration are given in John 3:5. “Water” is the Word of God and with the
Holy Spirit, man is regenerated. Faith in Jesus Christ is the answer to the
problem of regeneration. Eph. 5:26; John 16:8-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is
born of water and the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John
3:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“so that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the
washing of water with the word,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 5:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““And He, when He comes, will convict the world concerning sin
and righteousness and judgment; concerning sin, because they do not believe in
Me; and concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father and you no longer
see Me; and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been
judged.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 16:8-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Positional Truth</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every person living has a position “in Christ” or “in
Adam.” The result of being in Christ is life. The result of being in Adam is
death. The characteristics of our position in Christ are as follows. It is not
experiential nor an emotion. It is not related to human merit. It is not
progressive and cannot be improved. It is eternal in nature. It is known only
by revelation in the Word of God. It is obtained in toto at the moment of
salvation. Eph. 1:6; 2 Cor. 5:17; Rom. 8:32ff.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely
bestowed on us in the Beloved.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 1:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creature; the
old things passed away; behold, new things have come.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2
Corinthians 5:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him over for
us all, how will He not also with Him freely give us all things?”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
8:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Who will bring a charge against God’s elect? God is the one
who justifies; who is the one who condemns? Christ Jesus is He who died, yes,
rather who was raised, who is at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for
us. Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will tribulation, or distress,
or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
8:33-35, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels,
nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor
height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us
from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
8:38-39, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Unlimited Atonement</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When Christ died spiritually on the Cross, He died for
the sins of the whole world so that everyone might be saved. However, the
individual unbeliever must exercise positive volition toward the work of
Christ. Our responsibility is to appropriate what He did by faith. Rom. 5:6; 1
Tim. 2:6; 1 Tim. 4:10; Titus 2:11; Heb. 2:9; 2 Peter 2:1; 1 John 2:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For while we were still helpless, at the right time Christ
died for the ungodly.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 5:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“who gave Himself as a ransom for all, the testimony given at
the proper time.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Timothy 2:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For it is for this we labor and strive, because we have fixed
our hope on the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of
believers.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Timothy 4:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all
men,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Titus 2:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But we do see Him who was made for a little while lower than
the angels, namely, Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory
and honor, so that by the grace of God He might taste death for everyone.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews
2:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But false prophets also arose among the people, just as there
will also be false teachers among you, who will secretly introduce destructive
heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing swift destruction
upon themselves.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Peter 2:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins; and not for
ours only, but also for those of the whole world.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 John 2:2,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Imputation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>2 Corinthians 3 and 4 show that every believer is a
minister and has the responsibility of witnessing. 2 Corinthians 5:21 is a
summary of salvation. God the Father made the sinless humanity of Jesus Christ to
be sin on our behalf, that we might be made the righteousness of God in Christ.
On the Cross, Jesus Christ died spiritually for us before He died physically.
In salvation our sins are blotted out, we have eternal life, and credited
(imputed) to our account is God's perfect righteousness.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that
we might become the righteousness of God in Him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Corinthians
5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Grace</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Grace is God’s complete provision for all our needs.
Grace is what He is free to do for us in the person of Jesus Christ. Grace is
undeserved and unmerited. Salvation is provided by grace. Believers are the
praise of the glory of His grace and are accepted in the Beloved. Eph. 1:6-7. </p>

<p class=Verses>“to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely
bestowed on us in the Beloved. In Him we have redemption through His blood, the
forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians
1:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Grace is given by means of Jesus Christ. 1 Cor. 1:4-5. </p>

<p class=Verses>“I thank my God always concerning you for the grace of God
which was given you in Christ Jesus, that in everything you were enriched in
Him, in all speech and all knowledge,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 1:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is full of grace and truth. John 1:14.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw His
glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John
1:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Grace provides salvation. The more you work for
salvation, the deeper in debt you go. Titus 2:11; Eph. 2:8-9; Rom. 4:4-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all
men,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Titus 2:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not
of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one
may boast.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 2:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now to the one who works, his wage is not credited as a favor,
but as what is due. But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who
justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
4:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Grace is the Christian way of life. We regain fellowship
with God (spirituality) through confession of our known sins to God the Father
and by grace we are restored to the filling of the Holy Spirit. Our
relationship with the Holy Spirit is by faith.  1 John 1:9. </p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
John 1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All prayer is to God the Father while filled with the
Holy Spirit and is all grace. Heb. 4:16. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore let us draw near with confidence to the throne of
grace, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews
4:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Good works or divine good production is a function of
grace. 1 Cor. 15:10. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward
me did not prove vain; but I labored even more than all of them, yet not I, but
the grace of God with me.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 15:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Suffering for blessing is a means of accelerated
spiritual growth whereby we rely on God's grace resources instead of our own. 2
Cor. 12:1-9. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Boasting is necessary, though it is not profitable; but I will
go on to visions and revelations of the Lord. I know a man in Christ who
fourteen years ago—whether in the body I do not know, or out of the body I do
not know, God knows—such a man was caught up to the third heaven. And I know
how such a man—whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know, God
knows— was caught up into Paradise and heard inexpressible words, which a man
is not permitted to speak. On behalf of such a man I will boast; but on my own
behalf I will not boast, except in regard to my weaknesses. For if I do wish to
boast I will not be foolish, for I will be speaking the truth; but I refrain
from this, so that no one will credit me with more than he sees in me or hears
from me. Because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, for this
reason, to keep me from exalting myself, there was given me a thorn in the
flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me—to keep me from exalting myself!
Concerning this I implored the Lord three times that it might leave me. And He
has said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for power is perfected in
weakness.” Most gladly, therefore, I will rather boast about my weaknesses, so
that the power of Christ may dwell in me.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Corinthians 12:1-9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The enabling power of God the Holy Spirit is available to
every believer while filled with the Holy Spirit. 2 Tim. 2:1. </p>

<p class=Verses>“You therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in
Christ Jesus.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Timothy 2:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our spiritual growth is all by the grace of God. 2 Peter
3:18. </p>

<p class=Verses>“but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory, both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2
Peter 3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual stability results from our spiritual growth. 1
Peter 5:12; Heb. 13:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Through Silvanus, our faithful brother (for so I regard him),
I have written to you briefly, exhorting and testifying that this is the true
grace of God. Stand firm in it!”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Peter 5:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do not be carried away by varied and strange teachings; for it
is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace, not by foods, through which
those who were so occupied were not benefited.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 13:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Necessity of Staying in Fellowship</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The objective of the Christian way of life is to stay in
fellowship, transfer the Word to the soul and erect an edification complex. 1
John 1:9; Col. 2:6; Eph. 3; Eph. 4. </p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
John 1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk
in Him,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Colossians 2:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is the basis of power or the filling of the Spirit
for understanding and absorbing Bible doctrine and for monopolies of the
Christian way of life such as the fruit of the Spirit. Gal. 5:22-23. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience,
kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things
there is no law.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Galatians 5:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Confession of sin does not always remove divine
discipline, but the best place to endure divine discipline is in fellowship.
Heb. 12:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“FOR THOSE WHOM THE LORD LOVES HE DISCIPLINES, AND HE SCOURGES
EVERY SON WHOM HE RECEIVES.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 12:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The True Nature of Religion</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus indicted religion in Matthew 23. It blinds people
to the truth about the person and work of Jesus Christ. A religious person is a
“tough nut to crack” in witnessing. Satan is the father of religion and has his
own communion table. John 8:44; 2 Cor. 11:3-4; 2 Cor. 11:13-15; 1 Cor.
10:20-21.</p>

<p class=Verses>““You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the
desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not
stand in the truth because there is no truth in him. Whenever he speaks a lie,
he speaks from his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John
8:44, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But I am afraid that, as the serpent deceived Eve by his
craftiness, your minds will be led astray from the simplicity and purity of
devotion to Christ. For if one comes and preaches another Jesus whom we have
not preached, or you receive a different spirit which you have not received, or
a different gospel which you have not accepted, you bear this beautifully.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2
Corinthians 11:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising
themselves as apostles of Christ. No wonder, for even Satan disguises himself
as an angel of light. Therefore it is not surprising if his servants also
disguise themselves as servants of righteousness, whose end will be according
to their deeds.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Corinthians 11:13-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“No, but I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice,
they sacrifice to demons and not to God; and I do not want you to become
sharers in demons. You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons;
you cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Corinthians 10:20-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Doubtful Issues</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is a tremendous realm of activities in life that
cannot be classified as good or bad according to God’s Word. However, there are
three laws which will answer questions regarding how to handle doubtful or
uncertain issues and situations in life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Corinth was a good-time city, a “Vanity Fair” of the
Roman Empire. There were many heathen temples there containing bars, banks,
prostitution centers, and the best cafeterias in town. However, meat served in
the cafeteria and adjacent market had been offered to idols in the heathen temple.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i><u>The Law of Liberty Toward Self.</u></i>  The
believer has the right to walk in fellowship and to serve the Lord. However,
this is not the liberty to sin or to cause another weaker or more immature
believer to sin. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Corinth, the debatable issue was meat that had been
involved in idol worship. The Corinthian believers understood that eating meat
was not a sin for they had been liberated from heathenism. However, there were
some believers present who did not have the knowledge that an idol was nothing
and would be upset that other Corinthian believers were eating meat that had
been associated with idol worship. These more mature believers should have refrained
from eating such meat in the presence of weaker and less mature believers. Knowledge
can led to egocentricity, but love builds up. l Cor. 8:1-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now concerning things sacrificed to idols, we know that we all
have knowledge. Knowledge makes arrogant, but love edifies. If anyone supposes
that he knows anything, he has not yet known as he ought to know; but if anyone
loves God, he is known by Him. Therefore concerning the eating of things
sacrificed to idols, we know that there is no such thing as an idol in the
world, and that there is no God but one. For even if there are so-called gods
whether in heaven or on earth, as indeed there are many gods and many lords,
yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom are all things and we
exist for Him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we exist
through Him. However not all men have this knowledge; but some, being
accustomed to the idol until now, eat food as if it were sacrificed to an idol;
and their conscience being weak is defiled. But food will not commend us to
God; we are neither the worse if we do not eat, nor the better if we do eat.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Corinthians 8:1-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i><u>The Law of Love Toward Believers</u></i>. The Law
of Love is defined as a believer voluntarily refraining from doing certain
things that would cause a weaker believer to sin and thus stumble in the
spiritual life. The more mature believer does this because of their love for their
Savior and their unconditional love for their fellow less mature believers. We
are to beware that our liberty doesn’t become a stumbling block to a weaker
believer. Weak believers often saw the other believers in a restaurant or meat
market and at dinner parties where meat was served. 1 Cor. 8:7-13; 1 Cor.
10:23-26; 1 Cor. 10:27-31.</p>

<p class=Verses>“However not all men have this knowledge; but some, being
accustomed to the idol until now, eat food as if it were sacrificed to an idol;
and their conscience being weak is defiled. But food will not commend us to
God; we are neither the worse if we do not eat, nor the better if we do eat.
But take care that this liberty of yours does not somehow become a stumbling
block to the weak. For if someone sees you, who have knowledge, dining in an
idol’s temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be strengthened to eat
things sacrificed to idols? For through your knowledge he who is weak is
ruined, the brother for whose sake Christ died. And so, by sinning against the
brethren and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ.
Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will never eat meat again,
so that I will not cause my brother to stumble.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians
8:7-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“All things are lawful, but not all things are profitable. All
things are lawful, but not all things edify. Let no one seek his own good, but
that of his neighbor. Eat anything that is sold in the meat market without
asking questions for conscience’ sake; FOR THE EARTH IS THE LORD’S, AND ALL IT
CONTAINS.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 10:23-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“If one of the unbelievers invites you and you want to go, eat
anything that is set before you without asking questions for conscience’ sake.
But if anyone says to you, “This is meat sacrificed to idols,” do not eat it,
for the sake of the one who informed you, and for conscience’ sake; I mean not
your own conscience, but the other man’s; for why is my freedom judged by
another’s conscience? If I partake with thankfulness, why am I slandered
concerning that for which I give thanks? Whether, then, you eat or drink or
whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians
10:27-31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Through the application of every believer’s law of
liberty, the weaker believer may get out of temporal fellowship. Actually you
sin against Christ when you cause a fellow believer to get out of fellowship.
The law of love is a higher law than the law of liberty. The law of liberty is
not the liberty to keep on sinning, but the liberty to serve the Lord without
sin’s domination. 1 Cor. 8:11-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For through your knowledge he who is weak is ruined, the
brother for whose sake Christ died. And so, by sinning against the brethren and
wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Corinthians 8:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i><u>The Law of Expediency Toward Unbelievers</u>.</i>
Because of the believer’s witness for Jesus Christ to unbelievers, there are
some things they should not do thus having a positive testimony for Jesus
Christ. No one is to seek their own area of pleasure (l Cor. 10:24), but
everyone is to seek another’s good. If a Corinthian believer (l Cor. 10:25-27)
were invited to an unbeliever’s home, he was not to make an issue out of the
meat, but to make Jesus Christ the issue. However, if the unbeliever made an
issue out of the meat, he was to refuse it, taking a stand. The general rule is
to do everything to glorify the Lord Jesus. 1 Cor. 10:23-33.</p>

<p class=Verses>“All things are lawful, but not all things are profitable. All
things are lawful, but not all things edify. Let no one seek his own good, but
that of his neighbor. Eat anything that is sold in the meat market without
asking questions for conscience’ sake; FOR THE EARTH IS THE LORD’S, AND ALL IT
CONTAINS. If one of the unbelievers invites you and you want to go, eat
anything that is set before you without asking questions for conscience’ sake.
But if anyone says to you, “This is meat sacrificed to idols,” do not eat it,
for the sake of the one who informed you, and for conscience’ sake; I mean not
your own conscience, but the other man’s; for why is my freedom judged by
another’s conscience? If I partake with thankfulness, why am I slandered
concerning that for which I give thanks? Whether, then, you eat or drink or
whatever you do, do all to the glory of God. Give no offense either to Jews or
to Greeks or to the church of God; just as I also please all men in all things,
not seeking my own profit but the profit of the many, so that they may be
saved.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 10:23-33, NASB)</p>
