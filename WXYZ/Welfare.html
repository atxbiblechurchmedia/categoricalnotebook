<h2><a name="_Welfare"></a>Welfare</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Since the fall of man, God has ordained that mankind work
hard. Gen. 3:19. </p>

<p class=Verses>“By the sweat of your face You will eat bread, Till you return
to the ground, Because from it you were taken; For you are dust, And to dust
you shall return.&quot;” (Genesis 3:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This hard work is equated with eating in Genesis 3:17. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then to Adam He said, &quot;Because you have listened to the
voice of your wife, and have eaten from the tree about which I commanded you,
saying, 'You shall not eat from it'; Cursed is the ground because of you; In
toil you will eat of it All the days of your life.” (Genesis 3:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The capacity for man to hold down a job and get profit
for his labors is based on the grace of God. Prov. 10:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD will not allow the righteous to hunger, But He will
reject the craving of the wicked.” (Proverbs 10:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If a believer does not provide for his household, he is
worse than an unbeliever. 1 Tim. 5:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for
those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an
unbeliever.” (1 Timothy 5:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Welfare is a bona fide principle among the helpless and
hopeless. This includes widows, those who have lost their fathers, or orphans
where the parents have deserted them, and the physically handicapped. Acts 6:1;
James 1:27; Luke 5:17-26.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now at this time while the disciples were increasing in
number, a complaint arose on the part of the Hellenistic Jews against the
native Hebrews, because their widows were being overlooked in the daily serving
of food.” (Acts 6:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Pure and undefiled religion in the sight of our God and Father
is this: to visit orphans and widows in their distress, and to keep oneself
unstained by the world.” (James 1:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“One day He was teaching; and there were some Pharisees and
teachers of the law sitting there, who had come from every village of Galilee
and Judea and from Jerusalem; and the power of the Lord was present for Him to
perform healing. And some men were carrying on a bed a man who was paralyzed;
and they were trying to bring him in and to set him down in front of Him.”
(Luke 5:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Welfare is also bona fide to the aged and those in an
emergency – the Good Samaritan principle. 1 Tim. 5:9; 1 Tim. 5:16; Luke
10:30-42; Luke 11:5-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“A widow is to be put on the list only if she is not less than
sixty years old, having been the wife of one man,” (1 Timothy 5:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“If any woman who is a believer has dependent widows, she must
assist them and the church must not be burdened, so that it may assist those
who are widows indeed.” (1 Timothy 5:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Jesus replied and said, &quot;A man was going down from
Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among robbers, and they stripped him and beat
him, and went away leaving him half dead.” (Luke 10:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But a Samaritan, who was on a journey, came upon him;
and when he saw him, he felt compassion, and came to him and bandaged up his
wounds, pouring oil and wine on them; and he put him on his own beast, and
brought him to an inn and took care of him.” (Luke 10:33-34, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then He said to them, &quot;Suppose one of you has a friend,
and goes to him at midnight and says to him, 'Friend, lend me three loaves; for
a friend of mine has come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set
before him'; and from inside he answers and says, 'Do not bother me; the door
has already been shut and my children and I are in bed; I cannot get up and
give you anything.' &quot;I tell you, even though he will not get up and give
him anything because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence he will
get up and give him as much as he needs. &quot;So I say to you, ask, and it
will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to
you. &quot;For everyone who asks, receives; and he who seeks, finds; and to him
who knocks, it will be opened.” (Luke 11:5-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The abuse of welfare can destroy a nation. Welfare is
abused when it promotes a mental attitude of laziness. Deciding to not work
when you are able results in idleness which breeds the busybody and often a bad
mental attitude, “The world owes me a living.” 2 Thess. 3:6; 2 Thess. 3:10-12; Prov.
24:30-34; Prov. 30:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ, that you keep away from every brother who leads an unruly life and not
according to the tradition which you received from us.” (2 Thessalonians 3:6,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For even when we were with you, we used to give you this
order: if anyone is not willing to work, then he is not to eat, either. For we
hear that some among you are leading an undisciplined life, doing no work at
all, but acting like busybodies. Now such persons we command and exhort in the
Lord Jesus Christ to work in quiet fashion and eat their own bread.” (2
Thessalonians 3:10-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“I passed by the field of the sluggard And by the vineyard of
the man lacking sense, And behold, it was completely overgrown with thistles;
Its surface was covered with nettles, And its stone wall was broken down. When
I saw, I reflected upon it; I looked, and received instruction. &quot;A little
sleep, a little slumber, A little folding of the hands to rest,&quot; Then your
poverty will come as a robber And your want like an armed man.” (Proverbs
24:30-34, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The leech has two daughters, &quot;Give,&quot;
&quot;Give.&quot; There are three things that will not be satisfied, Four that
will not say, &quot;Enough&quot;:” (Proverbs 30:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Welfare is abused when it promotes a lack of initiative. Welfare
can cause excessive taxation. Prov. 12:24; Rom. 13:6-7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The hand of the diligent will rule, But the slack hand will be
put to forced labor.” (Proverbs 12:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For because of this you also pay taxes, for rulers are
servants of God, devoting themselves to this very thing. Render to all what is
due them: tax to whom tax is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear;
honor to whom honor.” (Romans 13:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Illegitimate welfare is the child of Socialism where the
state cares for every need of the citizen. It is always is a suicidal path. Also
like Issachar, he became the servant to tribute. Lam. 1:1. </p>

<p class=Verses>“How lonely sits the city That was full of people! She has
become like a widow Who was once great among the nations! She who was a
princess among the provinces Has become a forced laborer!” (Lamentations 1:1,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What is the biblical solution to excessive welfare and
taxation or lack of motivation in a nation? God’s judgment of the nation in the
form of economic collapse and ultimately slavery which refers to occupation by
a foreign power. War which results in slavery. If enough believers will study Bible
doctrine and grow to spiritual maturity, they will preserve a nation because of
the salt/light principle. However, up to the fourth cycle of discipline, the
tide can be turned, but when a nation gets into the fifth cycle of discipline, it’s
too late. As the Sin Unto Death is to a believer, the Fifth Cycle of Discipline
is to a nation. Lev. 26:25-27.</p>

<p class=Verses>“'I will also bring upon you a sword which will execute
vengeance for the covenant; and when you gather together into your cities, I
will send pestilence among you, so that you shall be delivered into enemy
hands. 'When I break your staff of bread, ten women will bake your bread in one
oven, and they will bring back your bread in rationed amounts, so that you will
eat and not be satisfied. 'Yet if in spite of this you do not obey Me, but act
with hostility against Me,” (Leviticus 26:25-27, NASB)</p>
