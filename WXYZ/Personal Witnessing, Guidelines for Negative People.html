<h2>Personal Witnessing, Guidelines When Conversing with Negative People</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Only a maximum amount of doctrine can keep the tongue in
line. James 3:2; James 3:8; James 3:17. In James 3:2 the word “to bridle” is
the aorist active infinitive of <span lang=EL>χαλιναγωγε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(chalinagōgeō) and means to guide with a bridle, to hold in check.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For we all stumble in many ways. If anyone does not stumble in
what he says, he is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body as well.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(James
3:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But no one can tame the tongue; it is a restless evil and full
of deadly poison.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(James 3:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable,
gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, unwavering, without
hypocrisy.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(James 3:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The “mature” in Hebrews 5:14 is <span lang=EL>τε</span>́<span
lang=EL>λειος</span><span lang=EL> </span>(teleios) in the Greek and means
completed, mature or full grown. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But solid food is for the mature, who because of practice have
their senses trained to discern good and evil.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 5:14, NASB)
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Badmouthing is symptomatic of every kind of human
viewpoint. James 3:16. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is
disorder and every evil thing.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(James 3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A person with negative volition can be unapproachable to
the point where you can’t talk with them. They may be too dogmatic to the point
that you can’t reason with them. They will never admit to being wrong, so you
won’t be able to correct them. They may have an authoritarian manner of
declaration that approaches blind dogmatism.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A negative person can be arrogant with an
all-encompassing omniscience on all subjects they undertake to discuss. They
may be an unapproachable, intolerant spirit, unwilling to be taught and
unreachable with discussion on opposing views. A negative person may be so
conceited that you can’t reach them. They may be a little dictator whereby you
can’t tell them anything because they already know everything.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A negative person may resort to criticizing or
badmouthing. Such criticizing targets either the person of the one giving the Gospel
message or doctrinal teaching or against the actual message of the Gospel or
doctrine.  Either way, the criticizing or badmouthing is ultimately against the
essence of God. 2 Cor. 10:1-2; 2 Cor. 10:4-6; 2 Cor. 10:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now I, Paul, myself urge you by the meekness and gentleness of
Christ—I who am meek when face to face with you, but bold toward you when
absent! I ask that when I am present I need not be bold with the confidence
with which I propose to be courageous against some, who regard us as if we
walked according to the flesh.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Corinthians 10:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but
divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses. We are destroying
speculations and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God, and
we are taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ, and we are
ready to punish all disobedience, whenever your obedience is complete.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2
Corinthians 10:4-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“for I do not wish to seem as if I would terrify you by my
letters.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Corinthians 10:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Either the preaching is too strong and personal or there
is too little preaching and too much teaching. Some feel that categorical Bible
doctrine teaching is the only right way and that all other ministers, no matter
how fundamental, have been all wrong.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some negative people feel the original languages are just
too confusing and “I can’t check out what I’m being taught.” Some feel the
language from the pulpit is crude and it offends them. Some feel that the
necessity of daily teaching bothers them since no previous generations have
emphasized it.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Negative people may say that the local church is
emphasized to the exclusion of Bible colleges, seminaries, camp programs, child
evangelism, missions, etc. Some pastor’s messages sound intolerant of other
views, churches, denominations, or individuals. He does not have a loving
message. His message neglects the social needs of his congregation. He does not
give an invitation. How can people get saved in such a place?  He is a very
subtle false teacher and is the devil incarnate.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What is the solution to people who criticize or badmouth?
Stay in fellowship and continue the consistent intake and application of Bible
doctrine. Consider the source. Gal. 6:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Brethren, even if anyone is caught in any trespass, you who
are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; each one looking
to yourself, so that you too will not be tempted.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Galatians 6:1,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They may need more information presented in a different
way or set of conditions. Possibly they need to be questioned such as “Are you
in fellowship?” Possibly they need to be set straight such as “Look, I don’t
have to listen to you stating garbage like that?” 2 Cor. 10:5-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“We are destroying speculations and every lofty thing raised up
against the knowledge of God, and we are taking every thought captive to the
obedience of Christ, and we are ready to punish all disobedience, whenever your
obedience is complete.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Corinthians 10:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It may be necessary to avoid them. 2 Cor. 6:11-12; Rom.
16:17-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Our mouth has spoken freely to you, O Corinthians, our heart
is opened wide. You are not restrained by us, but you are restrained in your
own affections.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Corinthians 6:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now I urge you, brethren, keep your eye on those who cause
dissensions and hindrances contrary to the teaching which you learned, and turn
away from them. For such men are slaves, not of our Lord Christ but of their
own appetites; and by their smooth and flattering speech they deceive the
hearts of the unsuspecting.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 16:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ask them if they have talked face to face with their
pastor-teacher about their positions on certain doctrines. You may have to tell
them that they are simply out of line on the doctrines being discussed. Suggest
that they attend Bible class more regularly and let God the Holy Spirit correct
them from within their souls. Titus 2:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“These things speak and exhort and reprove with all authority.
Let no one disregard you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Titus 2:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Do they regularly attend Bible class? Are they quoting
what someone else says? Are they the spokesman for a group of people, but won’t
give any names. “There are a number of people who are dissatisfied.” Remember,
if people have rejected grace and confession of sin per 1 John 1:9 or you are
dealing with carnal believers, those in emotional revolt of the soul or
reversionistic believers.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
John 1:9, NASB)</p>
