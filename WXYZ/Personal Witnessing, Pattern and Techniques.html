<h2>Personal Witnessing, Pattern and Techniques</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Presentation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They made an effective contact. In 1 Thessalonians 2:1-2,
“brethren” refers to believers in the Lord Jesus Christ. Paul was in
Thessalonica only three weeks. Their witness was not in vain. They presented
the Gospel in spite of opposition. They had just come from Philippi where they
were shamefully mistreated and put in prison, but they kept on proclaiming
Christ. Satan tried to cut them off at Philippi. The greatest opposition to
personal witnessing is the old sin nature. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For you yourselves know, brethren, that our coming to you was
not in vain, but after we had already suffered and been mistreated in Philippi,
as you know, we had the boldness in our God to speak to you the gospel of God
amid much opposition.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Thessalonians 2:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Gospel must never be “watered down.” It had not been
given in deceitfulness of uncleanness or guile. The Gospel had not been
“watered down” or diluted. The believer is tested by the Lord for the purpose
of approval. They had received the Gospel as a deposit. Since God has deposited
in us the Gospel, we must not please men, but God. God is the depositor and He examines
our hearts or the right lobe of our souls. Flattery is no good. Do not witness
for materialistic purposes. It is better to offend people than to offend God. 1
Thess. 2:3-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For our exhortation does not come from error or impurity or by
way of deceit; but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with
the gospel, so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God who examines our hearts.
For we never came with flattering speech, as you know, nor with a pretext for
greed—God is witness— nor did we seek glory from men, either from you or from
others, even though as apostles of Christ we might have asserted our authority.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Thessalonians 2:3-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We must love others unconditionally in presenting the
Gospel. Paul was as a nurse with the Thessalonian believers and worked hard. He
didn’t want to be a financial burden to them. An interest in people is produced
by the Holy Spirit. 1 Thess. 2:7-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But we proved to be gentle among you, as a nursing mother
tenderly cares for her own children. Having so fond an affection for you, we
were well-pleased to impart to you not only the gospel of God but also our own
lives, because you had become very dear to us. For you recall, brethren, our
labor and hardship, how working night and day so as not to be a burden to any
of you, we proclaimed to you the gospel of God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Thessalonians
2:7-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Gospel must be followed up by your behavior and
verbally. In our lives, Christ makes the difference. Paul, as a spiritual
leader and father, exhorted them and comforted them. The purpose of follow-up
is to walk worthy of God. 1 Thess. 2:10-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“You are witnesses, and so is God, how devoutly and uprightly
and blamelessly we behaved toward you believers; just as you know how we were
exhorting and encouraging and imploring each one of you as a father would his
own children, so that you would walk in a manner worthy of the God who calls
you into His own kingdom and glory.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Thessalonians 2:10-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Response</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They received the Word as authority. They applied the
Word. It is the Word that keeps working. They stood up under pressure and
persecution, opposition, and suffering. The churches in Judea had been
persecuted by the Jews who wanted to wipe out Christianity. These believers had
been treated similarly. 1 Thess. 2:13-16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason we also constantly thank God that when you
received the word of God which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the
word of men, but for what it really is, the word of God, which also performs
its work in you who believe. For you, brethren, became imitators of the
churches of God in Christ Jesus that are in Judea, for you also endured the
same sufferings at the hands of your own countrymen, even as they did from the
Jews, who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove us out. They
are not pleasing to God, but hostile to all men, hindering us from speaking to
the Gentiles so that they may be saved; with the result that they always fill
up the measure of their sins. But wrath has come upon them to the utmost.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Thessalonians 2:13-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Reward </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The reward includes fellowship, hope, and accomplishment.
You should want to see them again. Personal witnessing gives the believer a new
realization of their own hope. Winning a soul to Jesus Christ gives a sense of
accomplishment, a reward in time, and also a crown in eternity. 1 Thess.
2:17-20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But we, brethren, having been taken away from you for a short
while—in person, not in spirit—were all the more eager with great desire to see
your face. For we wanted to come to you—I, Paul, more than once—and yet Satan
hindered us. For who is our hope or joy or crown of exultation? Is it not even
you, in the presence of our Lord Jesus at His coming? For you are our glory and
joy.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Thessalonians 2:17-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Personal Witnessing Techniques</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>These techniques are merely suggestions. Use your own
techniques. No one method is the “sure fire way.” It is always the Word and the
ministry of the Holy Spirit that does the work.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Christianity definition technique. Ask people for
their definition of Christianity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The difference between good and bad technique. Show that
there is no absolute criterion between good and bad among friends and then show
that God is absolute righteousness.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What is the worst sin technique. Get people to give their
answer and then show rejection of Christ is the worst sin an unbeliever can
commit.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The investigation of Christ technique. Get people to
investigate who Jesus Christ is. Either He is God or a liar. He can’t be just a
“good” man. He has to be the Son of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The influence of Christianity technique. History gives
evidence of its influence among nations, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The memory card technique. Place Bible verses on cards
and have a person check you on them for memorization.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The quote a verse technique. Quote a Bible verse, as from
Proverbs, to provoke some thought in a conversation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The good Church technique. Show the Church is not of
primary importance at this point, it is the person of Jesus Christ that is the
issue.</p>
