<h2>The First Woman, Eve </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first woman was created by God as a helper for the
man in the image of Adam. Adam was created in the image of God. She was created
for the man because he was lonely. Gen. 1:27; Gen. 2:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“God created man in His own image, in the image of God He
created him; male and female He created them.” (Genesis 1:27, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD God said, &quot;It is not good for the man to be
alone; I will make him a helper suitable for him.&quot;” (Genesis 2:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew word for woman is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>אִשָּׁה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> (ishshah). Eve was brought to Adam to be a helper to him. A
woman does not have to hunt for the man. God’s plan already includes the man
for her. This helper was from God, not from lower creation. Lower creation is
not compatible with human beings, thus eliminating the concept of common
original evolution. Gen. 2:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The man gave names to all the cattle, and to the birds of the
sky, and to every beast of the field, but for Adam there was not found a helper
suitable for him.” (Genesis 2:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Eve was created by God as an adult woman. Eve was created
for Adam. Eve was formed from the rib of Adam. Adam lost something when the rib
was taken from him, but God gave it back to him in the form of a beautiful
woman. Gen. 2:21-22. </p>

<p class=Verses>“So the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and
he slept; then He took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh at that place.
The LORD God fashioned into a woman the rib which He had taken from the man,
and brought her to the man.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis 2:21-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Eve was made like Adam in body and soul. She was able to
have fellowship with Adam. Eve had a self-consciousness like Adam, so she was
aware of him. She had a mind like his and had thoughts of Adam just like he had
thoughts of her. Eve had volition (as do all of God’s creatures) with norms and
standards in her soul that were just like Adam’s. She had a human spirit just
as Adam did and was able to have fellowship with God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A woman then is a responder, not the initiator. Only in
this situation will she truly be happy. She is a helper of the same species. In
the marriage relationship, the woman fulfills the man and the man is complete
by having the woman. Gen. 2:23. </p>

<p class=Verses>“The man said, &quot;This is now bone of my bones, And flesh of
my flesh; She shall be called Woman, Because she was taken out of Man.&quot;”
(Genesis 2:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The woman was involved in the curse effects of the fall
of man. Gen. 3:1-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field
which the LORD God had made. And he said to the woman, &quot;Indeed, has God
said, 'You shall not eat from any tree of the garden'?&quot;” (Genesis 3:1,
NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that
it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one wise,
she took from its fruit and ate; and she gave also to her husband with her, and
he ate.” (Genesis 3:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“To the woman He said, &quot;I will greatly multiply Your pain
in childbirth, In pain you will bring forth children; Yet your desire will be
for your husband, And he will rule over you.&quot; Then to Adam He said,
&quot;Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten from
the tree about which I commanded you, saying, 'You shall not eat from it';
Cursed is the ground because of you; In toil you will eat of it All the days of
your life.” (Genesis 3:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Later, Eve was deceived by Satan. She was equally guilty
with Adam who deliberately sinned. Adam saw Eve spiritually dead before he
sinned. The only way Adam and Eve could sin (without an old sin nature) was by
the use of their negative volition. This caused spiritual death and brought
into existence the old sin nature. 1 Tim. 2:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And it was not Adam who was deceived, but the woman being
deceived, fell into transgression.” (1 Timothy 2:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Eve could fellowship with Adam after sinning in her soul,
but neither she nor Adam could fellowship with God. Both had died spiritually
and had lost their human spirit.  See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/A/Adam.html">Adam</a>.</p>
