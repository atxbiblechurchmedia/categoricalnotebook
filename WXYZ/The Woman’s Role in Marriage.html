<h2>The Woman’s Role in Marriage</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If the woman does not have someone to which to respond,
she becomes bitter, frustrated and may practice some form of escapism, such as
clubs, drinking etc. The interrelationship between husband and wife must be one
of cooperation rather than one of competition. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Before marrying, a woman should ask, “Can I willingly
surrender my soul and body to this guy for life?” This submission is mental
rather than sexual. Sex is an expression of this submission, but there must
first of all be the mental attitude. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Agapao</i> love is an unconditional mental attitude
love. Sex is one of the many expressions of that love. Biological differences
in the woman and man indicate that man is the initiator, the woman is the
responder. Man is told to love the woman with mental attitude love. She will
then respond with rapport love. Titus 2:4; Eph. 5:25. </p>

<p class=Verses>“so that they may encourage the young women to love their
husbands, to love their children,” (Titus 2:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the
church and gave Himself up for her,” (Ephesians 5:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Women have certain special roles to play not common to
the male of the human race. The woman may take on the role of a wife in
marriage. She has the responsibility of submission and fulfiller. 1 Peter 3:1; 1
Cor. 11:7-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“In the same way, you wives, be submissive to your own husbands
so that even if any of them are disobedient to the word, they may be won
without a word by the behavior of their wives,” (1 Peter 3:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For a man ought not to have his head covered, since he is the
image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. For man does not
originate from woman, but woman from man; for indeed man was not created for
the woman's sake, but woman for the man's sake. Therefore the woman ought to
have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels. However, in the
Lord, neither is woman independent of man, nor is man independent of woman. For
as the woman originates from the man, so also the man has his birth through the
woman; and all things originate from God.” (1 Corinthians 11:7-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>She has the responsibility to understand in detail her
husband. This is based on the analogy of Christ and the Church, that we might
know Him. She is not responsible to initiate in the authority role. The man is
the head of the wife. She responds to her husband, the capability of which is
dependent in part on his proper expression of Ephesians 5:25.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the
church and gave Himself up for her,” (Ephesians 5:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>She takes care of her own sins. Deut. 24:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Fathers shall not be put to death for their sons, nor
shall sons be put to death for their fathers; everyone shall be put to death
for his own sin.” (Deuteronomy 24:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>She is not responsible for the physical provision for the
home. The man is the provider. However, this does not eliminate women in the
field of work outside the home in business. She is responsible to bear children
to her husband, to perpetuate his name and for personal blessings. The
Scripture likens children to arrows and states that happy is the man whose
quiver is full of them.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Becoming a mother brings a new dimension to life and
greatly complicates it. As a mother, you have to deal with your volition, the
volition of your husband and children and the results of that volition. You are
responsible to teach your children. You have to learn Bible doctrine and how to
stay in fellowship. You have to understand your husband’s authority in the
discipline of the children. Deut. 6:6-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;These words, which I am commanding you today, shall be
on your heart. &quot;You shall teach them diligently to your sons and shall
talk of them when you sit in your house and when you walk by the way and when
you lie down and when you rise up. &quot;You shall bind them as a sign on your
hand and they shall be as frontals on your forehead. &quot;You shall write them
on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.” (Deuteronomy 6:6-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You have to recognize patterns in your life that may
express one or more negative characteristics. You have to realize the
alternative that you choose when you stop in your spiritual growth pattern and become
negative to Bible doctrine. You have to realize the significance of the effect
of your spiritual maturity on your husband as a preservative of him. The
fragrance of memory that a man has regarding the beautiful relationship with
his wife is a great deterrent to his being taken in by some other flattering
female.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You have to understand that this will be an area of
ministry to your husband, whether in the home, in the church, or otherwise. Wives
need to get used to the idea that they will have to communicate on this subject
with their husband. Wives need to see the pattern and expression of negative
volition from the standpoint of how it is expressed through a woman’s makeup.
Negative volition is expressed through promiscuity, fornication,
unpleasantness, argumentativeness, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You have to understand how the woman affects the man or
other men with whom she has contact. Women can either make or wreck the
ministry of the husband. Proverbs makes it very clear that the hazard is to the
men and not to the women. It does not warn the women of staying away from the
wolf, but it does warn the man to stay away from the femme fetale.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The woman has to realize that the man has a greater
susceptibility to falling than the woman. This is true because when a man
begins to listen to the flattery of a woman and begins to become amorous over
her charms, he has entered the sphere of responder. Outside of the marriage
relationship and his own wife, this type of initiation by a woman will destroy
a man. Within the marriage relationship, there is initiation by the wife, and
response by the husband. But, he still is the initiator in that he has set the
stage for his wife’s initiation in their relationship. </p>
