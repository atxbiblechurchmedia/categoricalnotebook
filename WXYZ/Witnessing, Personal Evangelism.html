<h2><a name="_Witnessing,_Personal_Evangelism"></a>Witnessing, Personal
Evangelism</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All believers in the Church Age are mandated to witness
to anyone who has not yet accepted Jesus Christ as their personal Savior. We,
as believers, are all ambassadors for Jesus Christ here on earth. Also,
witnessing or personal evangelism is not related to our spiritual gifts that
each believer receives at salvation, but a part of our full-time Christian
service for the Lord. The principle of prayer in witnessing is presented in
Ephesians 6:18-20. </p>

<p class=Verses>“With all prayer and petition pray at all times in the Spirit,
and with this in view, be on the alert with all perseverance and petition for
all the saints, and pray on my behalf, that utterance may be given to me in the
opening of my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel, for
which I am an ambassador in chains; that in proclaiming it I may speak boldly,
as I ought to speak.” (Ephesians 6:18-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Knowledge of salvation is necessary to evangelize. The
focus of witnessing is the person and work of Jesus Christ. 2 Cor. 5:17-21. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creature; the
old things passed away; behold, new things have come. Now all these things are
from God, who reconciled us to Himself through Christ and gave us the ministry
of reconciliation, namely, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to
Himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and He has committed to us
the word of reconciliation. Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though
God were making an appeal through us; we beg you on behalf of Christ, be
reconciled to God. He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that
we might become the righteousness of God in Him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Corinthians
5:17-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The objective is not to lead the unbeliever to Christ,
but to accurately give them the Gospel information so they can make a decision.
You don’t force them into a decision. You should understand the doctrines of
reconciliation, propitiation, redemption, imputation, justification,
regeneration, and expiation. You must have this <i>epignosis</i> doctrine
information in your soul. Do you? Some people think what you need to know is
the method, techniques, and salesmanship. You must know your subject. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If you are witnessing to a Christian Science
practitioner, you don’t have to know about the woman who started it, likewise
with the other systems of religion. Witnessing for Jesus Christ is the
responsibility of every believer. Acts 1:8; 2 Tim. 4:5; Col. 2:14; Eph. 6:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon
you; and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and
Samaria, and even to the remotest part of the earth.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 1:8,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But you, be sober in all things, endure hardship, do the work
of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Timothy 4:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“having canceled out the certificate of debt consisting of
decrees against us, which was hostile to us; and He has taken it out of the
way, having nailed it to the cross.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Colossians 2:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and having shod YOUR FEET WITH THE PREPARATION OF THE
GOSPEL OF PEACE;&quot;  (Ephesians 6:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Nice people will go to hell. The basis of their
indictment is rejection of the work of Jesus Christ and their reliance on human
good. Jesus Christ paid the penalty for all of mankind’s sins. He rejected
human good as worthless. Human good is works or “righteous deeds” in Isaiah
64:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For all of us have become like one who is unclean, And
all our righteous deeds are like a filthy garment; And all of us wither like a
leaf, And our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.&quot;  (Isaiah 64:6,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Effectiveness and clarity in witnessing depends on the
believer’s understanding of the Last Judgment, the Great White Throne Judgment.
Rev. 20:11-15; Heb. 6:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat upon it, from
whose presence earth and heaven fled away, and no place was found for them. And
I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books
were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life; and the
dead were judged from the things which were written in the books, according to
their deeds. And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and Hades
gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged, every one of them
according to their deeds. Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of
fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire. And if anyone’s name was not
found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation
20:11-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore leaving the elementary teaching about the Christ,
let us press on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from
dead works and of faith toward God,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 6:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Holy Spirit is the sovereign executive of witnessing.
Witnessing is impossible apart from the ministry of the Holy Spirit. The
unbeliever does not have any basis for taking in and understanding divine
information. They have no human spirit, but they do have a soul that is
depraved. So the Holy Spirit must act as a human spirit to make the Gospel
understandable to them. You present pertinent Gospel information, the rest is
up to the Holy Spirit to make it clear! Eph. 2:1; 1 Cor. 2:14; John 16:8-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And you were dead in your trespasses and sins,” (Ephesians
2:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But a natural man does not accept the things of the
Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them,
because they are spiritually appraised.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 2:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““And He, when He comes, will convict the world concerning sin
and righteousness and judgment; concerning sin, because they do not believe in
Me; and concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father and you no longer
see Me; and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been
judged.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 16:8-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Believer’s Weapon in Evangelism</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pertinent content of the Word of God, the Gospel, is
the believer’s weapon in evangelism. The Gospel is the power of God with
reference to salvation. The Gospel is the caliber of our weapon. When believers
come into contact with the enemy, they are to use their weapon of the Word of
God. The unbeliever is the target. Heb. 4:12; Eph. 6:17; 1 Cor. 1:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any
two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of
both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the
heart.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And take THE HELMET OF SALVATION, and the sword of the Spirit,
which is the word of God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 6:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are
perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Corinthians 1:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Bible is the absolute standard for Truth. The Bible
is the accuracy of our weapon. 2 Peter 1:14-15; 2 Peter 1:19-21. </p>

<p class=Verses>“knowing that the laying aside of my earthly dwelling is
imminent, as also our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me. And I will also
be diligent that at any time after my departure you will be able to call these
things to mind.” (2 Peter 1:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So we have the prophetic word made more sure, to which you do
well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns
and the morning star arises in your hearts. But know this first of all, that no
prophecy of Scripture is a matter of one's own interpretation, for no prophecy
was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke
from God.” (2 Peter 1:19-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Bible is the source of the Gospel. The Bible is also
the arsenal from which our weapon comes. Luke 16:28-31; 1 Cor. 15:3-4. </p>

<p class=Verses>“for I have five brothers—in order that he may warn them, so
that they will not also come to this place of torment.' &quot;But Abraham said,
'They have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear them.' &quot;But he said, 'No,
father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent!'
&quot;But he said to him, 'If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets,
they will not be persuaded even if someone rises from the dead.'&quot;” (Luke
16:28-31, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also
received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that
He was buried, and that He was raised on the third day according to the
Scriptures,” (1 Corinthians 15:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Bible is “the Mind of Christ.” Jesus Christ is the
designer of our weapon. 1 Cor. 2:16. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT
HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.” (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Bible is divine power that provides the impact of our
weapon. Heb. 4:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any
two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of
both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the
heart.” (Hebrews 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Bible or the Word of God never returns void. Specific
verses and doctrines in the Bible are the aim of our weapon. Isaiah 55:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So will My word be which goes forth from My mouth; It will not
return to Me empty, Without accomplishing what I desire, And without succeeding
in the matter for which I sent it.” (Isaiah 55:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Bible or the Word of God endures forever. The eternal
Word of God provides the permanence of our weapon. Luke 21:33;, 1 Peter 1:25. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not
pass away.” (Luke 21:33, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“BUT THE WORD OF THE LORD ENDURES FOREVER.&quot; And this is
the word which was preached to you.” (1 Peter 1:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Dynamics of Witnessing</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer is the agent of witnessing. Acts 1:8; Eph.
6:15; Eph. 6:20; 2 Tim. 4:5. </p>

<p class=Verses>“but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon
you; and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and
Samaria, and even to the remotest part of the earth.&quot;” (Acts 1:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and having shod YOUR FEET WITH THE PREPARATION OF THE GOSPEL
OF PEACE;” (Ephesians 6:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in proclaiming it
I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.” (Ephesians 6:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But you, be sober in all things, endure hardship, do the work
of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.” (2 Timothy 4:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The dynamics of witnessing depend upon the believer’s proper
mental attitude. You are not going to be effective in witnessing if you are
ashamed of the Gospel. You are not going to be effective if you have no
capacity to love the Lord Jesus Christ and to understand and experience His
grace. You need to be consistent in your daily intake of Bible doctrine and the
function of the grace apparatus for perception as it relates to Gospel
information. Rom. 1:14-16; Eph. 6:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians, both
to the wise and to the foolish. So, for my part, I am eager to preach the
gospel to you also who are in Rome. For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it
is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first
and also to the Greek.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 1:14-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and having shod YOUR FEET WITH THE PREPARATION OF THE GOSPEL
OF PEACE;” (Ephesians 6:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are two areas of witnessing and they always go
together. They are the testimony of the lips and the testimony of the life.
This is coordination of the character and speech. One does not exist without
the other. 2 Cor. 5:17-21; 2 Cor. 3:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“being manifested that you are a letter of Christ, cared for by
us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets
of stone but on tablets of human hearts.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Corinthians 3:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is very definite reward for witnessing. This reward
results from divine good production.  Rewards in heaven are an extension of
maturing spiritually. They simply commemorate the grace of God. 1 Cor. 3:11-16;
2 Cor. 5:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For no man can lay a foundation other than the one which is
laid, which is Jesus Christ. Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold,
silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, each man’s work will become evident;
for the day will show it because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire
itself will test the quality of each man’s work. If any man’s work which he has
built on it remains, he will receive a reward. If any man’s work is burned up,
he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire. Do
you not know that you are a temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in
you?”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 3:11-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so
that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body, according to what
he has done, whether good or bad.” (2 Corinthians 5:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some people may say, “Well, I’m going to heaven and I’m
going to be happy there, so is this reward business going to make me any
happier? What does it add? Isn’t this being a little pushy going around
witnessing to get a reward in heaven?” People who talk like that have no
concept of grace and the plan of God. The believer’s spiritual growth is so
designed to reflect the glory of God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>These rewards do not reflect any personal glory, but
reflect the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ in us. They reflect His glory, not
ours. The reason people are confused on rewards is that they are not grace
oriented. Everything in heaven is going to glorify God.</p>
