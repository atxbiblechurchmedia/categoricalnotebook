<h2><a name="_The_Virtuous_Wife_1"></a>The Virtuous Wife and Mother</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Proverbs 31:10-31 presents the doctrine of the Virtuous
Wife and Mother using an acrostic when viewed in the original Hebrew. An
acrostic is a poem or series of lines in which certain letters, usually the
first in each line, form a name, motto, or message when read in sequence. An
acrostic gives the reader two for one and the etymology of the word emphasizes
one of these two. The  Greek word for “acrostic” is <i>akrostikhis</i>, which
is a combination of Greek <i>akros</i> meaning at the end or outermost and <i>stikhos</i>
meaning a row or line of verse. Literally, <i>akrostikhis</i> means “the line
at the end” emphasizing the fact that an acrostic has in addition to horizontal
rows a vertical row formed of the letters at the end or start of each line. In
ancient manuscripts in which a line of verse did not necessarily correspond to
a line of text, an acrostic would have looked particularly striking with each
of its lines standing by itself and beginning with a capital letter. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Prosperity and Happiness Are Based on Virtue</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first Hebrew letter of Proverbs 31:10 is  <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>א</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>  </span>or Aleph and represents an ox which
represented prosperity in an agricultural economy in Old Testament times. It
also illustrates the principle that the height of human prosperity and
happiness is the man with virtue and the right kind of woman for him brought
together by God. The term “an excellent wife” in Proverbs 31:10 means a wife of
strength, ability, integrity, or valor. Here, it is a technical word for
capacity or virtue and represents the woman with virtue and capacity. Eccl.
9:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“An excellent wife, who can find? For her worth is far above
jewels.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 31:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Enjoy life with the woman whom you love all the days of your
fleeting life which He has given to you under the sun; for this is your reward
in life and in your toil in which you have labored under the sun.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ecclesiastes
9:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Proverbs 31:10 says she is worth far more than jewels and
is referring to a pearl, not gems mined from the ground. Pearls come from
oysters and are formed from a grain of sand irritating the oyster. As a defense
mechanism, the oyster secretes layers of a substance called nacre, which coats
the sand grain and gradually builds up to create a beautiful pearl. This is
symbolic of the man’s woman waiting for him. She is the pearl immersed in the
water of Bible doctrine. Looking for Bible doctrine in her soul is the only way
to find her! </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The plural Hebrew word for “pearl” is <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>פְּנִינִים</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(peninim).
The pearl is about the only precious gem not related to the ground. It is
related to the water, oysters, and sand. A genuine pearl has perfect symmetry.
The virtuous woman has symmetry of soul, body, and most importantly, symmetry
of compatibility. Everything about her is designed for her man by God the
Father. Jesus Christ designed each man personally with this in mind. Everyone
else is excluded. Whosoever discovers a virtuous woman with spiritual soul
rapport with him receives what is good and obtains an object of delight from
the Lord. Prov. 18:22. </p>

<p class=Verses>“He who finds a wife finds a good thing And obtains favor from
the LORD.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 18:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The phrase “who finds” in Proverbs 18:22 in the Hebrew is
the qal imperfect of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>מצא</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (mâtsâ’) and means who can discover. The
woman of capacity is the woman in God’s plan designed and destined for every
man. How does the man know she is the right kind of woman for him? Size, shape,
coloring, bone structure are not mentioned here because women come in all
sizes, shapes, and descriptions. Even the same woman is entirely different from
time to time. The virtuous woman will have certain physical and soul attributes
that make her attractive to the man she meets. If the right combination of soul
and physical attributes or “chemistry” are recognized by each other based on
their application of Bible doctrine in their souls, the relationship will
continue to grow. The woman is brought to the man by God, so the man must take
the initiative with a gracious and loving attitude. Some guys are still waiting
around to be introduced. The man makes the identification first and if it is
true and not phony, she will begin to make some identifications of her own as
they get to know each other.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ecclesiastes 7:26-29 is a passage of bitterness because
Solomon could never find the woman he thought he wanted. He had “discovered” a
lot of women and had become bitter because they never lined up with his list of
requirements. He had discovered everything, but never could find a woman that
had that combination of physical chemistry and soul rapport that he expected.
Unfortunately, he had little virtue love in his soul and was unable to
recognize it in the women he looked for. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And I discovered more bitter than death the woman whose heart
is snares and nets, whose hands are chains. One who is pleasing to God will
escape from her, but the sinner will be captured by her. “Behold, I have
discovered this,” says the Preacher, “adding one thing to another to find an
explanation, which I am still seeking but have not found. I have found one man
among a thousand, but I have not found a woman among all these. “Behold, I have
found only this, that God made men upright, but they have sought out many
devices.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ecclesiastes 7:26-29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Prosperity for the human race is a virtuous man
identifying his “opposite number” that exhibits the same soul rapport. That is
the ultimate in human happiness. Some of you think prosperity is having money,
traveling, a nice home, clothes, and partying. It’s finding the virtuous woman
that God meant for you to find. God also taught you the Bible doctrine in your
soul that allowed you to recognize her.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Home Is Where Your Woman Lives</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first letter of the original Hebrew of Proverbs 31:11
is  <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>ב</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>  </span>or Beth and
represents a house or dwelling and illustrates the principle that where a
husband’s virtuous wife is located becomes his home. To the husband, home is
not a building, but wherever his wife is located. To the wife, home is wherever
her husband is located. </p>

<p class=Verses>“The heart of her husband trusts in her, And he will have no
lack of gain.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 31:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 31:11, “The heart of her husband” refers to the
right lobe of his soul or heart (<span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>לב</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> - lêb in the Hebrew). This includes the
frame of reference, memory center, conscience, vocabulary storage, categories,
norms and standards and divine viewpoint. When he finds his wife to be, all
these facets of the heart have an application. She also has a right lobe or
heart filled with Bible doctrine. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Long before there is any touching, there is a mutual
frame of reference and mutual conscience. There is a soul climax or soul
burning (not libido). The word “trusts” is the qal perfect of <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>בּטח</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> (bâṭach) and means to have confidence. It means that he has
perfect confidence in his wife when he is away from her. The opposite is also
true for the wife having trust or confidence in her husband when he is away
from home on a business trip.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The right lobe of her soul sees her husband as lord. Only
a virtuous woman who has been discovered by her soul mate can call him lord! No
virtuous woman ever finds her man until her soul and her body looks at that one
man and think of him as lord. This was the case for Bathsheba in 1 Kings 1:17
and 1 Kings 1:31 and with Sarah in 1 Peter 3:5-8. </p>

<p class=Verses>“She said to him, “My lord, you swore to your maidservant by
the LORD your God, saying, ‘Surely your son Solomon shall be king after me and
he shall sit on my throne.’“&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Kings 1:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the ground, and
prostrated herself before the king and said, “May my lord King David live
forever.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Kings 1:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For in this way in former times the holy women also, who hoped
in God, used to adorn themselves, being submissive to their own husbands; just
as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, and you have become her children if
you do what is right without being frightened by any fear. You husbands in the
same way, live with your wives in an understanding way, as with someone weaker,
since she is a woman; and show her honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life,
so that your prayers will not be hindered. To sum up, all of you be harmonious,
sympathetic, brotherly, kindhearted, and humble in spirit;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Peter
3:5-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The virtuous husband and wife should have full confidence
whenever the other is away from home. The husband should have full trust in his
wife that she will not flirt, tease, drink with some other guy, become involved
with another guy in some way, or be unfaithful sexually, socially, or mentally.
This is the kind of woman every military man must have! When he is out fighting
wars and doing his job, he has perfect confidence that his wife thousands of
miles away is totally faithful to him in every way. Probably more than any
other profession, the military needs the virtuous woman in the marriage. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A man can’t have “love security of the soul” with any
woman, but his wife or potential wife. Other women may be attracted to the
husband and such advances can be an ego booster, but responding to such
advances shows a lack of virtue in the man. Of course, the opposite is also
true for the wife who may be gorgeous and she may know it, but in her soul, her
virtue love for her husband easily overrides the sin nature’s temptation to
respond to anyone but her husband. That is soul rapport based on Bible doctrine
in the soul! This soul rapport is what God has planned for the believer in
marriage who is positive to Bible doctrine.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Once a woman finds the man for her, she is just not
interested in any one else! The result is that she does not flirt with other
men, she does not want to be a tease, and most importantly, she is not going to
smile at her husband and think about some other guy. When other men ask her to
go out, she makes it perfectly clear to them that she has no interest in them
and that they are out of line for asking. If some friends ask her to go to a
party when her husband is away to cheer her up, she tells them that she doesn’t
need cheering up. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>A Husband’s Wife Is His Pleasure in Life</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first Hebrew letter of Proverbs 31:12 is  <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>ג</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'><span dir=LTR></span> </span><span
lang=HE> </span>or Gimel and represents a camel which refers to a traveler who
has gained much knowledge about different subjects. The camel was a blessing in
ancient times because it brought the merchandise and goods that pleased people.
The principle illustrated here is that a husband’s virtuous wife is his
pleasure in life. </p>

<p class=Verses>“She does him good and not evil All the days of her life.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs
31:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The phrase “She does him good” in Proverbs 31:12 refers
to the virtuous wife who does not make life miserable for her husband. The
Hebrew word for good is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>טוֹב</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (tob) and is the same word as in Genesis
2:18. She shows him a lot of good and causes him a lot of good. This is the way
a virtuous woman is to function.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD God said, “It is not good for the man to be
alone; I will make him a helper suitable for him.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis 2:18,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The phrase “and not evil” in Proverbs 31:12 refers to the
fact that a wife with Bible doctrine in her soul brings pleasure and happiness
into the life of her husband, not trouble or difficulty. The phrase “all the
days of her life” refers to the fact that she lives one day at a time. This
phrase is intensive in the Hebrew and emphasizes that every day she does him
good and not evil.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Wife with Virtue Makes Many Decisions to Please
Her Husband</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first Hebrew letter of Proverbs 31:13 is  <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>ד</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>  </span>or Daleth and represents a door and
refers to decisions. The virtuous wife makes many decisions to please her husband.
It’s not necessarily things she wants to do, but things she decides to do that
are based on virtue love in her soul for her husband. Some of you ladies may
not think of yourselves as good housekeepers. How you keep your house is not
even an issue in this verse. In fact, this passage indicates that some men have
wives who are business women. </p>

<p class=Verses>“She looks for wool and flax And works with her hands in
delight.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 31:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some husbands have wives that are good housekeepers and
others have wives who have careers in the business world. This passage is not a
treatise on good housekeeping because that is a matter of talent, energy, and
ability. Any unbelieving wife can keep a beautiful home. Some of you single
women may think that you will never find a good husband because you can’t cook
or keep house. That won’t make any difference when you meet the right guy and
recognize the Bible doctrine in his soul. The combined physical chemistry and
soul rapport will tell you if he is the one for you or not.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The phrase “she looks” in Proverbs 31:13 is the qal
perfect of the Hebrew word <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>דּרשׁ</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (dârash) which means she searches
diligently for wool and flax. This means that she dresses to please her husband.
Wool and flax were materials used for the manufacturing of clothing in the
ancient world. The wife made her own clothes or bought them off of a caravan.
Wool clothing was used for colder weather and flax clothing for warmer weather.
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The principle illustrated here is the virtuous wife
dresses to please her husband and no one else. She cleans her house for the
same reason. She does not dress to impress other women or other men! Her soul
is so occupied with her husband that she is motivated to always appear in
clothing that he appreciates. There is something wrong with a woman who dresses
to impress other women or other men such as celebrities or relative strangers. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The virtuous wife only dresses and undresses for her
husband. She is always searching diligently for the things that will please her
husband. Some men complain that their wives spend so much time shopping. Don’t
knock it if she’s doing it to please you! If she goes to the dress shop to look
nice for you, you have got to have rocks in your head to knock it! And you
ladies, if you are taking care of everybody else’s needs and you are neglecting
your husband and your house, you should reset your priorities back to your husband
and place others’ needs down on the list. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For the single man, if you are dating a girl who dresses
to impress women or other people who she may or may not have met or dresses in
her finest to go to a party where you are not present - you are probably not
dating your wife to be. This is a good test! If, when you are gone, the woman
you are dating goes to a party and dresses up in her finest which you have
never even seen yet, she is probably not the one for you. If she is more interested
in pleasing others than you, then you should “get the message” and move on.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The principle here is that she is making decisions where
you are not even in the picture. If you are not in her soul, she is probably
not the one for you. A wife with Bible doctrine in her soul should do things
the way she thinks her husband wants them to be so when he gets home, he is
pleased with what he sees. The wife should clean the house the way she thinks
her husband would want it. She should dress the way she thinks her husband
would want her to dress. When she cook meals, she should want to cook them
exactly the way she knows her husband likes them. She should also manage the
household affairs the way she and her husband have agreed they should be
managed. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The phrase “works with her hands in delight” in Proverbs
31:13 means she literally works with her hands and has her husband in her mind.
The drudgery is gone because of what she is thinking. I understand that
housework such as making beds, cleaning rugs and carpets, and cooking meals is
often drudgery. However, the wife with Bible doctrine in her soul does these
things willingly because her husband is also in her soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Wife with Virtue Love Makes an Extra Effort to
Please Her Husband</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first Hebrew letter of Proverbs 31:14 is <span
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'> </span><span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>ה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'><span dir=LTR></span> </span> or He and
represents a window and the wife’s perspective. There are at least three types
of wives categorized for the husband in this passage. The first category is the
domestic woman. The second category is the business woman. The third category
is the woman who supports a handicapped man, or an evangelist or pastor-teacher
in training who is unable to work while devoting all of his time to the intense
training for the ministry.</p>

<p class=Verses>“She is like merchant ships; She brings her food from afar.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs
31:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Proverbs 31:14 illustrates the principle that the virtuous
wife has become like the merchant’s ships of the ancient world in that she
makes the extra effort to get foods that are pleasing to her husband. The wife doesn’t
spend all of her time at the quick local grocery stores that offer a poor
selection. She is so occupied with her husband’s preferences that she makes an
extra effort to please him.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the ancient world, ships would sail out from the
Mediterranean Sea through the Strait of Gibraltar and trade up and down the
west coast of Africa. They were very adventuresome. Solomon sent out merchant
ships that came back with apes and peacocks. So, like the merchant ships, she
is adventuresome for her husband. The phrase “She brings” is the hiphil
imperfect and causative active voice of the Hebrew word <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>בּוא</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span>
(bô’) and means that she causes it to be brought. Just as a merchant ship goes
great distances to find interesting things, so the spiritually mature wife goes
to extra effort to bring something to her husband that is pleasing to him. She
looks out of the window of life and does everything with him in perspective.
The literal translation of Proverbs 31:14 is, “She has become like the ships of
the merchant man, from afar she causes her food to be brought.” The analogy is
that she places her primary interest in her husband which could be associated
with many different things. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Virtuous Wife’s Mental Attitude Is the Key to the
Household</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first Hebrew letter of Proverbs 31:15 is  <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>ו</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>  </span>or Waw and represents a nail, peg or
hook. The principle here is that the virtuous wife is the peg upon which the
household hangs. Her mental attitude is the key to the household. The household
includes the wife, her husband, children, maids, and everything else. The husband,
as this passage teaches, can be out of sorts and things still move along. The
children can be out of sorts and things still go on. When the wife is out of
sorts, it’s the end of the line and nothing goes right. A man may take
undeserved criticism and be under pressures in the working world, but to come
home to a wife who has not handled her responsibilities to manage the household
will really make work tough for him. </p>

<p class=Verses>“She rises also while it is still night And gives food to her
household And portions to her maidens.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 31:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Proverbs 31:15 indicates that the virtuous wife is the
key to the household. The husband may be the king in the house, but it is the
queen who is important. The phrase “She rises” is the qal imperfect of the
Hebrew word <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>קוּם</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (qûm) pronounced “koom” and means to rise
up for a purpose. Some people get up in the morning without a purpose. They
just wander through the day trying to find themselves. Life has no meaning for
them and they have no capacity for life. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The phrase “while it is still night” indicates an
excellent mental attitude. You have to have it when it’s dark. She is motivated
with occupation with her husband. She places her love for him above her
personal comfort. It is not necessarily still comfortable for her to get up
while it is still dark, but her husband’s happiness is more important to her
than her own comfort. This is a phenomenal mental attitude! Women are not
constructed usually to get up very early - especially before everyone else.
When you find a man who is more important to you than your own comfort, you
know you have found the right kind of man for you.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The phrase “gives food to her household” means that she
sees to it that all of the household is fed on time and that the “launching pad”
of energy for her husband is ready when expected to get him going in the
morning for work. She also sees that everything is in order for their children
because they are a reminder of something she shares with him. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The phrase “and portions to her maidens” means that she
has assigned jobs to those hired to help her manage the household. The
principle here is that she is the key to the running of the house. She may do
it herself, or she may have help. The woman is head of her household. She gives
food and tells her maids what to do.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Business Woman</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first Hebrew letter of Proverbs 31:16 is  <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>ז</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> or Zayin and represents a sword or weapon. It represents the wife
with virtue love who is aggressive in her responsiveness. This is the business
type of woman. The phrase “She considers” is the qal perfect of the Hebrew word
<span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>זמם</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> (zâmam) and means to consider a business proposition. This is
a woman in business who is using good business thinking. The principle here is
that all wives are not household types. That goes way back to the ancient
world. Women were in business then and women are in business today. Some wives
are in the office while others are in the home. They do not follow a pattern. </p>

<p class=Verses>“She considers a field and buys it; From her earnings she
plants a vineyard.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 31:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The phrase “buys it” in Proverbs 31:16 is the qal
imperfect of <span lang=HE dir=RTL>לקח</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> (lâqach) in the Hebrew and means to seize.  She sees
possibilities of the land and she jumps in there and gets it before anyone
else. She outdid her male competitors. She had a good business mind and she
pounced on it. She got it right now while everybody else was still consulting
with their board of directors. Proverbs 31:16 goes on to say that with her
capital, she plants a vineyard. This wife pleases her husband with business
deals, just like another wife pleases her husband in the home. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Husband Is a Protective Enclosure for His Wife</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first Hebrew letter of Proverbs 31:17 is  <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>ח</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>  </span>or Heth and represents an enclosure or a
fenced-in area. The principle here is that the wife is always enclosed by her husband.
She is inside of the fence. No matter whether she is a domestic manager or
whether she is a business woman, she belongs to one man only! Her soul and her
body are at his disposal. What does a woman do when she is fenced in? No two
women are the same. </p>

<p class=Verses>“She girds herself with strength And makes her arms strong.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs
31:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The phrase “She girds herself with strength” means to
encircle and has to do with her sexual response to her husband and means
literally that she encircles her sexual response with his strength. His
strength is her protection. They have a soul relationship, but this describes
the physical relationship. The important point is that she responds to only one
man! She is always faithful to him. Sex is designed for the husband and wife in
marriage only.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The phrase “And makes her arms strong” in Proverbs 31:17
is the piel imperfect of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>אמץ</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(‘âmats) in the
Hebrew and means to encourage. She encourages him with her arms as in her
embrace. She embraces within the fence of her husband. Remember ladies, friendship
love (<i>phileo</i>) is not a touching love. You can have male friends, but no
touching! The embrace is only for your husband.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Wife with Virtue Associates with Her Husband</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first Hebrew letter of Proverbs 31:18 is  <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>ט</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>  </span>or Teth and represents a relationship or
an association and means to roll together. The principle here is that the virtuous
wife associates with her husband. The word “senses” means to perceive and the
word “gain” means to profit. She perceives that her husband is good for her
always. The phrase “is good” comes from the Hebrew word <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>טוֹב</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span>
(tob) and means they have a good relationship around the clock.</p>

<p class=Verses>“She senses that her gain is good; Her lamp does not go out at
night.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 31:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The phrase “Her lamp does not go out at night”
illustrates that her lamp (prosperity and happiness) shall not go out. The
phrase “go out” is the qal imperfect of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>כּבה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (kâbâh) in
the Hebrew and means to be extinguished by night which refers to adversity or a
disaster period. This is the quintessence of happiness. She is both stimulated
and in a state of permanent happiness because of her relationship and
association with her husband. This is maximum human happiness. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Wife Is Occupied with Things That Bless Her
Husband</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first Hebrew letter of Proverbs 31:19 is  <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>י</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>  </span>or Yodh and represents the hand. The
principle here is that the hands of the wife are occupied with those things
that bless her husband. She does not give him cause for concern. She does not
flirt with or tease other men. She does not play games and is not vindictive.
The hand of the virtuous wife is constructive, not destructive. </p>

<p class=Verses>“She stretches out her hands to the distaff, And her hands
grasp the spindle.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 31:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The phrase “She stretches out her hands to the distaff”
refers to a staff on a turning basin where yarn wraps around it and feeds the
sewing machine. The result is woven cloth. The phrase “And her hands grasp the
spindle” is the piel imperfect of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>שׁלח</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (shâlach)
in the Hebrew and means to handle the machine with dexterity. The meaning here
is that she has skillful hands and fingers. It does not mean that all women
have to sew. It means her hands are an extension of her soul. In her soul, she
is occupied with one man and is doing something to please that one man. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Spiritually Mature Wife Is the Overflow of Grace
to Others</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first Hebrew letter of Proverbs 31:20 is  <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>ך</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>  </span>or Kaph and represents the hollow of a
hand. The principle here is that the spiritually mature wife is the overflow of
grace to others. Because she is so happy with her husband, this happiness
overflows to others.</p>

<p class=Verses>“She extends her hand to the poor, And she stretches out her
hands to the needy.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 31:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The phrase “she stretches out her hand to the needy” uses
the Hebrew word <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>פּרשׂ</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>(pâraś) and means to extend out or to spread with her hands. This also
means to extend her help to the poor, afflicted, and the needy. She does this
for people with genuine needs, not to impress others.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Wife Anticipates Certain Types of Disaster and
Heads Them off</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first Hebrew letter of Proverbs 31:21 is  <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>ל</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>  </span>or Lamedh and represents an ox goad and
represents that she keeps the ox moving in the fields. The principle here is
that the virtuous wife’s faithfulness to her husband enables her to prepare for
pressures and disasters in life.</p>

<p class=Verses>“She is not afraid of the snow for her household, For all her
household are clothed with scarlet.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 31:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the phrase “not afraid of the snow” contains the
negative plus the qal imperfect of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>יָרֵא</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(yare) in the Hebrew and means to
not be afraid. The snow represents the disasters in life that can be
anticipated. In this case, everyone who lives in the north knows it is going to
snow in winter. They anticipate what will be needed to keep warm because they
know it is going to get cold. The virtuous wife anticipates certain types of
disaster and heads them off. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The phrase “For all her household are clothed with
scarlet” contains the qal passive participle of the Hebrew word <span dir=RTL></span><span
dir=RTL><span dir=RTL></span> </span><span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>לבשׁ</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span>(lâbash) and
means “are being clothed.” The phrase “with scarlet” contains the Hebrew word <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שׁני</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> (shânı̂y) which is a dual word and means double red clothing
or double scarlet clothing warm and rich in color to keep you warm in extreme
cold. This also refers to a woman’s love instincts whereby she clothes her husband
with a double warmth of her love (soul and sex).</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are certain times of the year when snow and cold
can be anticipated, long before the snow arrives. Therefore, long before that,
the spiritually mature wife has made provision for such cold weather. Once a virtuous
woman finds her husband to be and marries him, there are certain instincts of
love which head off many disasters. Her instincts of love keep her
concentrating on him. She doesn’t flirt, tease, try to hurt others, or play
games to make her husband jealous. She no longer depends upon parties, outside
friends, or fun and games. She doesn’t try to hurt her husband in her social
life or activities. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Well Is the Virtuous Wife</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first Hebrew letter of Proverbs 31:22 is  <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>ם</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>  </span>or Mem and represents water and is often
used to represent Bible doctrine. It also means water in a fountain or water in
a well and is used for a virtuous husband and wife relationship. The well is
the virtuous wife. The fountain is the sex drive of the husband. Eph. 5:26; Prov.
5:15-20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“She makes coverings for herself; Her clothing is fine linen
and purple.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 31:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“so that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the
washing of water with the word,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 5:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Drink water from your own cistern And fresh water from your
own well. Should your springs be dispersed abroad, Streams of water in the
streets? Let them be yours alone And not for strangers with you. Let your
fountain be blessed, And rejoice in the wife of your youth. As a loving hind
and a graceful doe, Let her breasts satisfy you at all times; Be exhilarated
always with her love. For why should you, my son, be exhilarated with an
adulteress And embrace the bosom of a foreigner?”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 5:15-20,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The phrase “She makes” in Proverbs 31:22 is the qal
perfect of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>עָשָׂה</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (asah) in the Hebrew. In the ancient
world, the woman had to manufacture the accessories for the bed. The phrase “coverings
for herself” refers to her clothing which was fine linen and purple. The qal
active participle of the Hebrew word for clothing is <span dir=RTL></span><span
dir=RTL><span dir=RTL></span> </span><span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>לבוּשׁ</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span>(lebûsh) and
means she is being clothed constantly. Silk is very fine white fabric and
purple signifies wearing beautiful clothing for her husband, even expensive.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is just the opposite of many females today. The wife
should make the bed as beautiful as possible and in the house makes herself as
beautiful as possible. The wife who dresses her bed and her body to please her husband
is fantastic. Many wives hang around the house looking like a zombie. The only
time they will dress up is when they go out. If you look terrible at the start
of the day when your husband is around, great through the part when he is gone
and then back in the grubbies when he is home, that is abnormal! This is all
backwards! </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ladies are not to dress up to impress a bunch of other
women. Would you rather receive compliments from your husband or from some
female acquaintance? This also applies to you single ladies. Some of you have
little personal discipline. Someday the right kind of man is going to come into
your life and he’s going to expect you to look good when he is around. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The spiritually mature wife should make herself
physically attractive to her husband through proper dress, but more importantly
she should make herself spiritually attractive to her husband through Bible
doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The word “couch” in Song of Solomon 1:16 refers to the
bed and the fact that the bed is to be the most attractive piece of furniture
in the whole house. It ought to be better than anything else. She reflects her
mental attitude in the way she decorates the bedroom. Remember, your bedroom is
to be a private room between you and your husband. People generally do not see
it. Lots of you spend all your money on your living room. That’s where you see
all your friends and that’s your showplace. You should dress up your bedroom to
be the most attractive room in the house. </p>

<p class=Verses>““How handsome you are, my beloved, And so pleasant! Indeed,
our couch is luxuriant!”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Song of Solomon 1:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Husband Can Concentrate on His Job Without
Distraction</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first Hebrew letter of Proverbs 31:23 is  <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>ן</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span> or Nun and represents a fish standing up
on its tail and represents concentration. The husband of the virtuous wife can
concentrate on his job without distraction. He can concentrate on his job if he
doesn’t have problems at home, or an alcoholic at home stumbling over the
furniture. The principle is that the wife makes it possible for her husband to
leave the house and concentrate on his profession, on his job, whatever he has
to do in life.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Her husband is known in the gates, When he sits among the
elders of the land.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 31:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The phrase “Her husband” in Proverbs 31:23 uses the
Hebrew word <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>בּעל</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (ba‛al) and means her lord and master.
Things really settle down and get sorted out when a wife can look at her
husband and think of him as lord. The phrase “is known in the gates” contains
the niphil participle of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>ידע</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (yâda‛) in the Hebrew indicating that the
husband is an administrator of city government. This refers to the meeting of
the city council. It means literally that he is her lord when he sits among the
rulers of the land. This is a place of prominence and authority. The principle
here is that the virtuous wife compliments and implements, but never competes
with her husband. She is his glory. She stimulates him and seduces him, but
does not belittle or criticize him. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Wife Supports Her Husband</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first Hebrew letter of Proverbs 31:24 is  <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>ס</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>  </span>or Samekh and represents a prop, fulcrum,
or support. The principle here is that the virtuous wife supports her husband
with fanatical loyalty and love. The woman in this verse supported her husband
and earned the living because the husband was handicapped. This is the third
category of the virtuous wife previously discussed. </p>

<p class=Verses>“She makes linen garments and sells them, And supplies belts to
the tradesmen.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 31:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>She does not take away from his masculinity. She does not
compete with him, does not put him down, and does not ridicule him. The Hebrew
word for “makes” is the qal imperfect of <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>עָשָׂה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(asah) and
means she manufactures it. The Hebrew word for “linen” is <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>סדין</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(sâdı̂yn)
and means undergarments. The Hebrew word for “sells” is the qal imperfect of <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>מכר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(mâkar).
The Hebrew word for “supplies” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>נתן</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(nâthan) and means she sells on
consignment undergarments she has made to the Phoenicians or Canaanites. They
then traveled throughout the ancient world and sold them. The fact that her
husband was not earning the wages is a matter of privacy and never hinders the
relationship. You should thank the Lord that you are not in this situation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Wife Is the Glory of Her Husband</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first Hebrew letter of Proverbs 31:25 is  <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>ע</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>  </span>or Ayin and represents a fountain and an
eye. Here, it refers to the fountain as the male sex drive as in Proverbs 5:15
and Proverbs 5:18. This refers again to the fact that the virtuous wife is the
glory of her husband and she wears his glory in her soul. This verse emphasizes
the glory of the woman’s soul, which includes a woman having a sense of humor. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Strength and dignity are her clothing, And she smiles at the
future.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 31:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Drink water from your own cistern And fresh water from your
own well.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 5:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Let your fountain be blessed, And rejoice in the wife of your
youth.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew word for “strength” in Proverbs 31:25 is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>עז</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> (‛ôz) and means a fortification, stability, glory, majesty, and
splendor. Here, it denotes soul stability, soul majesty, soul glory, and soul
splendor from her relationship with her husband. The whole point is the inner
beauty of soul based on Bible doctrine. The Hebrew word for “dignity” in
Proverbs 31:25 is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>הדר</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (hâdâr) and means glamor or ornamental
glamor. The Hebrew word for “smiles” is the qal imperfect of <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שׂחק</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> (śâchaq) and means she will laugh at the next day. It means a
very deep seated laughter based on a relaxed mental attitude, humor, and her
soul’s inner beauty. She keeps on laughing because of the double portion of
grace given to her from God. She has received grace from learning Bible
doctrine and by having her husband.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Why is she laughing? She laughs because her husband is
with her, they have a perfect relationship of soul and body, and her soul is
prepared for the next day. The laughter here refers to the total satisfaction
of a wife-husband relationship which means soul and body. At this point, in the
presence of her husband, she is not clothed with anything else. Her body and
soul are naked to him and she receives maximum satisfaction so she is fulfilled
and can laugh at the next day. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In this context, there are three categories of women.
There is the housewife who laughs at the fact that she will be around the house
working the next day. There is the business woman who laughs at the fact that
she will be around the office the next day. She has her loving husband at the
end of the day! There is the bread-winning woman who laughs because she is
going to have a tough day tomorrow because she has to reach a certain quota for
the Phoenician traders. Instead of dreading, instead of becoming weary about
tomorrow, she laughs! This is spiritual self-confidence regarding the future.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Virtuous Wife Speaks Wisdom</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first Hebrew letter of Proverbs 31:26 is  <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>פ</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>  </span>or Pe and represents the mouth. This
deals with verbal conversation between the wife and husband. When she opens her
mouth, her soul is turned inside out. Wisdom comes out when she talks. </p>

<p class=Verses>“She opens her mouth in wisdom, And the teaching of kindness is
on her tongue.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 31:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew word for “opens” in Proverbs 31:26 is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>פָּתַח</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> (pathach) and means to connect the thoughts of the soul with
verbal or audible communication. The literal translation of this phrase is, “Her
mouth she opens with doctrine.” The Hebrew word for “wisdom” is <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>חכמה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> (chokmâh) and means Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the
soul. This is the same as the word for knowledge in the New Testament which is <i>epignosis</i>
which means the full knowledge of Bible doctrine in the soul and is used in
Colossians 1:10. Even though she is a responder, Bible doctrine protects her
and she is not impressed with impressionable things such as celebrities or
history. To her, Bible doctrine is fantastic.</p>

<p class=Verses>“so that you will walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, to
please Him in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in
the knowledge of God;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Colossians 1:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The phrase “the teaching of kindness is on her tongue” in
Proverbs 31:26 uses the Hebrew word <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>תּורה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(tôrâh) for “teaching” which means
the law of doctrine communicated. The Hebrew word for “kindness” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>חֶסֶד</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(chesed)
and means literally “on her tongue, the law of grace.” The law of grace keeps
her from maligning, gossiping, or being vindictive.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The virtuous wife doesn’t malign others, or undermine
them, or express mental attitude sins about others, or judge them. She has
plenty of bona fide things to occupy her time. The worst troublemakers in any
local church are the frustrated females who spend their time tearing down
others.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Wife Knows the Needs, Joys, and Difficulties of
Her Household</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first Hebrew letter of Proverbs 31:27 is  <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>צ</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>  </span>or Tsadhe and represents a reaping hook.
This is the principle of the harvest of the virtuous wife’s soul. The phrase “She
looks well to the ways of her household” contains the qal active participle of
the Hebrew word <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>צפה</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>(tsâphâh) and means to be alert or to keep watch. She is alert to the
needs, the joys, and the difficulties of her household. The phrase “And does
not eat the bread of idleness” means her soul is not fat, slow, and repulsive.
She is animated because of her virtue love and esteem for her husband. </p>

<p class=Verses>“She looks well to the ways of her household, And does not eat
the bread of idleness.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 31:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Influence of the Mother Gives the Son an
Appreciation for Womanhood</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first Hebrew letter of Proverbs 31:28 is  <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>ק</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>  </span>or Qoph and represents the back of the
head or the subconscious and refers to flashbacks or retrospection. The
children may not be happy at the time, but they remember her.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Her children rise up and bless her; Her husband also, and he
praises her, saying:”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 31:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The phrase “Her children rise up” in Proverbs 31:28 means
when they grow up, their mature evaluation is that their mother is great! That
is why you have to leave your mother when you mature. The man always leaves his
mother and should never go back home to live. If a marriage doesn’t work out,
the daughter may go back to her mother, but never the son! It is the influence
of the mother that gives him an appreciation for womanhood.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The phrase “and bless her” is the piel imperfect of the
Hebrew word <span dir=RTL></span><span dir=RTL><span dir=RTL></span> </span><span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>אשׁר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span>(‘âshar) and means to be happy or to make happy. The literal
translation is, “Her sons grow up and recall her with happiness.” Here, the
mother teaches her son and the same is true for the father teaching his
daughter. The son will appreciate his mother and the daughters their father
because he protects the daughter.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew word for “husband” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>בּעל</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span>
(ba‛al) and means her lord. The phrase “he praises her” is the piel imperfect
of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>הָלַל</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (halal) and means that because a father
loves to have a great son, when he has this type of son, he turns around and
praises the mother intensively. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Husband Recognizes His Wife as Unique and
Exceptional</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first Hebrew letter of Proverbs 31:29 is  <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>ר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>  </span>or Resh and refers to the head or the
frontal lobe. Up to this point, we have been dealing with sons growing up. Now,
we come to daughters growing up. The phrase “Many daughters have done nobly” in
Proverbs 31:29 is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>עָשָׂה</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (asah) +  <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>חיל</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span>
(chayil) and means accomplished or done virtuously. The word <i>chayil</i> means
strength in a man, but it means ability, talent, integrity, virtue, and good
character in a woman. </p>

<p class=Verses>““Many daughters have done nobly, But you excel them all.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs
31:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The phrase “But you excel them all” is the qal perfect of
<span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>עלה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> (‛âlâh) for excel and means to surpass. This means that in a
world of many fantastic women of ability, beauty, character, spirituality, and
maturity, a husband should feel that his wife and only his wife surpasses all
others. The husband may have some admiration for other women, He may recognize
them as beautiful, talented, or full of integrity, or the opposite. However, the
husband with virtue love in his soul for his wife will view her as the only one
for him.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Husband Recognizes His Virtuous Wife by Her Soul
Beauty</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first Hebrew letter of Proverbs 31:30 is  <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>ש</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>  </span>or Shin means a tooth from the lower jaw
and refers to eating. This verse shows the result of a wife taking in Bible
doctrine every day. The result is occupation with Christ or maximum love toward
Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Charm is deceitful and beauty is vain, But a woman who fears
the LORD, she shall be praised.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 31:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew word for “charm” in Proverbs 31:30 is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>חן</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> (chên) and means elegant or glamorous beauty. Some women are
very beautiful, but you men should never identify your wife-to-be only on the
basis of her physical beauty. The phrase “charm is deceitful” means outward
beauty can be a lie. Let’s say you guys come to church and you try to find the
most beautiful woman there. Also, you ladies try the same thing by looking for
the most handsome guy. Once you get a good look at them, you should never
conclude in your soul that they must be the one for you. Beware of this
approach! Wait until they talk! This verse is saying that everything that is attractive
on the outside does not mean the soul will be just as attractive. You must use
the Bible doctrine in your soul to evaluate. This takes time. Take the time to
get to know what is in their soul. That is the real person. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some of you guys are looking for a Christian Miss America
and unfortunately, most are already married. This passage is difficult. There
are some very glamorous women in the world and many of them are already married,
but you are not to identify your potential wife on this basis! If she is
married, she is not for you, so hands off!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The phrase “beauty is vain” contains the Hebrew word <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>הבל</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> (hebel) and means useless or empty. A man may be attracted to
the glamorous and attractive outward beauty, but this is not the basis for
recognition of your wife to be. This disregards the soul. Recognition signals
are not related to the body, but to the soul. In 1 Corinthians 7:9, the burning
comes before the body. If it was the other way around, the honeymoon would come
before the marriage and that is not the way it should be! </p>

<p class=Verses>“But if they do not have self-control, let them marry; for it
is better to marry than to burn with passion.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 7:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Many women may be beautiful, but don’t identify your potential
wife on that basis. You must see something in her soul. Courtship involves
talking and thereby seeking to discover the content in her soul. What are you
ever going to discover in a woman’s soul if you are grabbing the body? There
will be plenty of time for that when you meet the woman for you and <u>after</u>
you get married. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Solomon fell into this trap. He was a body scanner. All
he did was chase beautiful women. He collected 1,000 of them, but not one of
them could he pour into his mold. Why? The woman is a gift to the man! When
Solomon met the Shulammite Woman, she was totally occupied with her Shepard Lover.
Solomon in all his glory couldn’t even get close to her. The Shepherd Lover was
in her soul while Solomon was trying to get to her body. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This does not imply that your potential wife will not
have a beautiful body. A beautiful body is not God’s way of identifying your potential
wife. Look into her soul. Is it filled with divine viewpoint based on Bible
doctrine? One day you will discover the most beautiful body in the world
because it was made just for you. You women are suckers to let every good
looking guy you like touch you and check you out. When the right man comes
along, he may want to reach over the table and touch you or reach under the
table and touch you, but somewhere you have got to talk! Identification takes
time and conversation. So control your hands when you go on that date. You are
to recognize her soul first, then you are to spend the rest of your married
life having glorious experiences. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The occupational hazard of being a beautiful woman is
pride, indolence, lust, bad temper and becoming spoiled. It takes a lot more
virtue in a man to recognize a glamorous, beautiful woman as the one for him if
she is arrogant and spoiled. Women who have been told by everyone how beautiful
they are can become filled with approbation lust and believe too much in their
beauty as being the most important thing in life. When you ladies look at
yourselves in the mirror and admire yourselves, you are emphasizing the wrong
thing! You are asking for trouble because you are emphasizing the wrong things!
You need a beautiful soul first! Some beautiful women never have identified the
right potential husband for them because they are stuck on themselves and their
beautiful body. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The phrase “But a woman who fears the Lord” in Proverbs
31:30 has no verb - only a noun. This sentence form in the Hebrew is stronger
than a verb and it means the woman occupied with the Lord shall be praised. The
phrase “She shall be praised” is a strong passive and means literally that
glamor is a lie, beauty is empty and useless. It also means that the woman
occupied with the Lord shall receive praise from the man she is dating or the
husband she has married. If she has her soul full of Bible doctrine, the woman
will be identified and she shall be praised. This is the soul rapport. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Virtuous Wife Desires Her Husband’s Touch</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first Hebrew letter of Proverbs 31:31 is  <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>ת</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>  </span>or Taw and refers to a sign or signature.
This is the wife in private with her husband. The phrase “Give her the product
of her hands” in Proverbs 31:31 is the woman in touching.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Give her the product of her hands, And let her works praise
her in the gates.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 31:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The word “give” in the Hebrew is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>נתן</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span>
(nâthan) and literally means for the husband to give unto his wife a loving
touch, which is the tactical response to her touching him. This husband’s touch
is in response to her loving touch. A wife will want to get her hands on her
husband. A woman who responds becomes aggressive with her hands and her lips.
The man has initiated so she wants to touch him all over. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is dedicated to the Christian women who have been
taught wrongly by some dear old Christian pastor that your wifely duty is to
live out your life never enjoying the loving touch that is so precious in
marriage. It is a soul response that drives the physical response! The soul
rapport is what you should seek with all of your soul. This is why the
spiritual life in marriage is such a wonderful thing - if it is based on the
virtue love of both.</p>
