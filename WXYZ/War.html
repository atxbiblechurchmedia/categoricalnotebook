<h2><a name="_War"></a>War </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are two types of war mentioned at some length in
the Bible – justified and unjustified. Justified war is the type of war which
defends true liberty, the rights and privileges of a nation’s citizens, which
protects its property, its women, and its children. A nation is justified in
defending itself in war from outside aggressors by maintaining a strong militia
and system of law enforcement.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Unjustified war is when an aggressive nation moves to
dominate other countries or to destroy them and reduce them to slavery. This
has been done numerous times in human history and continues today. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>War Will Always Exist In Human History </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>War will always exist in human history in spite of man’s
efforts for peace. War will always exist because there will be those who will
threaten the national security of a nation. Matt. 24:6-7; Eccl. 3:8; Mark 13:7;
Luke 21:9; Psalms 55:20-33; Psalms 68:30.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You will be hearing of wars and rumors of wars. See that
you are not frightened, for those things must take place, but that is not yet
the end. &quot;For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against
kingdom, and in various places there will be famines and earthquakes.” (Matthew
24:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“A time to love and a time to hate; A time for war and a time
for peace.” (Ecclesiastes 3:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be
frightened; those things must take place; but that is not yet the end.” (Mark
13:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;When you hear of wars and disturbances, do not be
terrified; for these things must take place first, but the end does not follow
immediately.&quot;” (Luke 21:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Rebuke the beasts in the reeds, The herd of bulls with the
calves of the peoples, Trampling under foot the pieces of silver; He has
scattered the peoples who delight in war.” (Psalms 68:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The exception is yet future in the Millennial reign of Jesus
Christ. War is a bona fide fact of history. Therefore, a nation must have the
military to protect the country from aggressive nations that threaten. Isaiah
2:4; Micah 4:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He will judge between the nations, And will render
decisions for many peoples; And they will hammer their swords into plowshares
and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not lift up sword against
nation, And never again will they learn war.” (Isaiah 2:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He will judge between many peoples And render decisions
for mighty, distant nations. Then they will hammer their swords into plowshares
And their spears into pruning hooks; Nation will not lift up sword against
nation, And never again will they train for war.” (Micah 4:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Justified Warfare is From God </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Chronicles 5:19-22, the Jews were fighting the
Arabs. How unusual! Note that because the war was of God, there was no such
thing as a conscientious objector in justified warfare. </p>

<p class=Verses>“They made war against the Hagrites, Jetur, Naphish and Nodab.
They were helped against them, and the Hagrites and all who were with them were
given into their hand; for they cried out to God in the battle, and He answered
their prayers because they trusted in Him. They took away their cattle: their
50,000 camels, 250,000 sheep, 2,000 donkeys; and 100,000 men. For many fell
slain, because the war was of God. And they settled in their place until the
exile.”  (1 Chronicles 5:19-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The objective of justified war is the annihilation of the
enemy and thus the enemy’s decisive defeat. This brings peace. Joshua 11:23;
Joshua 14:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD
had spoken to Moses, and Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel according
to their divisions by their tribes. Thus the land had rest from war.” (Joshua
11:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now the name of Hebron was formerly Kiriath-arba; for Arba was
the greatest man among the Anakim. Then the land had rest from war.” (Joshua
14:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Believer’s Place in the Nation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Church Age believer is an ambassador for the Lord
Jesus Christ on earth. The believer is to represent our Lord and to grow in
grace and knowledge of Him and to present the Gospel of salvation to a warring
world. Matt. 5:13-16</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt has
become tasteless, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for
anything, except to be thrown out and trampled under foot by men. &quot;You are
the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden; nor does anyone
light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on the lampstand, and it gives
light to all who are in the house. &quot;Let your light shine before men in
such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in
heaven.” (Matthew 5:13-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer is to respond to the authority of their pastor-teacher
in the local church. We are to daily learn and apply the categorical <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine that he serves up. Remember he is under the chain of command of
1 Corinthians 11:3 and other authority areas. No pastor-teacher can minister
without such authority. See category on <a href="#_D-Authority_Orientation">Authority
Orientation</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But I want you to understand that Christ is the head of every
man, and the man is the head of a woman, and God is the head of Christ.” (1
Corinthians 11:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As you function under the grace apparatus for perception,
remember that <i>gnosis</i> is factual spiritually understood doctrine in the
left lobe of the soul. It is not yet usable for the spiritual life. Only
believed <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the soul is
usable within the spiritual life and then only when filled with the Holy Spirit. 
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>War is For Adults</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Only adults are to participate in warfare. In the Old
Testament, the adults had to be age 20 or over. No one should go to war until they
are 20. They may train before that time, but front line duty is better left to
the well-trained and prepared. Num. 1:3; Num. 26:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“from twenty years old and upward, whoever is able to go out to
war in Israel, you and Aaron shall number them by their armies.” (Numbers 1:3,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Take a census of all the congregation of the sons of
Israel from twenty years old and upward, by their fathers' households, whoever
is able to go out to war in Israel.&quot;” (Numbers 26:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The exception is the newly married man. A newly married
man does not make a good soldier. Why? He cannot concentrate in battle because
he is afraid of being killed. A newly married man does not make a good business
man. Why? He has no sense of responsibility in business. His sole
responsibility for one year is to be with his wife. It means to make his wife
constantly happy for one year and thereby set the pace for the husband-wife
relationship for the rest of their lives. Deut. 24:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;When a man takes a new wife, he shall not go out with
the army nor be charged with any duty; he shall be free at home one year and
shall give happiness to his wife whom he has taken.” (Deuteronomy 24:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>However, war can be the basis for a soldier discovering
the right kind of woman for him. Deuteronomy 21:10-14 describes the preparation
process that they used in the Old Testament. There was a months-long cooling
off period. Her beautiful hair was shaved off, her nails were pared to the
quick, she removed her clothes and put on sack cloth and cries for a month for
her relatives lost in battle. If both survive the cooling off period, they could
marry. If not, the deal was off.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;When you go out to battle against your enemies, and the
LORD your God delivers them into your hands and you take them away captive, and
see among the captives a beautiful woman, and have a desire for her and would
take her as a wife for yourself, then you shall bring her home to your house,
and she shall shave her head and trim her nails. &quot;She shall also remove
the clothes of her captivity and shall remain in your house, and mourn her
father and mother a full month; and after that you may go in to her and be her
husband and she shall be your wife. &quot;It shall be, if you are not pleased
with her, then you shall let her go wherever she wishes; but you shall
certainly not sell her for money, you shall not mistreat her, because you have
humbled her.” (Deuteronomy 21:10-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Objective of Justified War</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The objective of justified war is the annihilation of the
enemy and thus their decisive defeat. This brings peace. Annihilation has to do
with the enemy personally - killing him. Decisive defeat has to do with
strategy, tactics, and logistics. In Joshua’s time, they had peace in the Land
because they slaughtered the enemy (Canaanites, as ordered by God) thus
decisively defeating them. Joshua 11:23; Joshua 14:15; Psalms 46:8-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD
had spoken to Moses, and Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel according
to their divisions by their tribes. Thus the land had rest from war.” (Joshua
11:23, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“Now the name of Hebron was formerly Kiriath-arba; for Arba was
the greatest man among the Anakim. Then the land had rest from war.” (Joshua
14:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Come, behold the works of the LORD, Who has wrought
desolations in the earth. He makes wars to cease to the end of the earth; He
breaks the bow and cuts the spear in two; He burns the chariots with fire.
“Cease striving and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I
will be exalted in the earth.” The LORD of hosts is with us; The God of Jacob
is our stronghold. Selah.”  (Psalms 46:8-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“He (God) breaks the bow and cuts the spear in two” and “He
burns the chariots with fire” are idioms which speak of the annihilation of the
enemy - the enemy being ripe for judgment by God. This results in peace. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Psalms 46:10 refers historically to the Lord sending His
angel into Sennacherib’s Assyrian camp outside Jerusalem to destroy all of the
185,000 first line soldiers arrayed against Jerusalem and Hezekiah. 2 Kings
19:35; 2 Chron. 32:21-22. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then it happened that night that the angel of the LORD went
out and struck 185,000 in the camp of the Assyrians; and when men rose early in
the morning, behold, all of them were dead.” (2 Kings 19:35, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the LORD sent an angel who destroyed every mighty warrior,
commander and officer in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned in
shame to his own land. And when he had entered the temple of his god, some of
his own children killed him there with the sword. So the LORD saved Hezekiah
and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of
Assyria and from the hand of all others, and guided them on every side.” (2
Chronicles 32:21-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>War Demand Military Leadership</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Warfare demands a high caliber of military leadership in
noncommissioned and commissioned officers. It is important that military
leaders have divine viewpoint minus mental attitude sins. Prov. 24:1-10. See category
on <a href="#_Leadership">Leadership</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do not be envious of evil men, Nor desire to be with them; For
their minds devise violence, And their lips talk of trouble.” (Proverbs 24:1-2,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“A wise man is strong, And a man of knowledge increases power.
For by wise guidance you will wage war, And in abundance of counselors there is
victory.” (Proverbs 24:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Consequences of Avoiding War</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There comes a time when it is sinful not to go to war.
Christian men should soon learn that they have a military obligation. This
preparation begins with a mental attitude based on Bible doctrine in the soul.
Num. 32:5-8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“They said, &quot;If we have found favor in your sight, let
this land be given to your servants as a possession; do not take us across the
Jordan.&quot; But Moses said to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Reuben,
&quot;Shall your brothers go to war while you yourselves sit here? &quot;Now
why are you discouraging the sons of Israel from crossing over into the land
which the LORD has given them? &quot;This is what your fathers did when I sent
them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land.” (Numbers 32:5-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Numbers 32:5, Gad and Reuben were cowboys and had
found this ranch land on the East side of Jordan, but the land west of Jordan
had not been conquered. In Numbers 32:6, Moses said it was unfair for ten
tribes to fight and you sit over there and ranch. In Numbers 32:7, their
refusal to participate in war would discourage the others from going to war. It
is amazing how those that claim they shouldn’t go to war even though their
country is at war will influence those who should know better. They were acting
just like those cowards of the first generation of Israel during the Exodus at Kadesh-Barnea.
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Numbers 32:14, it was time to go to war. It was sinful
not to go to war. Reuben and Gad were dragging their feet. In Numbers 32:17-19,
they changed their minds and agree to go to war.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Now behold, you have risen up in your fathers' place, a
brood of sinful men, to add still more to the burning anger of the LORD against
Israel.” (Numbers 32:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“but we ourselves will be armed ready to go before the sons of
Israel, until we have brought them to their place, while our little ones live
in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land. &quot;We will
not return to our homes until every one of the sons of Israel has possessed his
inheritance. &quot;For we will not have an inheritance with them on the other
side of the Jordan and beyond, because our inheritance has fallen to us on this
side of the Jordan toward the east.&quot;” (Numbers 32:17-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is biblical to fight for your country. You will not be
guilty if you fight. Num. 32:20-22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So Moses said to them, &quot;If you will do this, if you will
arm yourselves before the LORD for the war, and all of you armed men cross over
the Jordan before the LORD until He has driven His enemies out from before Him,
and the land is subdued before the LORD, then afterward you shall return and be
free of obligation toward the LORD and toward Israel, and this land shall be
yours for a possession before the LORD.” (Numbers 32:20-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Numbers 32:23 explains what would happen if they refused
to go to war. This is specifically for cowards who will not go to war.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But if you will not do so, behold, you have sinned
against the LORD, and be sure your sin will find you out.” (Numbers 32:23,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Numbers 32:31-32, they got the point. The battle was
on the west side of thee Jordan, not on the east, but by going to battle they were
fighting for their country. Do you get the point? </p>

<p class=Verses>“The sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben answered, saying,
&quot;As the LORD has said to your servants, so we will do. &quot;We ourselves
will cross over armed in the presence of the LORD into the land of Canaan, and
the possession of our inheritance shall remain with us across the
Jordan.&quot;” (Numbers 32:31-32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You don’t wait until the enemy invades your country. You
go out and hit them to preserve your nation. This means that a nation may be
fighting in faraway geographical areas to preserve the nation’s freedoms and
sovereignty. For example, the U.S. was justified to fight in Europe in World
War I and World War II. It was justified to fight the spread of Communism in
Vietnam. It is justified to fight the spread of radical Islam today. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Training for War</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Going to war requires training. You can’t just pick up a
weapon and get into a uniform. This includes building up arms and training
young men. You have to be trained. You don’t disarm for world peace any more
than you abolish your law enforcement agencies for a better community! In
Numbers 31:3-5, the phrase “Arm men from among you for the war” means to
prepare and use arms for warfare. “That they may go” means to let them which
are trained go to war. “Twelve thousand armed for war” means they started out
with a small, well-trained and prepared army. This is the way to start building
a powerful army. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Moses spoke to the people, saying, &quot;Arm men from among
you for the war, that they may go against Midian to execute the LORD'S
vengeance on Midian. &quot;A thousand from each tribe of all the tribes of
Israel you shall send to the war.&quot; So there were furnished from the
thousands of Israel, a thousand from each tribe, twelve thousand armed for
war.” (Numbers 31:3-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Judges 3:1-2, this context states that when Israel
came out of Egypt, they knew nothing about war. But God commanded that Israel
have a military organization in each generation for stability. Not only were
they to adhere to the Word of God, but part of that was armaments. This refers
to multiple generations of the children of Israel were to be taught war since
they had no such experience in while living in Egypt.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to test Israel
by them (that is, all who had not experienced any of the wars of Canaan; only
in order that the generations of the sons of Israel might be taught war, those
who had not experienced it formerly).”  (Judges 3:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Luke 14:31 means that if you are going to train men for
war, you need a department of defense. There must be professional war planning.
An army of 10,000 well-trained men can face 20,000 and win. It’s all about the
training and planning.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Or what king, when he sets out to meet another king in
battle, will not first sit down and consider whether he is strong enough with
ten thousand men to encounter the one coming against him with twenty
thousand?”  (Luke 14:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>War Requires Moral Courage </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Warfare demands a mental attitude of moral courage. In Deuteronomy
20:1, the Jewish army’s strength was always in their infantry footmen. Others
had a lot of horses. Regardless of what the enemy had, they were to never fear
them. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;When you go out to battle against your enemies and see
horses and chariots and people more numerous than you, do not be afraid of
them; for the LORD your God, who brought you up from the land of Egypt, is with
you.” (Deuteronomy 20:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The priests taught Bible doctrine to the soldiers. These were
the chaplains. The great key to military victory is spiritual victory. They
encouraged them with Bible doctrine. Deut. 20:2-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;When you are approaching the battle, the priest shall
come near and speak to the people. &quot;He shall say to them, 'Hear, O Israel,
you are approaching the battle against your enemies today. Do not be
fainthearted. Do not be afraid, or panic, or tremble before them, for the LORD
your God is the one who goes with you, to fight for you against your enemies,
to save you.'” (Deuteronomy 20:2-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The general officers clearly identified those soldiers
who should not fight and why. In Deuteronomy 20:5, those who had just built a
new house. The soldier who just called up just when he was about to move into
his house will have mental attitude sins and as such will have no moral or
battle courage. He will be unstable in battle. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;The officers also shall speak to the people, saying,
'Who is the man that has built a new house and has not dedicated it? Let him
depart and return to his house, otherwise he might die in the battle and
another man would dedicate it.” (Deuteronomy 20:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Deuteronomy 20:6, those who had just started a new
business. The double-minded man can’t concentrate and will be thinking about
his business. </p>

<p class=Verses>“'Who is the man that has planted a vineyard and has not begun
to use its fruit? Let him depart and return to his house, otherwise he might
die in the battle and another man would begin to use its fruit.” (Deuteronomy
20:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Deuteronomy 20:7, those who had just become engaged to
be married. This man will have nothing on his mind but that beautiful doll,
therefore he is unstable. Soldiers must be fearless. </p>

<p class=Verses>“'And who is the man that is engaged to a woman and has not
married her? Let him depart and return to his house, otherwise he might die in
the battle and another man would marry her.'” (Deuteronomy 20:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Deuteronomy 20:8, those who were cowards. After every
man had been trained, they determine what they were to do. Just before they went
into battle, they must make a decision with regard to their mental attitude.
Cowards have a wrong influence. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Then the officers shall speak further to the people and
say, 'Who is the man that is afraid and fainthearted? Let him depart and return
to his house, so that he might not make his brothers' hearts melt like his
heart.'” (Deuteronomy 20:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>War Requires Battle Courage </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Under some circumstances in Old Testament times, only the
males were killed in war. Deut. 20:13-15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;When the LORD your God gives it into your hand, you
shall strike all the men in it with the edge of the sword. &quot;Only the women
and the children and the animals and all that is in the city, all its spoil,
you shall take as booty for yourself; and you shall use the spoil of your
enemies which the LORD your God has given you. &quot;Thus you shall do to all
the cities that are very far from you, which are not of the cities of these
nations nearby.” (Deuteronomy 20:13-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Under other circumstances, every living thing was to be
destroyed. That means women, children, animals everything. Why? God's answer is
found in the last verse. Deut. 20:16-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Only in the cities of these peoples that the LORD your
God is giving you as an inheritance, you shall not leave alive anything that
breathes. &quot;But you shall utterly destroy them, the Hittite and the
Amorite, the Canaanite and the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite, as the
LORD your God has commanded you, so that they may not teach you to do according
to all their detestable things which they have done for their gods, so that you
would sin against the LORD your God.” (Deuteronomy 20:16-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Believer in War </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For the believer, Bible doctrine should be their prime
focus in life. Note the context and the emphasis on Bible doctrine. The temple
refers to the portrayal of Jesus Christ through Bible doctrine. Psalms 27:3-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Though a host encamp against me, My heart will not fear;
Though war arise against me, In spite of this I shall be confident. One thing I
have asked from the LORD, that I shall seek: That I may dwell in the house of
the LORD all the days of my life, To behold the beauty of the LORD And to
meditate in His temple.” (Psalms 27:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God prepares believers for training. 2 Sam. 22:35; Psalms
18:34; Psalms 144:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>““He trains my hands for battle, So that my arms can bend a bow
of bronze.”  (2 Samuel 22:35, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He trains my hands for battle, So that my arms can bend a bow
of bronze.”  (Psalms 18:34, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“A Psalm of David. Blessed be the LORD, my rock, Who trains my
hands for war, And my fingers for battle;”  (Psalms 144:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Note here how God enters into these verses. “Bend a bow
of bronze” is speaking of decisive defeat and annihilation of the enemy. These
two verses are dedicated to conscientious objectors who enjoy the freedom of a
land where men have died to keep it free. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers are protected by God in economic depression,
famine and war. Of course if it is God’s will for a believer to die in battle,
it is a privilege. If it is God’s will that the person is to live through the
darkest battle, he will! Job 5:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>““In famine He will redeem you from death, And in war from the
power of the sword.”  (Job 5:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If God can organize a snowflake, a snowstorm, a
hailstorm, then He can protect you against the day of battle and war. Job
38:21-23.</p>

<p class=Verses>““You know, for you were born then, And the number of your days
is great! “Have you entered the storehouses of the snow, Or have you seen the
storehouses of the hail, Which I have reserved for the time of distress, For
the day of war and battle?”  (Job 38:21-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Nations Who Plot For War</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are always those who plot war wrongfully. There are
always nations who are plotting the destruction of a nation to get its spoils
regardless of the peace program that is going on at the same time. There are
always traitors that emerge in times of conflict. Psalms 55:20-23 is a
description of a traitor. They are a very sorry type of character. The woods
are full of this type today. Psalms 68:30; Psalms 120:6-7; Psalms 140:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He has put forth his hands against those who were at peace
with him; He has violated his covenant. His speech was smoother than butter,
But his heart was war; His words were softer than oil, Yet they were drawn
swords. Cast your burden upon the LORD and He will sustain you; He will never
allow the righteous to be shaken. But You, O God, will bring them down to the
pit of destruction; Men of bloodshed and deceit will not live out half their
days. But I will trust in You.”  (Psalms 55:20-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Rebuke the beasts in the reeds, The herd of bulls with the
calves of the peoples, Trampling under foot the pieces of silver; He has
scattered the peoples who delight in war.” (Psalms 68:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Too long has my soul had its dwelling With those who hate
peace. I am for peace, but when I speak, They are for war.” (Psalms 120:6-7,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the choir director. A Psalm of David. Rescue me, O LORD,
from evil men; Preserve me from violent men Who devise evil things in their
hearts; They continually stir up wars.” (Psalms 140:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Peace Propaganda is a Weapon of War</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Peace propaganda is used as a weapon of warfare. In Micah
3:5, “the prophets who lead my people astray” are false prophets who were like
the liberal, unsaved clergyman we see today. The false teachers make them
wander without leadership, without Bible doctrine. “When they have something to
bite with their teeth” means to be childish or unrealistic with a lack of
common sense. Common sense today tells us that there are monsters who are
wanting to destroy us. They cry for peace just as the foreign tyrants cry peace
while they prepare for unjust warfare. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Thus says the LORD concerning the prophets who lead my people
astray; When they have something to bite with their teeth, They cry,
&quot;Peace,&quot; But against him who puts nothing in their mouths They
declare holy war.” (Micah 3:5, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Micah 3:6, “it will be night for you - without vision”
refers to a nation that listens to a bunch of liberal theologians and are blind
to the Gospel, blind to the danger of war. Liberalism means lack of preparation
for war or even defense should outside aggressors bring war. Blinded by peace
propaganda, the blind lead the blind. 2 Cor. 4:3-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore it will be night for you—without vision, And
darkness for you—without divination. The sun will go down on the prophets, And
the day will become dark over them.” (Micah 3:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who
are perishing, in whose case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the
unbelieving so that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory of
Christ, who is the image of God.” (2 Corinthians 4:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>These blind leaders will reach the end of themselves.
They have no answers, none at all! The greatest come-ons and invitations to the
peace-at-any-cost advocates are the peace platitudes coming from many of the
pulpits of America. These pulpits advocate disarmament, world peace movements,
and other programs for peace. This peace movement is apart from the Word of
God. And all the time, our enemies continue their planning to destroy us. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>War as Divine Discipline to a Nation </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>War is brought by God as a national divine discipline. In
Judges 5:8, the Jews went apostate and chose new gods. Divine discipline
brought war to the gates. They were caught completely unprepared. They had
disarmed their population.  </p>

<p class=Verses>““New gods were chosen; Then war was in the gates. Not a shield
or a spear was seen Among forty thousand in Israel.”  (Judges 5:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Chronicles 16:9, the Lord was on continuous patrol.
They didn’t get the Word and apply it, therefore war was brought on by God for national
disciplinary purposes. </p>

<p class=Verses>““For the eyes of the LORD move to and fro throughout the earth
that He may strongly support those whose heart is completely His. You have
acted foolishly in this. Indeed, from now on you will surely have wars.”“  (2
Chronicles 16:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Isaiah 3:16-26 illustrates what apostacy does to women.
This is what apostacy does to men - national discipline.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Moreover, the LORD said, “Because the daughters of Zion are
proud And walk with heads held high and seductive eyes, And go along with
mincing steps And tinkle the bangles on their feet, Therefore the Lord will
afflict the scalp of the daughters of Zion with scabs, And the LORD will make
their foreheads bare.” In that day the Lord will take away the beauty of their
anklets, headbands, crescent ornaments, dangling earrings, bracelets, veils,
headdresses, ankle chains, sashes, perfume boxes, amulets, finger rings, nose
rings, festal robes, outer tunics, cloaks, money purses, hand mirrors,
undergarments, turbans and veils. Now it will come about that instead of sweet
perfume there will be putrefaction; Instead of a belt, a rope; Instead of
well-set hair, a plucked-out scalp; Instead of fine clothes, a donning of
sackcloth; And branding instead of beauty. Your men will fall by the sword And
your mighty ones in battle. And her gates will lament and mourn, And deserted
she will sit on the ground.”  (Isaiah 3:16-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jeremiah 4:19 is a tame passage when compared to Jeremiah
6. In the Hebrew, it is much worse, as is Ezekiel 16, and Ezekiel 23. </p>

<p class=Verses>“My soul, my soul! I am in anguish! Oh, my heart! My heart is
pounding in me; I cannot be silent, Because you have heard, O my soul, The
sound of the trumpet, The alarm of war.”  (Jeremiah 4:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This anguish is the very worst type of pain. This
describes mental anguish because they know the enemy is coming. Jeremiah 4:20
describes their defeat.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Disaster on disaster is proclaimed, For the whole land is
devastated; Suddenly my tents are devastated, My curtains in an instant.” 
(Jeremiah 4:20, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jeremiah 4:22 describes God’s thinking toward these
childish and stupid people. They are this way because they have no Bible
doctrine. They are shrewd in their evil and produce evil and human good. It is
impossible for them to do any divine good. </p>

<p class=Verses>““For My people are foolish, They know Me not; They are stupid
children And have no understanding. They are shrewd to do evil, But to do good
they do not know.”“  (Jeremiah 4:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jeremiah 4:23-27 describes what the fifth cycle of
discipline looks like. </p>

<p class=Verses>“I looked on the earth, and behold, it was formless and void;
And to the heavens, and they had no light. I looked on the mountains, and
behold, they were quaking, And all the hills moved to and fro. I looked, and
behold, there was no man, And all the birds of the heavens had fled. I looked,
and behold, the fruitful land was a wilderness, And all its cities were pulled
down Before the LORD, before His fierce anger. For thus says the LORD, “The
whole land shall be a desolation, Yet I will not execute a complete
destruction.”  (Jeremiah 4:23-27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jeremiah 4:30 shows a picture of a woman helpless when an
invading army comes in. They will have no protection. They will be raped and
killed.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“And you, O desolate one, what will you do? Although you dress
in scarlet, Although you decorate yourself with ornaments of gold, Although you
enlarge your eyes with paint, In vain you make yourself beautiful. Your lovers
despise you; They seek your life.”  (Jeremiah 4:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Jeremiah 4:31, this is the scream of a woman being
raped. That’s what happens to the woman when you have a nation of people that
are “are shrewd to do evil, but to do good they do not know.” They have nothing
for God. They have no divine viewpoint because they have turned away from God
and His Word, Bible doctrine. Jer. 4:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For I heard a cry as of a woman in labor, The anguish as of
one giving birth to her first child, The cry of the daughter of Zion gasping
for breath, Stretching out her hands, saying, “Ah, woe is me, for I faint
before murderers.”“  (Jeremiah 4:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For My people are foolish, They know Me not; They are
stupid children And have no understanding. They are shrewd to do evil, But to
do good they do not know.&quot;” (Jeremiah 4:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>War as Personal Divine Discipline </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mental attitude sins are disciplined in war. Job 10:1
describes a believer with soul-fainting. These changes in history come through
mental attitude sins and through apostacy. Job 10:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>““I loathe my own life; I will give full vent to my complaint;
I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.”  (Job 10:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“‘You renew Your witnesses against me And increase Your anger
toward me; Hardship after hardship is with me.”  (Job 10:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Misnomers of War</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 26:52, Jesus Christ was telling Peter put away
his sword. This verse is often used by pacifist clergymen to turn young
Christian men into cowards. This is a reference to crime and to murder. It is a
capital punishment verse. Peter was not a soldier, therefore he had no business
with a sword. In other words, if you murder someone (as Peter was trying to
do), then capital punishment demands your life. This is not a military verse. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Jesus said to him, “Put your sword back into its place;
for all those who take up the sword shall perish by the sword.”  (Matthew
26:52, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>No person has the right to be a conscientious objector on
moral grounds or religious grounds. The U.S. Supreme Court has pronounced a
policy that, if a person for moral reasons was against war, he could be
excluded from military service. This is contrary to the Word of God and to the
Constitution of the U.S. and is catering to cowards. This is another step
toward the destruction of our country. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You may hear someone who has no Bible doctrine and is
ignorant of the Word of God say, “The God of the Old Testament was a God of
war, but the God of the New Testament is the God of peace.” We must love one
another and be peaceful. Or someone may say, “A lot of those verses on the
doctrine of war were taken out of the Old Testament, I’m living in the New
Testament.” Here are some verses to counter their statements. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>2 Timothy 3:16 refers to the Old Testament as well as the
New Testament. The war passages in the Old Testament are just as Scriptural as
John 3:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching,
for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness;”  (2 Timothy 3:16,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten
Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.” 
(John 3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Matthew 4:4 includes the whole counsel of God’s Word and
that includes the Old Testament. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But He answered and said, “It is written, ‘MAN SHALL NOT LIVE
ON BREAD ALONE, BUT ON EVERY WORD THAT PROCEEDS OUT OF THE MOUTH OF GOD.’”“ 
(Matthew 4:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 Corinthians 10:6 and 1 Corinthians 10:11 relate Old
Testament passages to the New Testament. The passages in the Old Testament on
war are just as true, just as binding, as any New Testament passage.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now these things happened as examples for us, so that we would
not crave evil things as they also craved.”  (1 Corinthians 10:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now these things happened to them as an example, and they were
written for our instruction, upon whom the ends of the ages have come.”  (1
Corinthians 10:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Military Responsibility</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For believers in the Lord Jesus Christ that are in
military service, the question of a conflict’s moral or immoral basis is not
the soldier’s problem. A nation’s military is to defend, to protect, and to
fight for our country abroad as well as at home when so ordered. The only
immorality involved in war is failure to end them in the most expeditious manner
possible. Those who say they will not fight because a certain conflict is
immoral are simply cowards at heart and have no sense of responsibility or
appreciation for their country. See category on <a href="#_Military_Service">Military
Service</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Authority Orientation in the Military</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When in the military, you recognize the authority of
those in your organization. You recognize the authority of those who have rank
over you. These are divinely-delegated authorities as part of the Laws of
Divine Establishment. These are set up in order to perpetuate the human race
and in order to make it possible for the Gospel of Jesus Christ to be preached
and proclaimed. Therefore, the believer is to recognize systems and people in
authority over you whenever and wherever they are encountered. See category on <a
href="#_D-Authority_Orientation">Authority Orientation</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Rationales for War</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is a lot of emotional shouting and yelling about
war, but very little clear and objective thinking. Wherever you are, there is a
sharp division of thought concerning the rationales for past wars or even war
in general.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Isaiah 2:4 and Micah 4:3 apply to the Millennium
dispensation, not the Church Age. We are not living in the Millennium. This is
yet future. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And He will judge between the nations, And will render
decisions for many peoples; And they will hammer their swords into plowshares
and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not lift up sword against
nation, And never again will they learn war.” (Isaiah 2:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He will judge between many peoples And render decisions
for mighty, distant nations. Then they will hammer their swords into plowshares
And their spears into pruning hooks; Nation will not lift up sword against
nation, And never again will they train for war.” (Micah 4:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Joel 3:9-10 applies to the Tribulation. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Proclaim this among the nations: Prepare a war; rouse the
mighty men! Let all the soldiers draw near, let them come up! Beat your
plowshares into swords And your pruning hooks into spears; Let the weak say,
&quot;I am a mighty man.&quot;” (Joel 3:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 10:34-36, Jesus Christ is speaking during His
First Advent. Our Lord is referring to the Gospel for salvation where
acceptance or rejection of Jesus Christ’s work on the Cross being a divider of
families and peoples.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Do not think that I came to bring peace on the earth; I
did not come to bring peace, but a sword. &quot;For I came to SET A MAN AGAINST
HIS FATHER, AND A DAUGHTER AGAINST HER MOTHER, AND A DAUGHTER-IN-LAW AGAINST
HER MOTHER-IN-LAW; and A MAN'S ENEMIES WILL BE THE MEMBERS OF HIS HOUSEHOLD.”
(Matthew 10:34-36, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Matthew 24:6-7 applies to the Church Age and the
Tribulation will be characterized by wars and rumors of wars!</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You will be hearing of wars and rumors of wars. See that
you are not frightened, for those things must take place, but that is not yet
the end. &quot;For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against
kingdom, and in various places there will be famines and earthquakes.” (Matthew
24:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What have we learned from history?  Any nation which
disarms because of emphasis on peace programs, brotherhood, good neighbor
policies becomes a sitting duck and suffers horribly.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Because of the old sin nature, the human race will always
need, except in the Millennium, a strong police and court system to protect and
not exploit the rights of the people, plus a national guard that can be called
out in emergencies. They will need a strong, disciplined, orderly military for
protection from outside aggression.</p>
