<h2>The Doctrinal Woman </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Gracious Woman</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 11:16, the Hebrew word for “gracious” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>חן</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(chên) and means one with grace, elegance
of form and appearance. God does not intend for women to be disheveled and
thrown together in their looks. A gracious woman is compared to a strong man.
Beauty in form and appearance is the counterpart to the strength of a man. A
gracious woman is able to retain her honor. It is not damaged by her poise and
behavior.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;A gracious woman attains honor, And ruthless men attain
riches.&quot;  (Proverbs 11:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hebrew word for “honor” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>כָּבוֹד</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(kabod) and means splendor and glory of
the external. This is the woman in her beauty being the full expression of the
glory of man. Her own personal beauty does not detract from the Bible doctrine
in her soul reflecting the thinking and glory of her Savior, Jesus Christ. Her
outer beauty does not hide the inner response to her husband.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Beautiful Woman</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 29:17 and Proverbs 11:22, the Hebrew word for
“beautiful” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>יפה</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(yâpheh) and means
fair, comely, beautiful. This is a beautiful woman. Beauty is an attribute of
the woman, not an accessory. Of course, the quantity or quality varies with all
women. Beauty is something that doesn’t just happen. There are ways in which
the beauty will be shown. Just as God has characteristics in His essence,
various things are needful to bring them out.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And Leah's eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful of
form and face.&quot;  (Genesis 29:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; As a ring of gold in a swine's snout So is a beautiful
woman who lacks discretion.&quot;  (Proverbs 11:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s essence is expressed through written revelation.
God’s essence is expressed through the functioning spiritual gifts of
believers. God’s essence is expressed in the creation and beauty of the earth.
He spent six days restoring it to be a wonderful place for man to live. God has
designed beauty to be enjoyed, not concealed, laughed at, made the object of
jealousy or some prudish remark. This is a principle throughout the entirety of
Scripture.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Beauty as an attribute must be coupled with other
attributes. Just as God’s entire character must be coordinated, even so the
entirety of the woman must be coordinated. Beauty must be teamed up with
discretion, or else the beauty is flaunted in the mud. “Discretion” in Proverbs
11:22 in the Hebrew is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>טעם</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(ṭa‛am) and means
judgment, discernment. Good judgment and beauty coalesce.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Virtuous Woman</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 12:4 and Proverbs 31:10, the Hebrew word for
“excellent” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>חיל</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(chayil) and means
virtuous, excellent, one who has ability, efficiency and moral worth. The
virtuous woman is a “crown” of her husband. This is the figurative use of the
word and means honor or glory. The virtuous woman in her ability and efficiency
is an honor to her husband. She is very valuable and truly rare. She is hard to
find. Apparently the characteristics of virtue (ability and efficiency) are
rare.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;An excellent wife, who can find? For her worth is far
above jewels.&quot;  (Proverbs 31:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;An excellent wife is the crown of her husband, But she
who shames him is like rottenness in his bones.&quot;  (Proverbs 12:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The virtuous woman’s husband has confidence in her
economic ability. Her expression of ability and efficiency goes a long way to
enhance and supplement that of her husband. She is not afraid of hard work and
is creative. She will go to great lengths to make provision for her family. She
has a capacity to see and fill the needs of others. She is careful in planning
when it comes to purchases and does not do a lot of sporadic and spontaneous
buying.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The virtuous woman keeps herself in good physical condition.
In Proverbs 31:17, “gird” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>חגר</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(châgar) and means
to make ready for grace orientation. “Strength” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>עז</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(‛ôz) and is material and physical strength.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;She girds herself with strength And makes her arms
strong.&quot;  (Proverbs 31:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The virtuous woman senses that her trade is profitable.
She has appreciation for her accomplishments. In Proverbs 31:18, the Hebrew
word for “senses” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>טעם</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(ṭâ‛am) and means
to perceive or sense. “Lamp” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>ניר</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(nı̂yr) and is used
to mean household work.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;She senses that her gain is good; Her lamp does not go
out at night.&quot;  (Proverbs 31:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The virtuous woman is ambitious and uses her extra time
to enhance herself and others. Prov. 31:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;She stretches out her hands to the distaff, And her hands
grasp the spindle.&quot;  (Proverbs 31:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The virtuous woman is creative in the preparation of her
and her husband’s bed and in the preparation of her clothing. In Proverbs
31:22, the Hebrew word for “clothing” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>לבוּשׁ</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(lebûsh) and refers to her attire of fine
linen used for a garment. The virtuous woman’s clothing has real class and real
taste. The word “coverings” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>מרבד</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(marbad) and refers
to the covers and preparation of her and her husband’s bed. These are the best,
the latest thing.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;She makes coverings for herself; Her clothing is fine
linen and purple.&quot;  (Proverbs 31:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The virtuous woman is a strong and capable woman. In Proverbs
31:25, “strength” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>עז</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(‛ôz) and refers to
physical strength. “Dignity” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>הדר</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(hâdâr) and means
honor, dignity, splendor.  She is a good, capable woman. “Clothing” is
figuratively used.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Strength and dignity are her clothing, And she smiles at
the future.&quot;  (Proverbs 31:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The virtuous woman has proper content and expression in
her speech. In Proverbs 31:26, the Hebrew word for “wisdom” is <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>חכמה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(chokmâh) and means wit, wisdom,
skillful. “Kindness” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>חֶסֶד</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(chesed) and means
lovingkindness, devout, merciful. This is kindly ethical and religious
instruction.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;She opens her mouth in wisdom, And the teaching of
kindness is on her tongue.&quot;  (Proverbs 31:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The virtuous woman centers her attention on her
priorities. In Proverbs 31:27, the Hebrew word for “ways” is <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>הליכה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(hălı̂ykâh) and means procession or ways
and refers to her watchfulness of what is going on in her household.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;She looks well to the ways of her household, And does not
eat the bread of idleness.&quot;  (Proverbs 31:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The virtuous woman’s happiness is evident to her husband
and children. In Proverbs 31:28, the Hebrew word for “bless” is <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>אשׁר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>('âshar) and means to pronounce happy. “Praises”
is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>הָלַל</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(halal) and means to
praise or boast. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Her children rise up and bless her; Her husband also, and
he praises her, saying: &quot;  (Proverbs 31:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The virtuous woman has the blessing of her family and
they enjoy her fulfilling this capacity. In Proverbs 31:29, the Hebrew word for
“excel” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>עלה</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(‛âlâh) and means
excellence. See category in <a href="#_The_Virtuous_Wife_1">The Virtuous Wife
and Mother</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Many daughters have done nobly, But you excel them
all.&quot;&quot;  (Proverbs 31:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Woman Who Fears The Lord</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 31:30, “Charm” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
