<h2>Worldliness</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Worldliness is a mental attitude or a way of thinking.
Overt acts may or may not result. Worldliness is thought content in the mind
and is anything that excludes divine viewpoint and fails to orient to life
based on Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Worldliness is not determined by where you go or what you
do, but by what goes on in your mind. Worldliness is any mental attitude which
is contrary to the Word or what you think when your soul is controlled by the
old sin nature (carnality). When a believer’s thinking is worldly, thoughts
good or bad are either from the area of strength of the old sin nature or the
area of weakness in the old sin nature. Worldliness is rejection of the need to
confess sins to God the Father and be restored to the filling of the Holy
Spirit. Worldliness is also thinking that you have to do something for
forgiveness. 1 John 1:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A statement of worldliness can be found in 1 John 2:15. “Love”
is a mental attitude - something you think, an absence of mental attitude sins.
In Romans 5:5, “hearts” refers to the right lobe of the soul.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do not love the world nor the things in the world. If anyone
loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.” (1 John 2:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been
poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.”
(Romans 5:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To love the world is called “worldliness” where you have
a mental attitude of human viewpoint in your mind. The believer is commanded to
not be conformed to the world’s way of thinking, but to be renewed from the
inside out by the accumulation of <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the right
lobe of the soul. Rom. 12:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by
the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that
which is good and acceptable and perfect.” (Romans 12:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are two mutually exclusive viewpoints described in
the Word of God - divine viewpoint and human viewpoint. The love of the Father
and the love of the world cannot coexist in your mind. They are mutually
exclusive. One drives out the other. Isaiah 55:8-9. See category on <a
href="#_D-Divine_Viewpoint_vs.">Divine Viewpoint vs. Human Viewpoint</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For My thoughts are not your thoughts, Nor are your ways
My ways,&quot; declares the LORD. &quot;For as the heavens are higher than the
earth, So are My ways higher than your ways And My thoughts than your
thoughts.” (Isaiah 55:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>After salvation the first thing that must be straightened
out is not what you do, but what you think! You are what you think! Prov. 23:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For as he thinks within himself, so he is. He says to you,
&quot;Eat and drink!&quot; But his heart is not with you.” (Proverbs 23:7,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Three factors are necessary to eliminate worldliness -
the filling of the Holy Spirit, daily intake of Bible doctrine via the grace
apparatus for perception, and avoiding emotional revolt of the soul. When you
are controlled by the Holy Spirit, with the Holy Spirit teaching the human
spirit the Word, this causes the right lobe of the soul to be full of <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine, which is the opposite of worldliness.</p>
