<h2>Holy Spirit, Five Sins Against</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Two of the five sins against the Holy Spirit are from unbelievers
- resistance of the Holy Spirit and blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. The
other three sins against the Holy Spirit are from believers only - lying to the
Holy Spirit, grieving the Holy Spirit, and quenching the Holy Spirit. All are a
result of being controlled by the old sin nature.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Resistance of the Holy Spirit </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Resistance of the Holy Spirit is rejection of the Lord
Jesus Christ in the Church Age. The Pre-salvation ministry of the Holy Spirit
is a convicting ministry of the sin of unbelief, the absolute righteousness (+R)
of God, the relative righteousness (-R) of man, and judgment from rejecting
Jesus Christ as Savior by resisting the convicting ministry of the Holy Spirit.
Acts 7:51; John 16:7-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You men who are stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart
and ears are always resisting the Holy Spirit; you are doing just as your
fathers did.” (Acts 7:51, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But I tell you the truth, it is to your advantage that I
go away; for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but if I go,
I will send Him to you. &quot;And He, when He comes, will convict the world
concerning sin and righteousness and judgment; concerning sin, because they do
not believe in Me; and concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father and
you no longer see Me; and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world
has been judged.” (John 16:7-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit was rejection of Jesus
Christ while He was ministering on the earth in the previous dispensation - the
Jewish Age. Jesus Christ was filled with the Holy Spirit during His earthly
ministry and to reject Him was blasphemy against the Holy Spirit - the
unpardonable sin. Matt. 12:31-32. See category on <a
href="#_The_Unpardonable_Sin">The Unpardonable Sin</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Therefore I say to you, any sin and blasphemy shall be
forgiven people, but blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven.
&quot;Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him;
but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him,
either in this age or in the age to come.” (Matthew 12:31-32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The following three sins against the Holy Spirit are from
believers only - lying to the Holy Spirit, grieving the Holy Spirit, and
quenching the Holy Spirit. All are a result of being controlled by the old sin
nature.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Lying to the Holy Spirit</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Lying to the Holy Spirit is sin resulting from false
motivation plus approbation lust. Two examples are Ananias and Sapphira. Acts
5:3-11. See category on <a href="#_Ananias_and_Sapphira">Ananias and Sapphira</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But Peter said, &quot;Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart
to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back some of the price of the land?
&quot;While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own? And after it was
sold, was it not under your control? Why is it that you have conceived this
deed in your heart? You have not lied to men but to God.&quot;” (Acts 5:3-4,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now there elapsed an interval of about three hours, and his
wife came in, not knowing what had happened. And Peter responded to her,
&quot;Tell me whether you sold the land for such and such a price?&quot; And
she said, &quot;Yes, that was the price.&quot; Then Peter said to her,
&quot;Why is it that you have agreed together to put the Spirit of the Lord to
the test? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the
door, and they will carry you out as well.&quot;” (Acts 5:7-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Grieving the Holy Spirit</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Grieving the Holy Spirit is producing sins from the area
of weakness in your old sin nature. These are moral versus immorality issues,
sins of the tongue, and mental attitude sins. This is any sin in the life of
the believer which involves a moral or ethical issue. Eph. 4:30. See category
on <a href="#_Grieving_the_Holy">Grieving the Holy Spirit</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed
for the day of redemption.” (Ephesians 4:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Quenching the Holy Spirit</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Quenching the Holy Spirit is producing human good from
the area of strength of the old sin nature such as witnessing, giving money,
etc., to gain approbation. Human good soothes the conscience and keeps the
believer from confessing their known sins to God the Father and thereby
regaining the filling of the Holy Spirit. The application is to do it as unto
the Lord or don’t do it! This is disobedience to God’s Word that doesn’t
involve an ethical or moral issue. 1 Thess. 5:19; 1 John 1:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do not quench the Spirit;” (1 Thessalonians 5:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>
