<h2><a name="_Human_Viewpoint"></a>The Human Spirit</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The human spirit is the immaterial part of every believer
that was imputed by God at salvation to enable the believer to understand the
teaching of spiritual information. The Holy Spirit teaches the human spirit the
communicated spiritual information only when the believer is filled with the
Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit then converts that understood spiritual
information into spiritual knowledge (<i>gnosis</i>) and transfers it to the
left lobe of the soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The human spirit must be distinguished from the human
soul. Heb. 4:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any
two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of
both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the
heart.” (Hebrews 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the original creation of man, the human spirit was
received along with the human soul when God the Father breathed into Adam the
“breath of lives.” Gen. 2:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD God formed man of dust from the ground, and
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being.”
(Genesis 2:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When Adam and the woman ate of the fruit and sinned, both
lost their human spirit and became dichotomous, with a physical body and soul
only. They also both acquired an old sin nature. At the point of sin, they
became spiritually dead. From that point on, every member of the human race has
been born with a genetically-formed sin nature and without a human spirit. At
the point of physical birth, everyone receives the imputation of Adam’s
original sin. All are born spiritually dead except the unique God-man Jesus
Christ because of His virgin birth. Rom. 5:12.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world,
and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned—”
(Romans 5:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The unbeliever does not have a human spirit. As a
dichotomous being, body and soul, the unbeliever cannot understand spiritual
information because they have no human spirit. To them, spiritual information
or Bible doctrine is foolishness. 1 Cor. 2:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of
God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because
they are spiritually appraised.” (1 Corinthians 2:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer is trichotomous with a body, soul, and human
spirit. Why? Because the human spirit is acquired from God the Holy Spirit at
the moment of salvation along with the filling and indwelling of the Holy
Spirit. To this newly acquired human spirit, God the Father imputed His eternal
life to that human spirit. For the believer, human IQ is no longer a handicap
to learning Bible doctrine. Spiritual perception is the Holy Spirit teaching
the human spirit. Both the human spirit and the Holy Spirit are necessary for
the function of the grace apparatus for perception. Eph. 2:5; 1 Thess. 5:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive
together with Christ (by grace you have been saved),” (Ephesians 2:5, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you entirely; and
may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame at the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.” (1 Thessalonians 5:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the communication of the Gospel to the unbeliever, the
Holy Spirit acts as the human spirit for the perception of salvation
information. John 16:8-11; 1 Cor. 2:14-16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;And He, when He comes, will convict the world concerning
sin and righteousness and judgment; concerning sin, because they do not believe
in Me; and concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father and you no
longer see Me; and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has
been judged.” (John 16:8-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of
God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because
they are spiritually appraised. But he who is spiritual appraises all things,
yet he himself is appraised by no one. For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD,
THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.” (1 Corinthians
2:14-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The spiritual IQ of the believer or the believer’s
ability to comprehend Bible doctrine is related to the human spirit. Job 32:8;
Rom. 8:16; 1 Thess. 5:23; Philemon 1:25.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But it is a spirit in man, And the breath of the
Almighty gives them understanding.” (Job 32:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are
children of God,” (Romans 8:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you entirely; and
may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame at the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.” (1 Thessalonians 5:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.”
(Philemon 1:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer’s positive volition and filling of the
Spirit are both necessary to make doctrine taught from the Bible understandable
and to be transferred to the human spirit as spiritually understood
information. In 1 Corinthians 2:13, “spiritual thoughts with spiritual words”
is <span lang=EL>πνευματικο</span>́<span lang=EL>ς</span> (pneumatikos) in the
Greek. The Holy Spirit does everything here. John 14:26; 1 Cor. 2:9-16; 1 John
2:27.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will
send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance
all that I said to you.” (John 14:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the
Spirit who is from God, so that we may know the things freely given to us by
God, which things we also speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in
those taught by the Spirit, combining spiritual thoughts with spiritual words.”
(1 Corinthians 2:12-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“As for you, the anointing which you received from Him abides
in you, and you have no need for anyone to teach you; but as His anointing
teaches you about all things, and is true and is not a lie, and just as it has
taught you, you abide in Him.” (1 John 2:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Holy Spirit then automatically transfers the
spiritually understood doctrine (<i>pneumatikos</i>) to the left lobe of the
soul as <i>gnosis</i>. Here, it is ready for the believer to either accept it
with positive volition or to reject it with negative volition. Negative
volition results in <i>gnosis</i> staying where it is in the left lobe of the
soul. Here, it has no spiritual value or application. It must be believed to be
of any spiritual use. Upon the believer’s positive volition acceptance or
belief, again, the Holy Spirit does everything by converting the <i>gnosis</i>
to <i>epignosis</i> (full knowledge) and transferring it to the right lobe of
the soul. See category on the <a href="#_Grace_Apparatus_For">Grace Apparatus
for Perception</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The right lobe of the soul is the place for <i>epignosis</i>
storage and application to the spiritual life. <i>Epignosis</i> doctrine in the
right lobe of the soul becomes residual doctrine with which the edification
complex is constructed. Eph. 3:17-19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; and
that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all
the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the
love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled up to all the
fullness of God.” (Ephesians 3:17-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ephesians 3:17, “that Christ may dwell” refers to
Christ being at home in the body of every Church Age believer. “Being rooted”
is <span lang=EL>ρ</span>̔<span lang=EL>ιζο</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(rhizoō) in the Greek and means foundation of a root, the filling of the Holy
Spirit. “And grounded” is <span lang=EL>θεμελιο</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(themelioō) in the Greek and means to lay a foundation of <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the soul for establishing a frame of
reference and an edification complex. “In love” is God's perfect love, which is
only possible through the filling of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ephesians 3:18, “comprehend” is <span lang=EL>καταλαμβα</span>́<span
lang=EL>νω</span> (katalambanō) and means Bible doctrine seized which is <i>epignosis</i>
in the right lobe of the soul. This <i>epignosis</i> or full knowledge of the
Word has been believed by faith is stored in the areas in the right lobe of the
soul. There is room for every word that came out of the mouth of God to be
stored. Christ is at home in your heart when the believer is filled with the
Holy Spirit and developing an edification complex. Eph. 4:20-24.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But you did not learn Christ in this way, if indeed you have
heard Him and have been taught in Him, just as truth is in Jesus, that, in
reference to your former manner of life, you lay aside the old self, which is
being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit, and that you be renewed
in the spirit of your mind, and put on the new self, which in the likeness of
God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth.” (Ephesians
4:20-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer possesses the human spirit as the basis of
their spiritual IQ. Therefore, doctrine stored in the right lobe of the soul is
the area of refreshment. Basic doctrine builds up a frame of reference.
Advanced doctrine builds upon basic doctrine and results in the construction of
your edification complex. Eph. 3:16-19; 2 Cor. 7:13.  See category on the <a
href="#_D-The_Edification_Complex">The Edification Complex of the Soul</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason we have been comforted. And besides our
comfort, we rejoiced even much more for the joy of Titus, because his spirit
has been refreshed by you all.” (2 Corinthians 7:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Doctrine stored in the right lobe of the soul is the
basis of grace orientation. Philemon 1:25.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.”
(Philemon 1:25, NASB)</p>
