<h2>Hymns Used in Worship</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>“Art Thou Weary, Art Thou Languid”</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Background: Written by Stephen the Sabaite, a nephew to
John of Damascus. John had been tutored by a slave who had later been freed and
both retired in a monastery in the wilderness of Judea. Stephen was taken with
them to the monastery and after the death of his uncle and the slave, Stephen
wrote this hymn. It was later recreated by Dr. Neale in 1862 combining the
experience of Stephen and that of himself in the song. Considered a Greek hymn.
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Doctrine: Eternal rest given by Christ. Sufferings of
Christ portrayed. Kingship of Christ. Acceptance of Christ. Blessings of
Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Application: Comfort and fellowship because of the
undeserved suffering of Christ. It is a hymn of praise. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scriptural basis: Matt. 11:28; John 6:39; Mark 13:31.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Come to Me, all who are weary and heavy-laden, and
I will give you rest.&quot;  (Matthew 11:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;This is the will of Him who sent Me, that of all
that He has given Me I lose nothing, but raise it up on the last day.&quot; 
(John 6:39, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will
not pass away.&quot;  (Mark 13:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>“Beneath the Cross of Jesus” </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Background: This hymn was written by Elizabeth Clephane
near the end of her life in 1869. She was very fond of poetry and had a very
good imagination. Also, at the time of writing this hymn, she had a glimpse of
the future better land and footprints leading to that final goal. This was
apparently a dream under dying grace. It was this setting to which the hymn
finds its origin. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Doctrine: Christ the great Rock of salvation in a weary
land of sin. The sufferings of Christ for sins. Unworthiness of man. Blessings
received from the death of Christ. The eternal love and grace of God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scriptural basis: Matt. 27:36.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And sitting down, they began to keep watch over Him
there.&quot;  (Matthew 27:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>“Blest Be the Tie that Binds” </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Background: This hymn was written by John Fawcett and it
was born out of the incident involving a pastor of a Yorkshire village who was
planning to leave his small church and people to go to a much larger and
wealthier church in London. When everything was ready to go, he and his wife
found they could not bear to leave the people who were so close to them. So,
they stayed and Fawcett wrote this hymn in this setting. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Doctrine: Doctrine of Christian Love. Verse 1 - <i>agape</i>
and <i>phileo</i>. Verse 2 - prayer. Verse 3 - responsibilities within the Body
of Christ. Verse 4 - good-byes and hellos. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Musical: The rhythm is smoothly written to express the
harmonious flowing of unity and rapport love that occurs between the hearts of
Christians. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scriptural basis: 1 John 1:7; John 13:34-35.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;but if we walk in the Light as He Himself is in the
Light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son
cleanses us from all sin.&quot;  (1 John 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;A new commandment I give to you, that you love one
another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one another. &quot;By
this all men will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one
another.&quot;&quot;  (John 13:34-35, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>“Break Thou the Bread of Life” </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Background: This hymn was composed by Mary Lathbury when
attending Chautauqua summer school and religious resort in New York. She had
been asked to write two hymns for the school. This was one of the hymns that
she wrote. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Doctrine: Verse 1 - the Word of God as the spiritual
bread of life. Verse 2 - the Word of God as the absolute truth. Verse 3 - believers’
love for the Word, the believers’ need for spiritual gift instruction of the
text.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Application: Experience of peace occurs with the
partaking of the Truth. Reveals a thirst for greater truths and deep set
desires and emotions within the soul. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scriptural Basis: Matt. 14:19; John 8:32; John 6:35;
Matt. 5:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Ordering the people to sit down on the grass, He took the
five loaves and the two fish, and looking up toward heaven, He blessed the
food, and breaking the loaves He gave them to the disciples, and the disciples
gave them to the crowds,&quot;  (Matthew 14:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you
free.&quot;&quot;  (John 8:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Jesus said to them, &quot;I am the bread of life; he who
comes to Me will not hunger, and he who believes in Me will never
thirst.&quot;  (John 6:35, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for
righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.&quot;  (Matthew 5:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>“Breathe On Me, Breath of God” </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Background: This hymn was written by Edwin Hatch in 1886
who, in his strong faith and quiet and deep joy, wrote from his soul what he
felt that the disciples in the Upper Room must have felt when Jesus breathed on
them the Holy Spirit. He put himself in their place and wrote how it must have
seemed to them. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Doctrine: We do not have to ask for the Holy Spirit
because He is already given to us. Verse 1 - the song refers to the filling of
the Spirit, but from a standpoint void of the principle of confession of sin
using 1 John 1:9. Verse 2 - it confuses the cleansing of the Holy Spirit at
confession with the construction of the edification complex of the soul. Verse
3 - it confuses the issue of overt Christianity with the concept of outward fiery
manifestations which may or may not be the case. Verse 4 - it puts the sealing
ministry of the Holy Spirit as something that is yet future and, therefore,
lacks the emphasis of the assurance of the believer as the present possessor of
eternal life. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scriptural basis: Job 33:4; John 20:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;The Spirit of God has made me, And the breath of
the Almighty gives me life.&quot;  (Job 33:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And when He had said this, He breathed on them and *said
to them, &quot;Receive the Holy Spirit.&quot;  (John 20:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>“Christ the Lord is Risen Today” </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Background: This hymn was written by Charles Wesley out
of a sincere desire to elevate man’s thinking by the inspiration of poetry.
This poetry, being Christian in message, lifted minds not only through the
inspiration of poetry but also by that of the message it contained. This hymn
reveals victory and assurance contrasted to his somewhat somber background. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Doctrine: The fact of Christ’s resurrection calls for men
and angels to rejoice. The death of Christ on the Cross is evidence of love and
that He won the battle. His resurrection overcame death and He released the Old
Testament saints. The latter would be correct if understood that this is not a
resurrection of Old Testament saints since this occurs at the end of the
Tribulation and preceding the Millennium. Christ as the King, alive, died once
for salvation. Salvation is for all who believe. Wesley did not historically
believe in universal salvation. The responsibility to God’s plan on earth, the
death of the believer, the resurrection of the believer is all based on that
which Christ has done before and for us. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scriptural basis: 1 Cor. 15:55-57.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;O DEATH, WHERE IS YOUR VICTORY? O DEATH, WHERE IS
YOUR STING?&quot; The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law;
but thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus
Christ.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 15:55-57, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>“Christian, Dost Thou See Them” </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Background: This hymn was written by Andrew of Crete
after studying in detail Paul’s letter to Titus. He thusly named Titus as the
first bishop of Crete. He wrote this hymn as an expression in poetry form that
which characterized the life of believers. He brought into the hymn exhortation
to awareness of foes and awareness of victory through prayer and the cross. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Doctrine: Verse 1 - Satan and the powers of darkness, angelic
and demonic influence on believers. Verse 2 - temptation. Verse 3 - victory in
the Angelic Conflict. Verse 4 -  victory in eternity. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Devotional: This is a song of exhortation to believers
and also one which brings into it the motivation for obedience.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>“Come, Thou Almighty King” </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Background: This hymn is attributed to Charles Wesley but
the original author is not known. It was introduced in a Long Island church by
a group of American patriots when a band of British soldiers demanded the
congregation sing “God, Save the King.” Instead, the church sang “Come, Thou
Almighty King.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Doctrine: Verse 1 - incarnation of Christ. Verse 2 - the
Holy Spirit, the sovereignty of the Father. Verse 3 - the kingship of Christ. Verse
4 - the Trinity. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Application: This is a true devotional hymn, well
balanced to render worship, praise, and self-exhortation. It is a prayer of the
heart that the three persons of the Godhead may exercise control upon the one
who is singing that they may be able to praise God in fullness. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scriptural basis: Psalms 51:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;O Lord, open my lips, That my mouth may declare Your
praise.&quot;  (Psalms 51:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>“Crown Him with Many Crowns” </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Background: This was written by Matthew Bridges after he
and a group of others left the Church of England and joined Roman Catholicism.
This was one of the poems in a volume called The Passions of Jesus. The
original title was The Song of the Seraphs. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Doctrine: Verse 1 - the crowning of Jesus Christ,
victorious and ruling, Jesus Christ as the Lamb of God, the sacrificial
offering, rejoining of the angels, the Angelic Conflict related to the
character of God, the Kingship of Jesus Christ in eternity. Verse 2 - Jesus
Christ, the Son of God in eternity past, Jesus Christ, the Son of Man in time,  Jesus
Christ, the faithful High Priest. Verse 3 - Jesus Christ the resurrected One, Jesus
Christ the One who conquered death for us. Verse 4 - Jesus Christ in human body
though glorified, Jesus Christ, the eternal One worthy of praise for all
eternity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scriptural basis: Rev. 19:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;His eyes are a flame of fire, and on His head are many
diadems; and He has a name written on Him which no one knows except
Himself.&quot;  (Revelation 19:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>“Day is Dying in the West” </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Background: This was the other of the two songs that Mary
Lathbury wrote while at Chautauqua Lake Summer Camp. This was adopted as the
opening hymn of the Sunday evening service for 55 years at the camp. This was
an immediately popular song. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Doctrine: Creation and Nature. Verse 1 - the holiness of
God, the omnipresence and eminence of God, the Rapture anticipated. Verse 2 - eternity
anticipated with Christ. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scriptural basis: Isaiah 6:3; Psalms 4:8; Luke 24:29.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And one called out to another and said, &quot;Holy, Holy,
Holy, is the LORD of hosts, The whole earth is full of His glory.&quot;&quot; 
(Isaiah 6:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;In peace I will both lie down and sleep, For You alone, O
LORD, make me to dwell in safety.&quot;  (Psalms 4:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But they urged Him, saying, &quot;Stay with us, for it is
getting toward evening, and the day is now nearly over.&quot; So He went in to
stay with them.&quot;  (Luke 24:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>“Dear Lord and Father of Mankind” </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Background: This hymn was written by John Greenleaf
Whittier in 1872. The setting for this song is actually in the message of
another poem, “The Brewing of Soma.” It was written by Whittier in contrast
with the great tumult and destruction of a terrible storm so described in Soma.
It reveals the deep calm and peace which stills the souls of those who hear the
message of the Gospel and respond to it in faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Doctrine: the Fatherhood of God is not at all clear in
verse 1. The doctrine of forgiveness is not correctly portrayed. It is
portrayed as being asked for rather than the result of confession of sin. The doctrine
of faith and obedience are alluded to in verse 2. The doctrines of peace,
stability and expression are expressed in a general way in verse 3. The doctrine
of prayer in verse 4 - seeking overt expression of God to teach spiritual
lessons through natural phenomenon. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scriptural basis: 1 Kings 19:11-12; Isaiah 30:15; Mark
1:17-18; Phil. 4:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So He said, &quot;Go forth and stand on the mountain
before the LORD.&quot; And behold, the LORD was passing by! And a great and
strong wind was rending the mountains and breaking in pieces the rocks before
the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind. And after the wind an earthquake,
but the LORD was not in the earthquake. After the earthquake a fire, but the
LORD was not in the fire; and after the fire a sound of a gentle
blowing.&quot;  (1 Kings 19:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For thus the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel, has said,
&quot;In repentance and rest you will be saved, In quietness and trust is your
strength.&quot; But you were not willing,&quot;  (Isaiah 30:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And Jesus said to them, &quot;Follow Me, and I will make
you become fishers of men.&quot; Immediately they left their nets and followed
Him.&quot;  (Mark 1:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension,
will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.&quot;  (Philippians 4:7,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>“Fairest Lord Jesus” </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Background: This is a German hymn written in the 17th
century. It was also called the “Crusader’s Hymn” but there is no proof that
they ever really sang it. It was published in America by Richard S. Willis in
1850. It has been associated with the fairness of Jesus at age 12 as a boy and
also with the Scripture concerning His growth in stature and wisdom. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Doctrine: Jesus as Ruler of the universe and nature.
Jesus, the perfect Son of God and perfect Son of man. Jesus, greater than
angels. Salvation which brings joy and gladness to the sinner. Jesus the
sinless One. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scriptural basis: Song of Sol. 5:16; Isaiah 60:2-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;His mouth is full of sweetness. And he is wholly
desirable. This is my beloved and this is my friend, O daughters of
Jerusalem.&quot;&quot;  (Song of Solomon 5:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;For behold, darkness will cover the earth And deep
darkness the peoples; But the LORD will rise upon you And His glory will appear
upon you. &quot;Nations will come to your light, And kings to the brightness of
your rising.&quot;  (Isaiah 60:2-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>“Faith of Our Fathers” </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Background: This was written by Frederick Faber in 1849
and probably as a result of a knowledge of the many who had died for their
faith in Jesus Christ. It has been a hymn of Christian loyalty and also closely
connected with early faith of the Fathers who founded America. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Doctrine: Faith as a quality that never dies, having
originated within man as an act of God. Faith lives on in the hearts of man
regardless of the circumstances. Undeserved suffering. Faith as the body of
content passed down through the generations and to be held most “holy.” Dying
Grace. Evangelism, “winning the nations.” Liberty, only through the Word. Balance
of the Word and life. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scriptural basis: Heb. 11:1; Heb. 11:13; Heb. 11:16; 1
Tim. 6:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the
conviction of things not seen.&quot;  (Hebrews 11:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;All these died in faith, without receiving the promises,
but having seen them and having welcomed them from a distance, and having
confessed that they were strangers and exiles on the earth.&quot;  (Hebrews
11:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a
heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for He has
prepared a city for them.&quot;  (Hebrews 11:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Fight the good fight of faith; take hold of the eternal
life to which you were called, and you made the good confession in the presence
of many witnesses.&quot;  (1 Timothy 6:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>“Fight the Good Fight” </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Background: This hymn was written by John Monsell in
1863. Not much of the background is known except that the author was apparently
writing in an effort to encourage those who were facing death for their faith.
The author was thinking back upon the time when his ancestors were killed for
their faith. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Doctrine: Spiritual Warfare: “A fight.” Christ the
strength for all believers. Maximum utilization of divine assets in time: “Lay
hold on life.” The spiritual race: “straight race” - “lay aside weight.” Trust and
faith. God’s sustaining grace. God’s immutable character. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scriptural basis: 1 Tim. 6:12; 1 Cor. 9:25-26.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Fight the good fight of faith; take hold of the eternal
life to which you were called, and you made the good confession in the presence
of many witnesses.&quot;  (1 Timothy 6:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Everyone who competes in the games exercises self-control
in all things. They then do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an
imperishable. Therefore I run in such a way, as not without aim; I box in such
a way, as not beating the air;&quot;  (1 Corinthians 9:25-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>“For the Beauty of the Earth” </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Background: This hymn was written by Folliott Pierpoint
in 1864 who, as a classic writer, wrote many poems, this being his lyrical
special. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Doctrine: Appreciation of nature. Only informed believers
can truly understand this capacity. Appreciation of time. The same is true.
Appreciation of human relationships - rapport love. Appreciation of the Body of
Christ. Praise.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scriptural basis: Psalms 104:24; Psalms 107:21. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;O LORD, how many are Your works! In wisdom You have made
them all; The earth is full of Your possessions.&quot;  (Psalms 104:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Let them give thanks to the LORD for His lovingkindness,
And for His wonders to the sons of men!&quot;  (Psalms 107:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Criticism: Only believers who are informed can appreciate
truly the glory of nature for the unsaved know nothing of the glory of God. Romans
1 tells us that unsaved man can know the power of God and the Godhead.
Salvation is not established within the hymn and it appeals rather to a sense
of man’s enjoyable pleasure rather than the Person and purpose of God who has
created this marvelous earth and abiding faculties.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>“Glorious Things of Thee Are Spoken”</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Background: This was written by a slave ship captain who
had been taught the Word as a child and had hidden much of the treasure of it
in his heart. His name was John Newton. For a while he forsook the teachings of
the Word and turned to the ways of a rough sailor and became a wild youth.
Later as a storm was about to overcome them at sea, he prayed and God answered.
He then turned to study of the Word again and eventually the ministry. From
this background, this hymn was written in 1779. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For the choir director. A Maskil of the sons of Korah. O
God, we have heard with our ears, Our fathers have told us The work that You
did in their days, In the days of old. You with Your own hand drove out the
nations; Then You planted them; You afflicted the peoples, Then You spread them
abroad. For by their own sword they did not possess the land, And their own arm
did not save them, But Your right hand and Your arm and the light of Your
presence, For You favored them.&quot;  (Psalms 44:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Background: This Christmas hymn was written by Charles
Wesley in 1739. It is said that Charles Wesley went out for a ride on his horse

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>“He Leadeth Me”</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Background: This hymn was written by Dr. Joseph Gilmore
in 1862. Dr. Gilmore had been attending Brown University and Newton Theological
Institution and during that time was asked to occupy for a couple Sundays the
pulpit at First Baptist Church in Philadelphia. During the mid-week service, he
gave an exposition of the Psalms 23. From this great Psalm, he wrote this hymn.
This hymn was born at the time of one of the darkest scenes of the American Civil
War. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scriptural basis: Psalms 23:1-3; Rev. 7:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;A Psalm of David. The LORD is my shepherd, I shall not
want. He makes me lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside quiet waters.
He restores my soul; He guides me in the paths of righteousness For His name's
sake.&quot;  (Psalms 23:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;for the Lamb in the center of the throne will be their

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>“Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty” </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Background: This hymn was written by Reginald Heber in
1827. He led a pure life as a lad and young man and later attended Oxford
University where he received honors for his Latin verse. Later he was offered
the office of bishop of Calcutta and refused it twice. Finally he accepted it.
Previous to this, he was the vicar of Hodnet for some 16 years. During this
time he wrote hymns which were significant to special Sundays of the church
year. This hymn was no doubt among this group of hymns. </p>

favorite hymn ever since it came into being. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scriptural basis: Isaiah 43:1-2; Heb. 13:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But now, thus says the LORD, your Creator, O Jacob, And
He who formed you, O Israel, &quot;Do not fear, for I have redeemed you; I have
called you by name; you are Mine! &quot;When you pass through the waters, I
will be with you; And through the rivers, they will not overflow you. When you
walk through the fire, you will not be scorched, Nor will the flame burn
you.&quot;  (Isaiah 43:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Make sure that your character is free from the love of
money, being content with what you have; for He Himself has said, &quot;I WILL
NEVER DESERT YOU, NOR WILL I EVER FORSAKE YOU,&quot;&quot;  (Hebrews 13:5,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>“I Heard the Voice of Jesus Say” </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Background: This hymn was written by the great Scottish
hymn writer, Dr. Horatius Bonar. He was educated at the University of Edinburgh
and first ministered at North Parish, Kelso. He first began writing hymns as a
student assistant in Sunday School. This hymn possibly was a result of this
experience and came into existence at that time. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Doctrine: Salvation from Matthew 11, emphasis on the
invitation. Verse 1 - salvation, personal, emphasis on his response, Christ as
the Savior who gives rest. Verse 2 - Christ in salvation, providing living
waters, Christ, the Water of Life, salvation, personal response to the Living
Water. Verse 3 - salvation, Christ the Light, personal response at salvation,
the balance between God’s grace in offering salvation and the response of man
in positive volition. He came, he drank, he looked.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scriptural basis: Matt. 11:28-30; John 6:35; John 8:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Come to Me, all who are weary and heavy-laden, and
I will give you rest. &quot;Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am
gentle and humble in heart, and YOU WILL FIND REST FOR YOUR SOULS. &quot;For My
yoke is easy and My burden is light.&quot;&quot;  (Matthew 11:28-30, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Jesus said to them, &quot;I am the bread of life; he who
comes to Me will not hunger, and he who believes in Me will never
thirst.&quot;  (John 6:35, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then Jesus again spoke to them, saying, &quot;I am the
Light of the world; he who follows Me will not walk in the darkness, but will
have the Light of life.&quot;&quot;  (John 8:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>“I Love Thy Kingdom”</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Background: This hymn was written by Timothy Dwight in
1800. He was the grandson of Johnathan Edwards. He was an outstanding scholar
and a graduate of Yale University at the age of 17 years. While in the
Continental Army, he began to write songs for the soldiers. He was a Chaplain
in the Army. He was later ordained and became President of Yale University
where he revised some of Isaac Watt’s hymns and wrote this one of his own. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Doctrine: Doctrine of the Kingdom, House and Church...all
made synonymous in verse one by the author. Doctrines of Redemption, Salvation
and the Blood of Christ referred to in verse 1.  Refers to the Church, but
there is some confusion between the Universal Church and the local church
(walls). Verse 3 - grief, undeserved suffering and prayers given in behalf of
the Church,  labor and service, the functions of the Church, her ways, her
communion, her vows, her hymns. Some ambiguity here. Glorification with some
confusion and ambiguity. Zion is made equal to the Church. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scriptural basis: Psalms 137:5-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If I forget you, O Jerusalem, May my right hand forget
her skill. May my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth If I do not remember
you, If I do not exalt Jerusalem Above my chief joy.&quot;  (Psalms 137:5-6,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>“I Need Thee Every Hour” </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Background: This hymn was written by Annie Hawks in 1872
after she came to a realization one day of the doctrine of the Omnipresence of
God. Upon the great sense of the security which this brought to her, she
realized that this which she had found was indeed that which she wanted the
most. Out of this experience, she wrote the verses for this hymn which were
later given to the pastor who composed the tune and added the refrain.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Observation: The combination of great personal need and
the apparent subjective experience meeting can result and usually does in great
doctrinal shallowness and almost a complete loss of clarity as to correct
application of the Word of God to life. This song will demonstrate some of this
confusion in life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Doctrine: An hour at a time. Verse 1 - grace is not
realized in the omnipresence of God, but rather what Jesus Christ accomplished
on the Cross. If God is omnipresent, at it is true, there is no need to pray
that it remains. Verse 2 - she desires the feeling to remain, temptations are
met in the Christian life by the Word of God used in the life of the believer.
Temptations are met in the life of the unbeliever by the stability afforded by
the strength of the Divine Institutions and learning and the proper norms and
standards in the conscience. Verse 3 - sustainment in cursing or blessing. Verse
4 - the family relationship, but misdirected to the Son rather than to the
Father. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scriptural basis: John 15:4-5; Phil. 4:19; Heb. 4:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot
bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you unless
you abide in Me. &quot;I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me
and I in him, he bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing.&quot; 
(John 15:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And my God will supply all your needs according to His
riches in glory in Christ Jesus.&quot;  (Philippians 4:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore let us draw near with confidence to the throne
of grace, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of
need.&quot;  (Hebrews 4:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>“I Would Be True” </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Background: This hymn was written by Howard Walter in
1906. This was not written as a hymn, but as a personal message to his mother.
He was a graduate of Princeton and later went to Waseda University in Tokyo, Japan.
He later was ordained into the Gospel Ministry in Connecticut. After a while,
he went to the mission field in India. He died a short time later just a young
man. This is no doubt one of the reasons this hymn is so popular and receives
so much response from the youth of today. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Doctrine: Verse 1 - characteristics of a Christian soldier:
true, pure, strong, brave. Verse 2 - the believer’s relationship to others: a
friend, giving, humble, positive, humorous, loving. Verse 3 - the spiritual
walk of the believer toward God: prayerful, busy, in fellowship, finely tuned
to the will of God, faith under undeserved suffering. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scriptural basis: Isaiah 58:6-8; Phil. 4:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Is this not the fast which I choose, To loosen the
bonds of wickedness, To undo the bands of the yoke, And to let the oppressed go
free And break every yoke? &quot;Is it not to divide your bread with the hungry
And bring the homeless poor into the house; When you see the naked, to cover
him; And not to hide yourself from your own flesh? &quot;Then your light will
break out like the dawn, And your recovery will speedily spring forth; And your
righteousness will go before you; The glory of the LORD will be your rear guard.&quot; 
(Isaiah 58:6-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is
honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is
of good repute, if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise,
dwell on these things.&quot;  (Philippians 4:8, NASB)</p>
