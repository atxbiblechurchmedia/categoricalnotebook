<h2>Hate</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Hate is defined as intense hostility and aversion usually
deriving from fear, anger, or sense of injury. An extreme dislike or disgust.
To hate is to intensely dislike someone or something, to feel extreme enmity
toward, to regard with active hostility, to have a strong aversion to, to find
very distasteful.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Greek word for hate is <span lang=EL>μισέω</span> (miseō)
in Luke 6:22-23. Hate that is directed toward the mature believer is just as
intensive as the hate that is directed toward the Lord Jesus Christ and His way
of thinking. This hatred actually destroys the one exhibiting the hate while
giving the believer involved some undeserved suffering as they maintain their fellowship
with the Lord Jesus Christ. </p>

<p class=Verses>““Blessed are you when men hate you, and ostracize you, and
insult you, and scorn your name as evil, for the sake of the Son of Man. “Be
glad in that day and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven.
For in the same way their fathers used to treat the prophets.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Luke
6:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This hatred can also be exhibited by a believer out of
fellowship or in reversionism or an unsaved religious type. The teaching of
Bible doctrine does two things. Teaching of the Word of God brings out absolute
hate and absolute love. This hate is never founded on facts, always on lies.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Special grace is given from God the Father in the Church
Age to all believers through the Holy Spirit as our Helper, <span lang=EL>παρα</span>́<span
lang=EL>κλητος</span> (paraklētos) in the Greek, who vindicates believers
because of the Bible doctrine in their soul. John 14:16; John 14:26; John 15:26;
John 16:7-33.</p>

<p class=Verses>““I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Helper,
that He may be with you forever;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 14:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in
My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I
said to you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 14:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““When the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the
Father, that is the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, He will
testify about Me,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 15:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Don’t let the hate directed toward you cause you to
stumble or move off course in your consistent intake and application of Bible
doctrine. In John 16:1-2, “stumbling” is the aorist passive subjunctive of <span
lang=EL>σκανδαλίζω</span> (skandalizō). They will separate from you and oppose
you. </p>

<p class=Verses>““These things I have spoken to you so that you may be kept
from stumbling. “They will make you outcasts from the synagogue, but an hour is
coming for everyone who kills you to think that he is offering service to God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John
16:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Their actions indicate no salvation, or if saved, no
Bible doctrine. You should be aware of hate before it comes to you. Forewarned
is forearmed. John 16:3-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>““These things they will do because they have not known the
Father or Me. “But these things I have spoken to you, so that when their hour
comes, you may remember that I told you of them. These things I did not say to
you at the beginning, because I was with you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 16:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The plan of God includes hellos and goodbyes (sorrow),
but no separation from the plan of God. John 16:5-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>““But now I am going to Him who sent Me; and none of you asks
Me, ‘Where are You going?’ “But because I have said these things to you, sorrow
has filled your heart. “But I tell you the truth, it is to your advantage that
I go away; for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but if I
go, I will send Him to you. “And He, when He comes, will convict the world
concerning sin and righteousness and judgment; concerning sin, because they do
not believe in Me; and concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father and
you no longer see Me; and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world
has been judged.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 16:5-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Many truths could not be taught by Jesus Christ to the
disciples until after He went to the Cross. Just as they had to grow as quickly
as possible to get the facts, so it is with the Church Age believer. The Holy
Spirit guides the believer in the function of the grace apparatus for
perception and spiritual growth and by testifying of our Lord, glorifies Jesus
Christ. John 16:13-14. </p>

<p class=Verses>““But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you
into all the truth; for He will not speak on His own initiative, but whatever
He hears, He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come. “He will
glorify Me, for He will take of Mine and will disclose it to you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John
16:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Knowledge of the total plan of God is the greatest
strength we can possess. Also, the intercession of Jesus Christ on our behalf
carries the believer during hate campaigns. John 16:16-33; John 17, Acts 7.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Religion’s Hatred for Paul</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Acts 25:24-25 exposes religion for what it is. Religious
leaders hated Paul, were jealous of Paul, and had implacability and
vindictiveness. Their antagonism was manifested by yelling and screaming for
his death in the courts of the Jews and the Romans.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Festus said, “King Agrippa, and all you gentlemen here present
with us, you see this man about whom all the people of the Jews appealed to me,
both at Jerusalem and here, loudly declaring that he ought not to live any
longer. “But I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death; and since
he himself appealed to the Emperor, I decided to send him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts
25:24-25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Without realizing it, Festus, in his opening remarks,
unmasked religion. Religion always places great value on life until that life
exposes them. Festus was willing to sacrifice Paul on the altar of political
expediency. Festus had no concern for the proper administration of Roman
justice. Festus was only interested in promoting Festus through ingratiation
with religious leaders. But Festus then faced the dilemma of Roman law. Paul was
no longer under the legal jurisdiction of Festus, but Festus had to provide a
report which justified Paul’s appeal.</p>
