<h2>Human Good</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Human good is a work, deed, or something done by mankind
apart from the enabling power of God the Holy Spirit. Everything done by an
unbeliever that is not a sin is called human good. Human good deceives man into
thinking they can save themselves. Adam and Eve’s first act from the old sin
nature was human good. Gen. 3:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that
they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loin
coverings.” (Genesis 3:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 28:4-5, human good is not included in the plan
of God. God does not rely on our human good or anything we can do. Grace
depends on who and what God is and there is no room for human good in His plan.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Requite them according to their work and according to the evil
of their practices; Requite them according to the deeds of their hands; Repay
them their recompense. Because they do not regard the works of the LORD Nor the
deeds of His hands, He will tear them down and not build them up.” (Psalms
28:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For the believer, anything thought or done that is not
considered by God to be a sin and done while in a state of carnality where the
old sin nature controls the soul is considered by God to be human good. The
things you do in fellowship that are divine good, are human good when you are
out of fellowship! The #1 enemy in the Christian Life is human good. Human good
soothes the conscience and keeps the believer from confessing their sins
biblically using 1 John 1:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Dead works is human good. This is the divine viewpoint of
human good. Heb. 6:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore leaving the elementary teaching about the Christ,
let us press on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from
dead works and of faith toward God,” (Hebrews 6:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Human good was rejected at the Cross and cannot save man.
Eph. 2:8-9; Titus 3:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not
of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one
may boast.” (Ephesians 2:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done in
righteousness, but according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration and
renewing by the Holy Spirit,” (Titus 3:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Human good is a product of the old sin nature when in
carnality and is never acceptable to God. Human good continues to be
unacceptable to God after salvation. Isaiah 64:6; Rom. 8:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For all of us have become like one who is unclean, And all our
righteous deeds are like a filthy garment; And all of us wither like a leaf,
And our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.” (Isaiah 64:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and those who are in the flesh cannot please God.” (Romans
8:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For the unbeliever, their rejection of Jesus Christ as
Savior is the one and only basis for their judgment at the Great White Throne
Judgment. Their human good production will be read from the Book of Works and
will be found inadequate by Jesus Christ. Rev. 20:12-15. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before
the throne, and books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the
book of life; and the dead were judged from the things which were written in
the books, according to their deeds. And the sea gave up the dead which were in
it, and death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them; and they were
judged, every one of them according to their deeds. Then death and Hades were
thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire. And
if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into
the lake of fire.” (Revelation 20:12-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The average person in America today believes that if they
lead a moral life or live by some ethical standard, they are a Christian.
Christianity is neither a life of morality or a life of ethics, but a personal
relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For the believer, human good is condemned by God and will
be judged and removed at the Judgment Seat of Christ that will take place in
heaven during the Tribulation on earth. Human good has no part in eternity and
is therefore judged and permanently removed. 1 Cor. 3:11-16; Eccl. 12:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For no man can lay a foundation other than the one which is
laid, which is Jesus Christ. Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold,
silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, each man's work will become evident;
for the day will show it because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire
itself will test the quality of each man's work. If any man's work which he has
built on it remains, he will receive a reward. If any man's work is burned up,
he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire. Do
you not know that you are a temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in
you?” (1 Corinthians 3:11-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For God will bring every act to judgment, everything which is
hidden, whether it is good or evil.” (Ecclesiastes 12:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Human good was rejected at the Cross. Human works are
never accepted for redemption and accumulated human good will be burned at the
Judgment Seat of Christ. Divine good performed only while filled with the Holy
Spirit is viewed as gold, silver, and precious stones in this analogy and is
acceptable to God. In contrast, human good generated in carnality is viewed as
wood, hay, and straw and will be burned away as unacceptable to God. 2 Cor.
5:10; Rom. 14:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so
that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body, according to what
he has done, whether good or bad.” (2 Corinthians 5:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But you, why do you judge your brother? Or you again, why do
you regard your brother with contempt? For we will all stand before the
judgment seat of God.” (Romans 14:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Human good is not categorized as sin, although it is just
as unacceptable to God because it was generated in the energy of the flesh –
while in a state of carnality. Human good is different from sin in that human
good does not involve a moral issue. Giving money, for example, to the local
church would not be classified as sin, but if the person were unsaved, it would
be human good. If it were a believer out of fellowship, it would be human good.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Human good is actually religion where a person is either
working their way into heaven (an impossibility) or a believer is thinking
human good is acceptable to God. Human good is not confessed as sin. It is
taken care of by staying in fellowship. When in fellowship, divine good is
produced.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Human good is actually a Satanic concept. One of the
greatest exhibits of the cunning nature of Satan is the promotion of his
doctrine through the social gospel with concepts of world peace,
internationalism, economic ventures, “do-gooders”, doing good in the name of
good and religious endeavors. Satan would love to abolish war and get the
credit for it. 2 Thess. 2:9; 1 Tim. 4:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“that is, the one whose coming is in accord with the activity
of Satan, with all power and signs and false wonders,” (2 Thessalonians 2:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will
fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and doctrines
of demons,” (1 Timothy 4:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A distinction should be made between human good and
morality. Morality does not save, however morality is a by-product of
Christianity. Morality is essential for the orderly function of the human race
under the four Divine Institutions (volition, marriage, family, and
nationalism).</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Thus, morality is designed by God for the continuance of
the human race in the Angelic Conflict and protects human freedom as a basis
for response to evangelism. Whereas morality is not condemned in this capacity,
but human good is always condemned.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Morality minus spirituality causes legalism, religion’s
activities, self-righteousness and hypocrisy in the believer. The answer to
human good is divine good. Divine good is produced in the believer always based
on the filling of the Holy Spirit. Gal. 5:22-23. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience,
kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things
there is no law.” (Galatians 5:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>While in fellowship, divine good is produced from the
application of <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine from the right lobe of the soul.
Eph. 4:22-23; Luke 2:40; Luke 2:52. See category on <a href="#_Divine_Good">Divine
Good</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“that, in reference to your former manner of life, you lay
aside the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of
deceit, and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind,” (Ephesians
4:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The Child continued to grow and become strong, increasing in
wisdom; and the grace of God was upon Him.” (Luke 2:40, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And Jesus kept increasing in wisdom and stature, and in favor
with God and men.” (Luke 2:52, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One of the great themes of the Bible is human good versus
divine good. Satan promotes human good. God produces divine good. Divine good
is also produced from the erection of the edification complex of the soul. John
1:14. Jesus Christ illustrates how divine good is produced in John 3:34 and
Matthew 4:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw His
glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.”
(John 1:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for He
gives the Spirit without measure.” (John 3:34, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be
tempted by the devil.” (Matthew 4:1, NASB)</p>
