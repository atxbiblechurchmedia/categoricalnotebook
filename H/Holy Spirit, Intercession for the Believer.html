<h2>Holy Spirit, Intercession for the Believer</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In what ways can a believer be helpless? A believer can
be helpless with mental illness with their volition stuck in neutral. You are
helpless when in a coma or when you are unconscious. You are helpless when one
is in shock but conscious. You are helpless when an imbalance of hormones
occurs. You are helpless when one is paralyzed as in electrocution. You are
helpless when one is delirious and in a state of hysteria or panic. You are
helpless when an unexpected tragedy which leaves one completely speechless,
unable to think.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A coma, a seizure, being unconscious are all part of the
undeserved suffering package. Instead of healing the situation, God gives an
extra measure of grace and is thereby glorified. This is beyond your prayer,
the Holy Spirit is praying. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Just as the mentally ill person has a provision for no
responsibility when they are in neutral volition, to flush the soul, so the
physical defect of body is provided for by the prayers of the indwelling Holy
Spirit. The Holy Spirit intercedes for us and protects us as He indwells our
bodies. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The plan of God is greater than then worst suffering life
can bring. God's grace is always in view in suffering. For the believer who
confesses sin to God the Father and is again filled with the Holy Spirit and
applying Bible doctrine to the situation, cursing of divine discipline is
turned to blessing. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 8:26, “In the same way” is <span lang=EL>ω</span>̔<span
lang=EL>σαυ</span>́<span lang=EL>τως</span> (hōsautōs) in the Greek and means
in like manner, likewise. This indicates that the ministry of the Holy Spirit
is distinct from and greater than the groaning of creation and believers. It is
far superior! “Helps” is a triple compound verb <span lang=EL>συναντιλαμβα</span>́<span
lang=EL>νομαι</span> (sunantilambanomai) where <i>sun</i> is a preposition of
assistance, <i>anti</i> is in turn, or in place of, and the root <i>lambanomai</i>
means to seize, to assist. It means to support someone who is in a hopeless and
helpless situation, to come to the aid of someone, to pray on their behalf. </p>

<p class=Verses>“In the same way the Spirit also helps our weakness; for we do
not know how to pray as we should, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us
with groanings too deep for words;” (Romans 8:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 8:26, “our weakness” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span
lang=EL>σθε</span>́<span lang=EL>νεια</span> (astheneia) and means our
hopelessness (in context), our helplessness, to be weak, to lack strength, to
not know what to do, to be impotent, to have much inability. It takes thought
to pray, to use faith, to apply. There are times when you cannot. The principle
here is that the Holy Spirit protects you and prays for you so no one can
tamper with your volition when it cannot operate. It is the same principle as
children in innocence when they are not yet able to exercise their volition.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 8:26, “for we do not know” is the negative plus
the perfect active indicative of <span lang=EL>οι</span>̓͂<span lang=EL>δα</span>
(oida) in the Greek and means to not have seen or perceived. This is a strong
negative and is used as a dramatic present. The soul is not functioning
(self-consciousness, mentality, etc.). “How to pray as we should” is the future
middle indicative and means the Holy Spirit benefits us when we cannot benefit
ourselves. Prayer from the believer would only be beneficial when the believer
can think, but when that is knocked out, the Holy Spirit takes over.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Pray” is <span lang=EL>προσευ</span>́<span lang=EL>χομαι</span>
(proseuchomai) and means the Holy Spirit is face to face with the Father in
intercession for us! The believer cannot confess their sins and they just
cannot function! In this situation, the Holy Spirit takes over. The principle
here is that you come out of a period of suffering, not because you know
doctrine, but because of the great unseen ministry of the Holy Spirit praying
from inside the believer.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 8:26, “but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us”
is the present active indicative of  <span lang=EL>υ</span>̔<span lang=EL>περεντυγχα</span>́<span
lang=EL>νω</span> (huperentugchanō) and means to plead continually on behalf
of one who is helpless. This word is only used once in New Testament. “With
groanings too deep for words” means unutterable groanings. The content of the
prayer is not given, but the prayer is offered by the Holy Spirit from inside
of the believer. You do not pray to the Holy Spirit or to Jesus Christ, only to
God the Father.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 8:27, it is God the Father who answers the
prayer. “He who searches” is the present active participle of <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span
lang=EL>ρευνα</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (ereunaō) and means to search, to
examine and the refers to God the Father who keeps on searching and examining.
The Father examines the believer’s spiritual growth and coordinates the
intercession furthering the will of God. The Father knows when you can think
and when you cannot. The Father keeps track of our soul and knows when it is in
shock, in neutral, or in the throes of mental or severe physical illness. “The
hearts” is <span lang=EL>καρδι</span>́<span lang=EL>α</span> (kardia) and
refers to the right lobe of the soul and “knows” is the perfect tense used as a
present of <span lang=EL>οι</span>̓͂<span lang=EL>δα</span> (oida) and means
that God the Father understands the prayers of God the Holy Spirit. </p>

<p class=Verses>“and He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the
Spirit is, because He intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.”
(Romans 8:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“The mind of the Spirit” refers to prayer as mental
communication, but thoughts were behind those words. “Because He intercedes” is
the present active indicative of <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>ντυγχα</span>́<span
lang=EL>νω</span> (entugchanō) and means He keeps on making intercession. This
is a continuous ministry of the Holy Spirit. He is faithful in all generations
of believers. “According” is <span lang=EL>κατα</span>́ (kata) and means it is
according to the norm or standard of Bible doctrine, God’s thinking. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A defective physical body cannot deter the God's grace
plan for you. The believer need not be hindered with undeserved suffering. Even
the earth is cursed. Your body is defective. In Romans 8:28, “all things” are
the complete picture. All things work together for good. Cursing is turned into
blessing in God’s plan. Even the earth will be delivered from its curse, your
body from its curse, but in the meantime, we are to live our lives as unto the
Lord. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And we know that God causes all things to work together for
good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.”
(Romans 8:28, NASB)</p>
