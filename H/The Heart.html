<h2>The Heart</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the mentality of the soul there are two frontal lobes.
The left lobe is the perceptive lobe called the mind. The right lobe is the
dominant lobe called the heart. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The heart is the right lobe of the soul that contains <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine and therefore vital in the function of the grace apparatus for
perception. Bible doctrine resides in the right lobe of the soul where the edification
complex of the soul is built. This is the only place <i>epignosis</i> Bible
doctrine is stored in the soul. See category on the <a
href="#_Grace_Apparatus_For">Grace Apparatus For Perception</a>. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Areas or Compartments of the Heart</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The heart or the right lobe of the soul contains the
Frame of Reference, the Memory Center, Vocabulary Storage, Categorical Storage,
the Conscience, Spiritual Growth, and Wisdom. These areas for storage and
application of <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine are located in the right lobe of
the mentality of the soul. They all participate in the believer’s application
of <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine to life. They are:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'><i>The Frame of
Reference </i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'><i>The Memory
Center</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'><i>Vocabulary
Storage</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'><i>Categorical
Storage</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'><i>The
Conscience</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'><i>Spiritual
Growth </i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'><i>Wisdom </i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Frame of Reference</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The frame of reference is where previously believed <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine is retained in the right lobe of the soul. It is where new
doctrines enter and are related to previously learned doctrines as they are
transferred from the left lobe of the soul by the Holy Spirit. The frame of
reference is where <i>epignosis</i> doctrine becomes the foundation for
learning more advanced doctrine. Eph. 3:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that
you may be filled up to all the fullness of God.” (Ephesians 3:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The purpose of the frame of reference is; to enable
comprehension of more advanced doctrines, to set up divine norms and standards
in the conscience, to look at life with divine viewpoint, to give correct
content to your prayers, to give accuracy in your witnessing, and to resolve
all of the problems of the subconscious mind such as bad dreams, guilt
complexes, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Application of <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine to life’s
situations and decisions is called divine wisdom and comes from the frame of
reference.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Epignosis</i> doctrine in the frame of reference is
the basis for the construction of the edification complex of the soul. The
amount of Bible doctrine retained in your frame of reference is what determines
your spiritual IQ. Bible doctrine in the frame of reference increases your
spiritual IQ and provides the basis for learning more advanced doctrines. Prov.
4:4; 1 Cor. 2:9. See category on <a href="#_D-The_Edification_Complex">The
Edification Complex of the Soul</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then he taught me and said to me, &quot;Let your heart hold
fast my words; Keep my commandments and live;” (Proverbs 4:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“but just as it is written, &quot;THINGS WHICH EYE HAS NOT SEEN
AND EAR HAS NOT HEARD, AND which HAVE NOT ENTERED THE HEART OF MAN, ALL THAT
GOD HAS PREPARED FOR THOSE WHO LOVE HIM.&quot;” (1 Corinthians 2:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Bible doctrine in the frame of reference provides divine
viewpoint and shapes your mental attitude in the spiritual life. Your ability
and motivation for concentration starts with your frame of reference. There is
no way the believer can understand God’s plan or the grace resources He has
provided apart from the Bible doctrine in your frame of reference.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Many believers have been delivered from false doctrinal
because of the discernment obtained from the <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in
their frame of reference. Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the soul with the
filling of the Holy Spirit provide an instinct for discerning false teaching. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This doctrinal discernment is critical to the spiritual
life because you learn to avoid the false teaching, those involved in error in
the spiritual realm, and phony Christian service which is used to beguile new
believers. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The frame of reference provides the basis for effective
communication of ideas in conversation, in public speaking, in witnessing, and
in social interaction. The frame of reference provides capacity for life, love,
and happiness. The Bible doctrine residing there raises your spiritual IQ and
motivates general learning and understanding of life. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Memory Center</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The memory center is where <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine
is stored such that the Holy Spirit enables the believer to focus on what doctrinal
principles or rationales are applicable to a given situation in life. Psalms
119:5-7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Oh that my ways may be established To keep Your statutes! Then
I shall not be ashamed When I look upon all Your commandments. I shall give
thanks to You with uprightness of heart, When I learn Your righteous
judgments.” (Psalms 119:5-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>While the frame of reference is where doctrines are
stored and classified, the memory center is used to recall Bible doctrine from
all areas of the right lobe of the soul. Recall is necessary for the
application of doctrine to experience and for worship. You associate things in
your frame of reference and then remember them from the function of the memory
center. After a lot of repetition, the memory center also stores Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Recall is the application of the doctrinal rationales to
the circumstances of life under the enabling power of the Holy Spirit. Recall
has nothing to do with whether or not you have a good memory.  It has
everything to do with the learning and understanding of Bible doctrine.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You cannot use what you cannot recall. You can’t look up
the applicable doctrine in your written notes when you’re being tested. The
divine solutions must already be in your soul. You can only apply what you have
learned. Therefore, recall is the application of <i>epignosis</i> doctrine in
the right lobe to the circumstances of life.  When <i>epignosis</i> doctrine is
applied, it is called wisdom or <span lang=EL>σοφι</span>́<span lang=EL>α</span>
(sophia) in the Greek. Lam. 3:20-24.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Surely my soul remembers And is bowed down within me. This I
recall to my mind, Therefore I have hope. The LORD'S lovingkindnesses indeed
never cease, For His compassions never fail. They are new every morning; Great
is Your faithfulness. &quot;The LORD is my portion,&quot; says my soul,
&quot;Therefore I have hope in Him.&quot;” (Lamentations 3:20-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The frame of reference plus the memory center equals the
recall of doctrine. In Psalms 119:109, the young people on that long cruel
march from Jerusalem to Babylon recalled Bible doctrine in their souls as they
were cruelly treated and abused. They had learned the doctrine and recalled it
under the most horrific of circumstances. Psalms 119:109. See category on <a
href="#_D-Maximum_Adversity,_The">Maximum Adversity, The Believer's Triumph.</a></p>

<p class=Verses>“My life is continually in my hand, Yet I do not forget Your
law.” (Psalms 119:109, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 10:4-6, the issue is the believer’s defensive
spiritual weaponry in the Angelic Conflict. You must have the right spiritual
weapons. Consistent intake and application of Bible doctrine reveals the grace
resources and God's enabling power needed to arm yourself spiritually. God
provides the spiritual weaponry and the enabling power in the spiritual life.
“We are ready” refers to <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the frame of
reference and in the memory center.</p>

<p class=Verses>“for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but
divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses. We are destroying
speculations and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God, and
we are taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ, and we are
ready to punish all disobedience, whenever your obedience is complete.” (2
Corinthians 10:4-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Vocabulary Storage</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Vocabulary Storage is where your thinking develops and
where technical words are stored.  Your thinking depends on your vocabulary.
Vocabulary is developed in the left lobe and only transferred to the right lobe
when believed as part of the <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine that we have
learned.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>After salvation, the believer must learn an entirely new
spiritual vocabulary associated with Bible doctrine and the Word of God in
general. This includes technical theological words required for divine
viewpoint thinking, for application of Bible doctrine to life, and for
conversations with other believers and with unbelievers when conveying the
Gospel.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Children must learn the language and the meaning of words
of the society in which they live. So also must new believers learn the
language of the Word of God to understand God's plan for their lives. This
language of the spiritual life includes technical, theological terminology. Matt.
4:4; Jer. 15:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But He answered and said, &quot;It is written, 'MAN SHALL NOT
LIVE ON BREAD ALONE, BUT ON EVERY WORD THAT PROCEEDS OUT OF THE MOUTH OF
GOD.'&quot;” (Matthew 4:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Your words were found and I ate them, And Your words became
for me a joy and the delight of my heart; For I have been called by Your name,
O LORD God of hosts.” (Jeremiah 15:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Categorical Storage</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Categorical storage is where individual doctrines are
formed into rationales for application to life. Categorical doctrinal storage
is coordinated with the frame of reference and classifies Bible doctrines. This
is where technical spiritual concepts or categorical information is stored.
These doctrinal concepts or categories are related to recall from both the
memory center and vocabulary compartments. When you remember doctrinal
principles and terminology, you associate them into categories for application.
Rom. 8:16; Eph. 3:18-19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are
children of God,” (Romans 8:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the
breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ which
surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God.”
(Ephesians 3:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Word of God presents certain subjects in various
parts of Scripture where they are covered from different viewpoints, but are
still part of the same subject. Categories are fundamental concepts of Bible
doctrine. Categories divide the entire Word of God into logical subjects for
understanding, for relating and combining with other related doctrines, and for
application to certain situations and decisions in life. Categories of doctrine
enable a higher level or more advances divine viewpoint thinking in the
spiritual life. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Both vocabulary and categorical storage are essential to
spiritual growth and the execution of God’s plan. In Proverbs 2:2 and Proverbs
2:6, “wisdom” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL>חכמה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(chokmâh) in the Hebrew and is the same
meaning as “knowledge” or <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>πι</span>́<span
lang=EL>γνωσις</span> (epignōsis) in 2 Peter 1:2-3 plus “wisdom” or <span
lang=EL>σοφι</span>́<span lang=EL>α</span> (sophia) in Ephesians 3:10. Wisdom
is the combination of <i>epignosis</i> coming into your right lobe as well as
being applied from your right lobe.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Make your ear attentive to wisdom, Incline your heart to
understanding;” (Proverbs 2:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the LORD gives wisdom; From His mouth come knowledge and
understanding.” (Proverbs 2:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God
and of Jesus our Lord; seeing that His divine power has granted to us
everything pertaining to life and godliness, through the true knowledge of Him
who called us by His own glory and excellence.” (2 Peter 1:2-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“so that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known
through the church to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly places.”
(Ephesians 3:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Epignosis</i> Bible doctrine circulates through the
frame of reference, memory center, vocabulary, and categorical storage areas.
Without concentration on and positive volition toward what is taught, you will
not develop vocabulary or categorical storage of doctrinal information. Prov.
2:10; Prov. 3:3; Prov. 15:14-15; Prov. 18:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For wisdom will enter your heart And knowledge will be
pleasant to your soul;” (Proverbs 2:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do not let kindness and truth leave you; Bind them around your
neck, Write them on the tablet of your heart.” (Proverbs 3:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The mind of the intelligent seeks knowledge, But the mouth of
fools feeds on folly. All the days of the afflicted are bad, But a cheerful
heart has a continual feast.” (Proverbs 15:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The mind of the prudent acquires knowledge, And the ear of the
wise seeks knowledge.” (Proverbs 18:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 18:15, the “mind of the prudent” is spiritual
growth and acquires knowledge through the grace apparatus for perception. The
“ear of the wise” is positive volition that continually seeks more Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Categorical storage is analogous to how we group
information in general by putting words into sentences, sentences into
paragraphs, paragraphs into chapters, and chapters into books. It is awareness
of the various doctrinal categories used to communicate information to the
believer.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Knowledge is built on knowledge. Simple categories of
Bible doctrine lead to the more complex categories of doctrine and the
formation of biblical categories.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is easy to mix the God's promises with faith in
faith-rest. But to apply divine solutions to a complicated problem or decision
in your life, you must be able to apply entire categories and related
categories of Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Your Bible doctrine vocabulary and categorical storage
are essential for spiritual growth. The technical vocabulary of Bible doctrine
is necessary to understand God's plan for your life and to live that spiritual
life to fulfill His plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Many doctrines can only be explained in terms of logical
progression or mechanics. All Bible doctrine terminology has an associated
technical and theological explanation. Therefore, technical doctrinal
terminology is necessary.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine must be stored in
both the vocabulary and categorical storage areas of the soul’s right lobe.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Conscience</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Your conscience is the place in the right lobe of your
soul for the spiritual norms and standards developed from <i>epignosis</i> Bible
doctrine. The carnal norms and standards are developed from your old sin
nature. Your decisions are generally based on your conscience. Your good
decisions are based on your doctrinal norms and standards. Your bad decisions
are based on your carnal norms and standards.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You must be able to think with a vocabulary to describe
your thoughts. The more developed your vocabulary, the more developed are your
norms and standards. The conscience is built on negative words which forbid
doing something. The conscience of man first establishes negatives and later
develops both positives and negatives. These norms and standards become the
priorities of your soul. Dan. 1:8; Rom. 2:14-15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But Daniel made up his mind that he would not defile himself
with the king's choice food or with the wine which he drank; so he sought
permission from the commander of the officials that he might not defile
himself.” (Daniel 1:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For when Gentiles who do not have the Law do instinctively the
things of the Law, these, not having the Law, are a law to themselves, in that
they show the work of the Law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing
witness and their thoughts alternately accusing or else defending them,”
(Romans 2:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You orient to whether you are doing something right or
wrong based on your established norms and standards. The conscience is the
storage area for your norms and standards and priorities in life. Rom. 9:1; Rom.
13:5; 1 Cor. 8:7; 2 Cor. 4:2; 2 Cor. 5:11; Titus 1:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I am telling the truth in Christ, I am not lying, my
conscience testifies with me in the Holy Spirit,” (Romans 9:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore it is necessary to be in subjection, not only
because of wrath, but also for conscience' sake.” (Romans 13:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“However not all men have this knowledge; but some, being
accustomed to the idol until now, eat food as if it were sacrificed to an idol;
and their conscience being weak is defiled.” (1 Corinthians 8:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“but we have renounced the things hidden because of shame, not
walking in craftiness or adulterating the word of God, but by the manifestation
of truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.”
(2 Corinthians 4:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but
we are made manifest to God; and I hope that we are made manifest also in your
consciences.” (2 Corinthians 5:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled
and unbelieving, nothing is pure, but both their mind and their conscience are
defiled.” (Titus 1:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All normal people have norms and standards which are
located in the right lobe or heart of the mentality of the soul. From these
norms and standards come individual priorities in life. Your priorities form
your scale of values. False norms and standards produce a weak conscience.  1
Cor. 8:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“However not all men have this knowledge; but some, being
accustomed to the idol until now, eat food as if it were sacrificed to an idol;
and their conscience being weak is defiled.” (1 Corinthians 8:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the early Church, some of the best food in Corinth had
been offered to idols and then sold as the choicest meat in the temple market.
It was biblically acceptable to eat that food once you sanctified it. However,
weaker believers present with idolatrous backgrounds and a weak conscience,
found eating such food to be offensive. The one with the weak conscience had
legalistic norms and standards in their conscience from their religious
background.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This set up a conflict between those with a strong
conscience and those with a weak conscience. A strong conscience has biblical
standards from <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine.  A weak conscience lives by
standards acquired from the believer’s background, which may be good or bad
creating a distorted spiritual life. Eating is a physical issue and has nothing
to do with the spiritual life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer with a weak conscience assumes they’re
strong, because legalism always assumes it is strong. The conscience is very
sensitive and can be erroneous in its concepts apart from Bible doctrine.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Your norms and standards are primarily directed toward
man until you become aware of the existence of God and what He has done for
you. Acts 24:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;In view of this, I also do my best to maintain always a
blameless conscience both before God and before men.” (Acts 24:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Your spiritual strength is developed from biblical norms
and standards of doctrine toward both God and man. The spiritually advancing
believer will build up doctrinal norms and standards while setting aside false
norms and standards. 2 Cor. 4:2; Heb. 9:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but we have renounced the things hidden because of shame, not
walking in craftiness or adulterating the word of God, but by the manifestation
of truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.”
(2 Corinthians 4:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the
eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience
from dead works to serve the living God?” (Hebrews 9:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer’s conscience demands that they submit to
legitimate authority. Divine viewpoint thinking means you don’t refrain from
criminal activity because you fear punishment, but because your doctrinal norms
and standards tell you it is wrong because it does not line up with the Word of
God. Rom. 13:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore it is necessary to be in subjection, not only
because of wrath, but also for conscience' sake.” (Romans 13:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The doctrinal norms and standards in your conscience
makes your prayers more effective. Paul didn’t pray for people because he liked
them, but for his conscience sake, which is the strongest possible motivation. 2
Tim. 1:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I thank God, whom I serve with a clear conscience the way my
forefathers did, as I constantly remember you in my prayers night and day,” (2
Timothy 1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Your conscience is related to unjust and unfair
treatment. 1 Peter 2:18-19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Servants, be submissive to your masters with all respect, not
only to those who are good and gentle, but also to those who are unreasonable.
For this finds favor, if for the sake of conscience toward God a person bears
up under sorrows when suffering unjustly.” (1 Peter 2:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You may not like some people in authority over you and
think they are unfair, but you are mandated to submit to their authority and to
do the best job possible with a good attitude. This is working as unto the
Lord. The growing believer in fellowship has a strong conscience. The weak
believer and often one out of fellowship will complain and reject legitimate
authority. It’s very important to have norms and standards in your conscience
based on <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine so you can handle unjust treatment. In
this way, the believer can apply Bible doctrine to the situation and stay in
fellowship using God's grace resources, thus enduring undeserved suffering for
blessing. 1 Peter 3:14-16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness,
you are blessed. AND DO NOT FEAR THEIR INTIMIDATION, AND DO NOT BE TROUBLED,
but sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, always being ready to make a
defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in
you, yet with gentleness and reverence; and keep a good conscience so that in
the thing in which you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in
Christ will be put to shame.” (1 Peter 3:14-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If you have a strong conscience, you will leave the issue
in the Lord’s hands. Believers with a weak conscience have become negative to
the Word of God and are into false teaching. This destroys the doctrinal norms
and standards. 1 Tim. 4:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will
fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and doctrines
of demons, by means of the hypocrisy of liars seared in their own conscience as
with a branding iron,” (1 Timothy 4:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>False teaching sears the conscience like a branding iron
and destroys it. This is the buildup of scar tissue of the soul. Apostasy can
destroy the conscience. However, you can reverse that by returning to the
intake and application of Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Spiritual Growth </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual growth results from having <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine in the frame of reference, the memory center, vocabulary
storage, categorical storage, and developing norms and standards in the
conscience. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Accelerated spiritual growth comes from the application
of <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine under pressure and underserved suffering for
blessing in adversity.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We all learn from the suffering brought on by the
consequences of our own bad decisions and resultant self-induced misery. This
is learning the hard way and does not advance your spiritual growth unless you
have confessed your sins to God the Father and regained the filling of the Holy
Spirit.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Wisdom</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The wisdom area of the soul is used for application of <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine to life’s situations, problems, and decision making. The wisdom area
is connected with your memory center. This is the application area. The wisdom area
takes recalled Bible doctrine and applies it to experience under the function
of your royal priesthood. 1 Cor. 1:30; James 3:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But by His doing you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us
wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption,” (1
Corinthians 1:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable,
gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, unwavering, without
hypocrisy.” (James 3:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The wisdom area is where thought becomes action in the
spiritual life. You apply Bible doctrine based on your spiritual norms and
standards. All other areas of the right lobe work together using the enabling
power of the Holy Spirit to correctly apply the right doctrine to the right
situation. This is spiritual discernment. The more doctrine you apply while
filled with the Holy Spirit, the more divine wisdom you develop. 1 Cor. 2:7-8;
Phil. 4:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but we speak God's wisdom in a mystery, the hidden wisdom
which God predestined before the ages to our glory; the wisdom which none of
the rulers of this age has understood; for if they had understood it they would
not have crucified the Lord of glory;” (1 Corinthians 2:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable,
whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of good
repute, if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise, dwell on
these things.” (Philippians 4:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The heart is the function of the soul. Spiritual maturity
results from maximum divine viewpoint thinking in the right lobe. This is also
called wisdom. Divine viewpoint motivates the believer to seek out even more
divine truth. Prov.15:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The mind of the intelligent seeks knowledge, But the mouth of
fools feeds on folly.” (Proverbs 15:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 8:1-6, wisdom is personified. Wisdom is
accumulated <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the right lobe that has been
applied to life’s problems, situations, and decisions many times. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Does not wisdom call, And understanding lift up her voice? On
top of the heights beside the way, Where the paths meet, she takes her stand;
Beside the gates, at the opening to the city, At the entrance of the doors, she
cries out: &quot;To you, O men, I call, And my voice is to the sons of men.
&quot;O naive ones, understand prudence; And, O fools, understand wisdom.
&quot;Listen, for I will speak noble things; And the opening of my lips will
reveal right things.” (Proverbs 8:1-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Capacities of the Heart or Soul</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The dominant lobe of the soul or the heart is the
location for spiritual content that gives capacity for life. Doctrine activates
life through the right lobe. Psalms 19:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart Be
acceptable in Your sight, O LORD, my rock and my Redeemer.” (Psalms 19:14,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It isn’t what you think in your mind that defines you,
it’s what you think in your right lobe or heart that defines you. Prov. 23:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For as he thinks within himself, so he is. He says to you,
&quot;Eat and drink!&quot; But his heart is not with you.” (Proverbs 23:7,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Positive Capacities</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The right lobe of the believer’s soul is the source of
all spiritual capacity in the spiritual life - capacity for life, capacity for
love of God and others, and sharing the happiness of God. 1 Peter 1:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Since you have in obedience to the truth purified your souls
for a sincere love of the brethren, fervently love one another from the heart,”
(1 Peter 1:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the heart or right lobe resides the Bible doctrine
that results in capacity for love. This includes the emotions. Deut. 6:5; Deut.
11:13; Joshua 22:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and
with all your soul and with all your might. &quot;These words, which I am
commanding you today, shall be on your heart.” (Deuteronomy 6:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;It shall come about, if you listen obediently to my
commandments which I am commanding you today, to love the LORD your God and to
serve Him with all your heart and all your soul,” (Deuteronomy 11:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Only be very careful to observe the commandment and the
law which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, to love the LORD your
God and walk in all His ways and keep His commandments and hold fast to Him and
serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul.&quot;” (Joshua 22:5,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The heart is the source of true happiness and confidence
in life because of our trust in the Lord’s protection and grace provision. Psalms
9:9-10; Psalms 28:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD also will be a stronghold for the oppressed, A
stronghold in times of trouble; And those who know Your name will put their
trust in You, For You, O LORD, have not forsaken those who seek You.” (Psalms
9:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD is my strength and my shield; My heart trusts in Him,
and I am helped; Therefore my heart exults, And with my song I shall thank
Him.” (Psalms 28:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Bible doctrine is the mind of Jesus Christ and changes
the soul. It is the Holy Spirit that actually renovates the soul and the
believer’s thinking. This is the spiritual maturing of the believer as divine
viewpoint replaces human viewpoint in the right lobe of the soul. This also
results in stability of thinking. 1 Cor. 2:16; Titus 3:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT
HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.” (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done in
righteousness, but according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration and
renewing by the Holy Spirit,” (Titus 3:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Happiness is having Bible doctrine in the right lobe of
the soul and applying it to life’s challenges. Psalms 19:8; 1 Sam. 2:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The precepts of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart; The
commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.” (Psalms 19:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Hannah prayed and said, &quot;My heart exults in the
LORD; My horn is exalted in the LORD, My mouth speaks boldly against my
enemies, Because I rejoice in Your salvation.” (1 Samuel 2:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As we grow spiritually, we become aware of God's divine
protection in tough situations. By our faith, we come to rely on His protection
in the spiritual life instead of our own inadequate abilities. Psalms 28:7;
Psalms 3:3; Job 9:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD is my strength and my shield; My heart trusts in Him,
and I am helped; Therefore my heart exults, And with my song I shall thank
Him.” (Psalms 28:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But You, O LORD, are a shield about me, My glory, and the One
who lifts my head.” (Psalms 3:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Wise in heart and mighty in strength, Who has defied Him
without harm?” (Job 9:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The heart is related to the grace function and grace
orientation. Prov. 24:17; Exodus 23:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do not rejoice when your enemy falls, And do not let your
heart be glad when he stumbles;” (Proverbs 24:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You shall not oppress a stranger, since you yourselves
know the feelings of a stranger, for you also were strangers in the land of
Egypt.” (Exodus 23:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The heart is the basis of stability in a crises. Psalms
112:7-8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He will not fear evil tidings; His heart is steadfast,
trusting in the LORD. His heart is upheld, he will not fear, Until he looks
with satisfaction on his adversaries.” (Psalms 112:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The heart is the motivator for the spiritual life. 2 Cor.
9:7; 1 Kings 8:17. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Each one must do just as he has purposed in his heart, not
grudgingly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.” (2 Corinthians
9:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Now it was in the heart of my father David to build a
house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel.” (1 Kings 8:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The heart is the motivator for temporal life. Exodus
35:25-26; Exodus 36:36-37.</p>

<p class=Verses>“All the skilled women spun with their hands, and brought what
they had spun, in blue and purple and scarlet material and in fine linen. All
the women whose heart stirred with a skill spun the goats' hair.” (Exodus
35:25-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He made four pillars of acacia for it, and overlaid them with
gold, with their hooks of gold; and he cast four sockets of silver for them. He
made a screen for the doorway of the tent, of blue and purple and scarlet
material, and fine twisted linen, the work of a weaver;” (Exodus 36:36-37,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Positive faith belief in the Gospel and Bible doctrine
results in the Holy Spirit converting what you have believed into <i>epignosis</i>
and placing it in the heart or right lobe. Rom. 10:9-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe
in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved; for with
the heart a person believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he
confesses, resulting in salvation.” (Romans 10:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The heart with Bible doctrine contained in the
edification complex of the soul becomes the basic area for happiness in life.
Judges 18:20; 1 Kings 8:66; 2 Chron. 7:10; Esther 5:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod and
household idols and the graven image and went among the people.” (Judges 18:20,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“On the eighth day he sent the people away and they blessed the
king. Then they went to their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the
goodness that the LORD had shown to David His servant and to Israel His
people.” (1 Kings 8:66, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then on the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the
people to their tents, rejoicing and happy of heart because of the goodness
that the LORD had shown to David and to Solomon and to His people Israel.” (2
Chronicles 7:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Haman went out that day glad and pleased of heart; but
when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate and that he did not stand up or
tremble before him, Haman was filled with anger against Mordecai.” (Esther 5:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Courage comes from <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the
heart. 1 Sam. 17:32</p>

<p class=Verses>“David said to Saul, &quot;Let no man's heart fail on account
of him; your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.&quot;” (1 Samuel
17:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A maturing right lobe results in a joyful heart. Prov.
17:22. </p>

<p class=Verses>“A joyful heart is good medicine, But a broken spirit dries up
the bones.” (Proverbs 17:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Bible doctrine in the right lobe results in a discerning
heart. 1 Kings 3:12; 1 Kings 3:9</p>

<p class=Verses>“behold, I have done according to your words. Behold, I have
given you a wise and discerning heart, so that there has been no one like you
before you, nor shall one like you arise after you.” (1 Kings 3:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;So give Your servant an understanding heart to judge
Your people to discern between good and evil. For who is able to judge this
great people of Yours?&quot;” (1 Kings 3:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Negative Capacities</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Lack of <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the right lobe
of the soul produces the wrong kind of sorrow, depression, discouragement, and
cowardice. All are associated with emotional revolt of the soul. Neh. 2:2; Lev.
26:16; Psalms 34:18; Num. 32:7; Joshua 14:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So the king said to me, &quot;Why is your face sad though you
are not sick? This is nothing but sadness of heart.&quot; Then I was very much
afraid.” (Nehemiah 2:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“I, in turn, will do this to you: I will appoint over you a
sudden terror, consumption and fever that will waste away the eyes and cause
the soul to pine away; also, you will sow your seed uselessly, for your enemies
will eat it up.” (Leviticus 26:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD is near to the brokenhearted And saves those who are
crushed in spirit.” (Psalms 34:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Now why are you discouraging the sons of Israel from
crossing over into the land which the LORD has given them?” (Numbers 32:7,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Nevertheless my brethren who went up with me made the
heart of the people melt with fear; but I followed the LORD my God fully.”
(Joshua 14:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The heart becomes an area of cursing due to lack of Bible
doctrine. Lam. 3:65; Deut. 28:47-48.</p>

<p class=Verses>“You will give them hardness of heart, Your curse will be on
them.” (Lamentations 3:65, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Because you did not serve the LORD your God with joy and
a glad heart, for the abundance of all things; therefore you shall serve your
enemies whom the LORD will send against you, in hunger, in thirst, in
nakedness, and in the lack of all things; and He will put an iron yoke on your
neck until He has destroyed you.” (Deuteronomy 28:47-48, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What is in the heart can be related to psychosis. Isaiah
13:7-8 describes a national psychotic condition.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore all hands will fall limp, And every man's heart will
melt. They will be terrified, Pains and anguish will take hold of them; They
will writhe like a woman in labor, They will look at one another in
astonishment, Their faces aflame.” (Isaiah 13:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mental attitude sins are related to the heart. Psalms
66:18; Psalms 101:5; Prov. 6:18; Matt. 12:35.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If I regard wickedness in my heart, The Lord will not hear;”
(Psalms 66:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Whoever secretly slanders his neighbor, him I will destroy; No
one who has a haughty look and an arrogant heart will I endure.” (Psalms 101:5,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“A heart that devises wicked plans, Feet that run rapidly to
evil,” (Proverbs 6:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;The good man brings out of his good treasure what is
good; and the evil man brings out of his evil treasure what is evil.” (Matthew
12:35, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Revenge is a function of the heart and starts with a
mental attitude sin, then it triggers the emotional revolt of the soul. Prov.
24:1-2; Ezek. 25:15-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do not be envious of evil men, Nor desire to be with them; For
their minds devise violence, And their lips talk of trouble.” (Proverbs 24:1-2,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“'Thus says the Lord GOD, &quot;Because the Philistines have
acted in revenge and have taken vengeance with scorn of soul to destroy with
everlasting enmity,&quot; therefore thus says the Lord GOD, &quot;Behold, I
will stretch out My hand against the Philistines, even cut off the Cherethites
and destroy the remnant of the seacoast. &quot;I will execute great vengeance
on them with wrathful rebukes; and they will know that I am the LORD when I lay
My vengeance on them.&quot;'&quot;” (Ezekiel 25:15-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When you despise someone, you despise them in your
thinking or your right lobe of the soul. 1 Chron. 15:29.</p>

<p class=Verses>“It happened when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to
the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out of the window
and saw King David leaping and celebrating; and she despised him in her heart.”
(1 Chronicles 15:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The deceitful heart is emotional revolt carried to the
maximum. Jer. 17:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;The heart is more deceitful than all else And is
desperately sick; Who can understand it?” (Jeremiah 17:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For the carnal and reversionistic believer, the scar
tissue in the soul provides capacity for sin, human good, evil, and production
of self-induced misery. 1 Sam 18:1; Psalms 6:3; Psalms 106:15; Psalms 119:28;
Psalms 119:81.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now it came about when he had finished speaking to Saul, that
the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as
himself.” (1 Samuel 18:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And my soul is greatly dismayed; But You, O LORD—how long?”
(Psalms 6:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So He gave them their request, But sent a wasting disease
among them.” (Psalms 106:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“My soul weeps because of grief; Strengthen me according to
Your word.” (Psalms 119:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Kaph. My soul languishes for Your salvation; I wait for Your
word.” (Psalms 119:81, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sins of the tongue reveal mental attitude sins. If you
are filled with guilt, arrogant, bitter, or full of revenge, you will talk a
certain way that reveals the content of your soul. The soul sponsors all overt
sins and sins of the tongue. Job 21:25; Zech. 11:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“While another dies with a bitter soul, Never even tasting
anything good.” (Job 21:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then I annihilated the three shepherds in one month, for my
soul was impatient with them, and their soul also was weary of me.” (Zechariah
11:8, NASB)</p>
