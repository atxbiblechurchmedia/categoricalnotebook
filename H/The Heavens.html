<h2>The Heavens</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are three heavens. If there is a “third” heaven,
there must be two others, a “first” and “second.” 2 Cor. 12:1-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Boasting is necessary, though it is not profitable; but I will
go on to visions and revelations of the Lord. I know a man in Christ who
fourteen years ago—whether in the body I do not know, or out of the body I do
not know, God knows—such a man was caught up to the third heaven. And I know
how such a man—whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know, God
knows—” (2 Corinthians 12:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first heaven is the atmosphere around us, up to 62
miles out. This is the officially determined limit to our atmosphere (Karman
line), but technically, the Exosphere extends to about 6,200 miles from the
earth’s surface according to NASA.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The second heaven is the abode of angels and includes the
galaxies’ stars and planets. The second heaven contains billions and billions
of light years of space with innumerable celestial bodies moving at rapid rates
of speed. One comes to this conclusion by a close study of star or stars which refer
to angels and the abode of angels. Isaiah 14:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But you said in your heart, 'I will ascend to heaven; I
will raise my throne above the stars of God, And I will sit on the mount of
assembly In the recesses of the north.” (Isaiah 14:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The third heaven is the presence of God – His throne
room. The third heaven is billions and billions of light years away. This is where
Jesus Christ is right now. Heb. 9:24. It is called the highest heavens in Deuteronomy
10:14 and 1 Kings 8:27. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For Christ did not enter a holy place made with hands, a mere
copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of
God for us;” (Hebrews 9:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Behold, to the LORD your God belong heaven and the
highest heavens, the earth and all that is in it.” (Deuteronomy 10:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold, heaven
and the highest heaven cannot contain You, how much less this house which I
have built!” (1 Kings 8:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Angels are also in the third heaven. At this time, Satan
has access into the third heaven where God the Father abides. Job 1 &amp; 2. He
will not have that access after the middle of the Tribulation. Compare Revelation
9:1 (“star” refers to Satan) with Revelation 12:3-4. “Stars of heaven” refers
to a third of the angels of heaven. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star from heaven
which had fallen to the earth; and the key of the bottomless pit was given to
him.” (Revelation 9:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then another sign appeared in heaven: and behold, a great red
dragon having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads were seven diadems.
And his tail swept away a third of the stars of heaven and threw them to the
earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so
that when she gave birth he might devour her child.” (Revelation 12:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan was the “anointed cherub” of highest rank who
guarded the Throne and when he fell, he influenced a third of the angels to
fall with him. Ezek. 28:14. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You were the anointed cherub who covers, And I placed
you there. You were on the holy mountain of God; You walked in the midst of the
stones of fire.” (Ezekiel 28:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Now Satan goes up to the throne room on those occasions
when the angels assemble. Other times he is in the second heaven or on earth.
He apparently commutes all over in fulfilling his rulership of the earth. Job
1-2; Zech. 3. See category on the <a href="#_Angelic_Conflict,_Satan’s">Angelic
Conflict, Satan's Strategies</a>. See category on <a
href="#_Angelic_Conflict,_Sequence">Angelic Conflict, Sequence of Major Events</a>.</p>
