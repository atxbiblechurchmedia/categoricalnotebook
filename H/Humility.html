<h2><a name="_D-Humility"></a><a name="_Humility"></a>Humility</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Humility is a divine characteristic to be found in the
human soul of the believer resulting from the intake and application of the
Word of God. It is a manifestation of spiritual growth. In 1 Peter 5:5, the
Greek word for “humility” is <span lang=EL>ταπεινοφροσυ</span>́<span lang=EL>νη</span>
(tapeinophrosunē) and means a mental attitude thought pattern of grace. Grace
thinking recognizes that we, at no time, earn or deserve any blessing from God.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;You younger men, likewise, be subject to your elders; and
all of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, for GOD IS
OPPOSED TO THE PROUD, BUT GIVES GRACE TO THE HUMBLE.&quot;  (1 Peter 5:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Humility understands that everything depends on who and
what God is and all He has done. Humility is not self-effacement (“Aw, shucks
that was nothing”) nor is it telling of your failures, telling jokes about
yourself to show how stupid you are.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Humility-grace thinking causes a believer to have no
illusion about themselves. Thus, the believer has an edification complex in
their soul instead of an inferiority complex or superiority complex. They have
a relaxed mental attitude.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mental attitude humility produces a relaxed mental
attitude toward believers that have authority over you. This mental attitude
grace enables the spiritual believer to submit to the teaching authority of
another believer in order to learn Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Pride is the opposite of humility and always resents and
rejects the authority of the pastor-teacher. Thus, only true humility through
the enabling power of the Holy Spirit allows learning of Bible doctrine. This
process causes the believer to become spiritually self-sustaining.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A believer who has the correct biblical concept of
humility in their soul is a wonderful believer to be around because of the
evident relaxed manner, dogmatic position without being arrogant, confidence in
their beliefs, and is never double-minded.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The word “gentleness” is found in Galatians 5:23 as one
of the fruits of the Spirit and is closely related to the meaning of humility.
It is also a mental attitude of not being pushy, self-centered, or demanding.
It is not a word denoting weakness. Moses was called humble in Numbers 12:3 and
was very much a man, not a mouse. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no
law.&quot;  (Galatians 5:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;(Now the man Moses was very humble, more than any man who
was on the face of the earth.)&quot;  (Numbers 12:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Dr. L.S. Chafer said on page 190, Volume 7 of his Doctrinal
Summarization that: “Since man has no merit in himself before God but receives
all that he has, humility is only the right and natural attitude. Christ was
humble, still not because He was a sinner or meritless. To become conscious of
humility its utter ruin.” </p>
