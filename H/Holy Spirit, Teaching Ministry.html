<h2><a name="_Holy_Spirit,_Grieving"></a>Holy Spirit, Teaching Ministry </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The indwelling of the Holy Spirit is permanent. The power
resident in every Church Age believer is potential and depends on whether or
not you are filled with the Holy Spirit. John 14:16; Eph. 5:18. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another
Helper, that He may be with you forever;” (John 14:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but
be filled with the Spirit,” (Ephesians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Bible is the means of knowing what God has said for
mankind and how to fulfill His plan for each and every believer. The Bible is
the mind of Christ in printed form. 1 Cor. 2:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT
HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.” (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Holy Spirit enables you to learn the Word when filled
with the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit also brings all things to your
remembrance. You can only remember the Bible doctrine which you have learned
and believed. John 14:26.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will
send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance
all that I said to you.” (John 14:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Holy Spirit teaches the human spirit. 1 Cor. 2:10-16;
Rom. 8:16. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For to us God revealed them through the Spirit; for the Spirit
searches all things, even the depths of God. For who among men knows the
thoughts of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so the
thoughts of God no one knows except the Spirit of God.” (1 Corinthians 2:10-11,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the
Spirit who is from God, so that we may know the things freely given to us by
God, which things we also speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in
those taught by the Spirit, combining spiritual thoughts with spiritual words.”
(1 Corinthians 2:12-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are
children of God,” (Romans 8:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We receive divine guidance through the teaching of the
Holy Spirit. John 16:13-14. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide
you into all the truth; for He will not speak on His own initiative, but
whatever He hears, He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come.
&quot;He will glorify Me, for He will take of Mine and will disclose it to
you.” (John 16:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To know the will of God (divine guidance), we must know
the Word of God. 2 Tim. 2:15; 2 Tim. 3:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman
who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth.” (2
Timothy 2:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching,
for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness;” (2 Timothy 3:16,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Timothy 3:16, as a result of the teaching of the
Holy Spirit to our human spirit, “profitable for teaching” is categories of
Bible doctrine. “For reproof” shows when and where we sin from the <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine already in our soul. “For correction” refers to divine
discipline to remind the believer to confess their known sins to God the Father
using 1 John 1:9. This is the correction for sin, resulting in cleansing and
the filling of the Holy Spirit. “For training in righteousness” is Positional
and Experiential Sanctification. The believer is to grow spiritually to renew
their thinking to line up more and more with the thinking of Jesus Christ. Rom.
12:2. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/S/Sanctification.html">Sanctification</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by
the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that
which is good and acceptable and perfect.” (Romans 12:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Isaiah 28:13 says we learn the Word of God “order on
order, order on order” which refers to Bible doctrine categories. “Line on line,
line on line” means verse by verse. “A little here, a little there” means some
every day. The Holy Spirit cannot teach the believer unless they expose
themselves to the teaching of Bible doctrine from a pastor-teacher and are
filled with the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So the word of the LORD to them will be, &quot;Order on order,
order on order, Line on line, line on line, A little here, a little
there,&quot; That they may go and stumble backward, be broken, snared and taken
captive.” (Isaiah 28:13, NASB)</p>
