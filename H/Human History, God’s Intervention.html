<h2>Human History, God’s Intervention</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mankind has made many advances in science, medical
technology and techniques, communications, military technology, industry, etc.
How far will mankind advance? Some say there is no limit. The Scriptures give
the answer.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s plan will unfold in exactly the manner that He
planned in eternity past. His perfect plan will fulfill its purpose. Volition
or free will is the key. God in His sovereignty agreed to provide free will to
all of His creatures. God never coerces free will. Ever. Even so, His plan will
unfold as He decreed without forcing or coercing anyone’s free will. See the
category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/G/The%20Plan%20of%20God.html">The Plan of God</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Garden of Eden after Adam and Eve had sinned, Jesus
Christ asked, “Adam, Where are you?” Where are you geographically? No! Where
are you spiritually! Adam and Eve were in a state of sin and had hidden
themselves. They could have no fellowship with God. Gen. 3:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD God called to the man, and said to him,
&quot;Where are you?&quot;” (Genesis 3:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord then made the first pronouncement of salvation
for mankind called the “Proto Evangel” in Genesis 3:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And I will put enmity Between you and the woman, And between
your seed and her seed; He shall bruise you on the head, And you shall bruise
him on the heel.&quot;” (Genesis 3:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Many years later, certain fallen angels came to the earth
to take human women as their wives. In so doing, the plan of Satan was to
corrupt the DNA of mankind and thus prevent the arrival of the perfect human
and perfect God on one person – the God-man, Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God made an announcement that this genetically corrupted
angelic-mankind mix would only last for 120 more years due to their violence
and corrupt angel-human natures. The wickedness of man was great. Gen. 6:3; Gen
6:5. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD said, &quot;My Spirit shall not strive with man
forever, because he also is flesh; nevertheless his days shall be one hundred
and twenty years.&quot;” (Genesis 6:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great on the
earth, and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil
continually.” (Genesis 6:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The thoughts of man’s heart were only evil. Mankind was
filled with violence and was corrupt. There remained no humans free of angelic
DNA except for eight – the family of Noah. Noah’s family also were the only
remaining believers on earth. God would intervene in human history with a great
flood. Gen. 6:11-12; Gen. 6:17. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/F/The%20Great%20Flood.html">The
Great Flood</a>. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Now the earth was corrupt in the sight of God, and the earth
was filled with violence. God looked on the earth, and behold, it was corrupt;
for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth.” (Genesis 6:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Behold, I, even I am bringing the flood of water upon
the earth, to destroy all flesh in which is the breath of life, from under
heaven; everything that is on the earth shall perish.” (Genesis 6:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Human history moved on to the Tower of Babel. Then, God
confounded their communication system into multiple languages. Gen. 11:4; Gen.
11:6-7; Gen. 11:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“They said, &quot;Come, let us build for ourselves a city, and
a tower whose top will reach into heaven, and let us make for ourselves a name,
otherwise we will be scattered abroad over the face of the whole earth.&quot;”
(Genesis 11:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD said, &quot;Behold, they are one people, and they all
have the same language. And this is what they began to do, and now nothing
which they purpose to do will be impossible for them. &quot;Come, let Us go
down and there confuse their language, so that they will not understand one
another's speech.&quot;” (Genesis 11:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the LORD
confused the language of the whole earth; and from there the LORD scattered
them abroad over the face of the whole earth.” (Genesis 11:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Old Testament continued to unfold and then one day a baby
was born - a God-man born to die. God intervenes in human history. Jesus Christ
became the center of attraction. Luke 2:11. </p>

<p class=Verses>“for today in the city of David there has been born for you a
Savior, who is Christ the Lord.” (Luke 2:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Then one day, God allowed an angel to make an
announcement of our Lord’s resurrection to those gathering at His tomb. Luke
24:5-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and as the women were terrified and bowed their faces to the
ground, the men said to them, &quot;Why do you seek the living One among the
dead? &quot;He is not here, but He has risen. Remember how He spoke to you
while He was still in Galilee,” (Luke 24:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The conclusion is that God indeed intervenes in human
history to further His plan. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Christian should ponder, and rightly so, how far will
man penetrate space? How far will space travel progress? As far as God permits.
Can man land on other planets? If God permits it. But God restrains. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Where are the eyes of the world today? On what man can
achieve? On how far man can travel in space? On what technical wonders man will
come up with? Their eyes should be on their need for the Savior – the Lord
Jesus Christ.</p>
