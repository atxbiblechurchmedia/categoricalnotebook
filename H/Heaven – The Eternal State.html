<h2>Heaven – The Eternal State</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Three Designations</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The eternal state will have three designations, the New
Heaven, the New Earth, and the New Jerusalem. Rev. 21:1-2; Rev. 21:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven
and the first earth passed away, and there is no longer any sea. And I saw the
holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, made ready as a
bride adorned for her husband.” (Revelation 21:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high
mountain, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven
from God,” (Revelation 21:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The eternal New Heaven will replace the old heavens which
will be burned with fire. 2 Peter 3:10; 2 Peter 3:13. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, in which the
heavens will pass away with a roar and the elements will be destroyed with
intense heat, and the earth and its works will be burned up.” (2 Peter 3:10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But according to His promise we are looking for new heavens
and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells.” (2 Peter 3:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The New Heaven will be residence of all Church Age
believers, although the New Jerusalem will play an important part in our
eternal home. The reason is that Jesus Christ will headquarter there and we as
Church Age believers are the Bride of Christ. The New Heaven will be constructed
out of innumerable light years of space. The expanse will be fantastic in
regard to “light.” There is a tremendous emphasis on light in eternity.
Characteristics which apply to the eternal state will apply to heaven. 2 Peter
3:13; Rev. 21; Rev. 22.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The eternal New Earth will replace the present earth.
This is the result of the eternal, literal promises of the Abrahamic and
Palestinian Covenants. The literal Land was promised to Abraham and his seed
forever. Rev. 21:1; 2 Peter 3:13; Gen. 17:8. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven
and the first earth passed away, and there is no longer any sea.” (Revelation
21:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But according to His promise we are looking for new heavens
and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells.” (2 Peter 3:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I will give to you and to your descendants after you,
the land of your sojournings, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting
possession; and I will be their God.&quot;” (Genesis 17:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some things can be learned about the New Earth from the
Millennial earth, however the New Earth will be much more than the Millennial
earth. This, on the basis of the unconditional covenants to Israel, will be the
eternal residence of the Old Testament saints, Tribulational saints, and
Millennial saints. All believers except Church Age believers.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The eternal New Jerusalem will fulfill three separate
functions. It will be headquarters for the universe in eternity as described in
Revelation 21:9-27. Note especially Revelation 21:24. </p>

<p class=Verses>“The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth
will bring their glory into it.” (Revelation 21:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It will be the personal residence of the Lord Jesus
Christ. The Bride of Christ (Church Age believers) will be there on occasion.
It will also fulfill a promise made to Abraham still outstanding. Abraham lived
in a tent, died in a tent, and was promised a city in the future. It also
illustrates something of the glory of eternity. Look at the description of its
beauty in Revelation 21. Rev. 21:22; Heb. 11:9-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God the Almighty and the
Lamb are its temple.” (Revelation 21:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“By faith he lived as an alien in the land of promise, as in a
foreign land, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow heirs of the same
promise; for he was looking for the city which has foundations, whose architect
and builder is God.” (Hebrews 11:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Three Characteristics</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Lord Jesus Christ will be personally present. “The tabernacle
of God” refers to the Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ will be accessible to all.
Rev. 21:3; Rev. 21:22. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And I heard a loud voice from the throne, saying,
&quot;Behold, the tabernacle of God is among men, and He will dwell among them,
and they shall be His people, and God Himself will be among them,” (Revelation
21:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God the Almighty and the
Lamb are its temple.” (Revelation 21:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Since the tabernacle was beautiful and Jesus Christ dwelt
in the tabernacle in the past as the Shekinah Glory, He will be in His glory
and will not have the humiliation associated in the past with the Cross. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Revelation 21:23 indicates that Jesus Christ (the Lamb)
has a resurrection body full of light. Our resurrection bodies will also
contain light. Persons will not be recognized on the basis of light being
refracted or reflected, but on the basis of having light inside. This is the concept
of the tabernacle.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the city has no need of the sun or of the moon to shine on
it, for the glory of God has illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb.”
(Revelation 21:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There will be perfect happiness in eternity. In Revelation
21:4, “He will wipe away every tear” refers to tears that come from pressure
and sorrow, not happy tears. Four things are removed - death, sorrow, crying,
and pain. “There will no longer be any death” refers to death as often the
focal point of human fears, which is associated with pain and painful death. “No
longer be any mourning” is mental agony or pain. “Or crying” is the
manifestation of pain. “Or pain” is physical pain. “Have passed away” is in the
aorist tense and refers to a point of time.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there
will no longer be any death; there will no longer be any mourning, or crying,
or pain; the first things have passed away.&quot;” (Revelation 21:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There will be perfect and perpetual newness in eternity. “Behold,
I am making all things new” means perceptually new that never gets old. “Write,
for these words are faithful and true” refers to God's veracity and
immutability that guarantee the glories of the eternal future. There will be no
corruption and no sin in eternity. Rev. 21:5; Rev. 21:27.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He who sits on the throne said, &quot;Behold, I am making
all things new.&quot; And He said, &quot;Write, for these words are faithful
and true.&quot;” (Revelation 21:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and nothing unclean, and no one who practices abomination and
lying, shall ever come into it, but only those whose names are written in the
Lamb's book of life.” (Revelation 21:27, NASB)</p>
