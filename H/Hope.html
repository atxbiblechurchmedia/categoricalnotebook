<h2><a name="_The_Human_Spirit"></a>Hope </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Hope means to desire with expectation of obtainment or
fulfillment, to trust or to have confidence that something will occur. The hope
of Israel today is of their coming Messiah and His Second Advent that will
usher in His kingdom on earth plus the New Earth of eternity. Luke 1:54; Luke
1:67-79; Acts 26:6-7; Acts 28:20; Eph. 2:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;He has given help to Israel His servant, In remembrance
of His mercy,” (Luke 1:54, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;And now I am standing trial for the hope of the promise
made by God to our fathers; the promise to which our twelve tribes hope to
attain, as they earnestly serve God night and day. And for this hope, O King, I
am being accused by Jews.” (Acts 26:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For this reason, therefore, I requested to see you and
to speak with you, for I am wearing this chain for the sake of the hope of
Israel.&quot;” (Acts 28:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“remember that you were at that time separate from Christ,
excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of
promise, having no hope and without God in the world.” (Ephesians 2:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Abrahamic Covenant as amplified by the Palestinic,
Davidic and New Covenant promised Israel land (Canaan), seed (Messiah), and
blessing (being born-again). The Messiah would have an eternal throne. Israel’s
hope lay in the promises of God. See category on the <a
href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/C/Covenants%20to%20Israel.html">Covenants to Israel</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Abraham was promised a city (the New Jerusalem). Abraham
though quite wealthy was a tent dweller. His hope was vested in the this
promise mentioned in Hebrews 11:9-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“By faith he lived as an alien in the land of promise, as in a
foreign land, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow heirs of the same
promise; for he was looking for the city which has foundations, whose architect
and builder is God.” (Hebrews 11:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The hope for the Church is centered on the “blessed hope”
of the Rapture, the return of Christ to bring home the Body or Christ (all
Church Age believers). Titus 2:13-15; 1 John 3:2-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of
our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus, who gave Himself for us to redeem us
from every lawless deed, and to purify for Himself a people for His own
possession, zealous for good deeds. These things speak and exhort and reprove
with all authority. Let no one disregard you.” (Titus 2:13-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Beloved, now we are children of God, and it has not appeared
as yet what we will be. We know that when He appears, we will be like Him,
because we will see Him just as He is. And everyone who has this hope fixed on
Him purifies himself, just as He is pure.” (1 John 3:2-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Word of God indicates that the believer’s strength in
this life on earth depends upon the believer’s hope or confidence concerning
eternity. 1 John 3:3. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And everyone who has this hope fixed on Him purifies himself,
just as He is pure.” (1 John 3:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Hope is the mental attitude that results from application
of Bible doctrine such as eternal inheritance, our new home yet future, and receiving
our resurrection body at the Rapture of the Church. 1 Peter 1:4-5; John 14:1-3;
1 Cor. 15:51-57; 1 Thess. 4:16-18; Phil. 3:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“to obtain an inheritance which is imperishable and undefiled
and will not fade away, reserved in heaven for you, who are protected by the
power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last
time.” (1 Peter 1:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Do not let your heart be troubled; believe in God,
believe also in Me. &quot;In My Father's house are many dwelling places; if it
were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you.
&quot;If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to
Myself, that where I am, there you may be also.” (John 14:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout,
with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in
Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up
together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we shall
always be with the Lord. Therefore comfort one another with these words.” (1
Thessalonians 4:16-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“who will transform the body of our humble state into
conformity with the body of His glory, by the exertion of the power that He has
even to subject all things to Himself.” (Philippians 3:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Hope is derived from passages such as Revelation 21:4,
which states that there will be no more tears, death, or pain in heaven.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there
will no longer be any death; there will no longer be any mourning, or crying,
or pain; the first things have passed away.&quot;” (Revelation 21:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Hope is closely related to encouragement. It is
tremendous to know that an appointment with the Great White Throne Judgment has
been cancelled when we believe in Jesus Christ. Heb. 9:27-28. See category on
the <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/G/Great%20White%20Throne%20Judgment.html">Great White Throne Judgment</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once and after
this comes judgment, so Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins
of many, will appear a second time for salvation without reference to sin, to
those who eagerly await Him.” (Hebrews 9:27-28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Hope is also closely related to confidence. When we use
the grace apparatus for perception, we grow in grace and the knowledge of our
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. When the believer is oriented to the plan of God
in eternity, they orient to the plan of God in their time on earth.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Because of the hope we have in Christ, death has lost its
sting and the grave its victory. Thus, the word “hopeless” should not even be
in the vocabulary of a believer. 1 Cor. 15:54-58.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But when this perishable will have put on the imperishable,
and this mortal will have put on immortality, then will come about the saying
that is written, &quot;DEATH IS SWALLOWED UP in victory. &quot;O DEATH, WHERE
IS YOUR VICTORY? O DEATH, WHERE IS YOUR STING?&quot; The sting of death is sin,
and the power of sin is the law; but thanks be to God, who gives us the victory
through our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast,
immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your toil is
not in vain in the Lord.” (1 Corinthians 15:54-58, NASB)</p>
