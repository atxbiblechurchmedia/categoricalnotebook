<h2>Human Viewpoint</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Human viewpoint is a thought process or pattern used in
the approach to a certain detail with emphasis on the origin of it, the method
of it and the end of it. Human viewpoint is the term used to describe a certain
mental attitude originating in the old sin nature which serves you as a method
of approach to handling a situation that you are faced with. This mental
attitude is a procedure of thought leading to a resultant conclusion. All such
mental attitude processes which the Bible outlines as spiritually wrong are
classified as human viewpoint.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Sources of Human Viewpoint Tests</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Exposure to the human viewpoint of others has an
influence on you. For example, Abraham was influenced by the human viewpoint of
others. Human viewpoint may arise out of a trend or lust pattern of the old sin
nature.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Expressions of human viewpoint seem to always involve
certain general patterns. These patterns involve changing tactics, for example,
where the enemies of Nehemiah caused changes in rebuilding the walls of
Jerusalem. These patterns also involve changing goals such as the mad pursuit
of happiness in the book of Ecclesiastes. These patterns also involve the
elimination of obstacles.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are reasons why human viewpoint is embraced rather
than divine viewpoint. It may seem the most logical course of action. It may
seem to be the most secure thing to do. It may seem to be the most pleasurable
thing to do. It may seem to be the most profitable thing to do. It may seem to
be the most doctrinally accurate if you have a limited frame of reference. It
may be classified by other believers whom you respect, as divine viewpoint.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>How may human viewpoint serve you? It may get you out of
a temporary jam like going to a loan shark for a loan. It may take other
people’s eyes off you temporarily just as politicians do to divert attention
from their failures. It may make you look great in the eyes of people like a
promotion in business. It may remove you from the field of suspicion just like David
did by scrabbling on the walls of the city of Gath, pretending insanity. It may
set up favorable future conditions like laws being passed with lasting effects
on the business world and your pursuits. It may reduce someone else to what
they really are and spare the people affected from being taken in by them.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Tests of Human Viewpoint</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Accomplishment Test</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is a problem of pride. In 1 Timothy 3:6, “new
convert” is <span lang=EL>νεο</span>́<span lang=EL>φυτος</span> (neophutos) and
means a new believer, a new convert, a neophyte or one who has recently become
a Christian. “Conceited” is the aorist passive participle of <span lang=EL>τυφο</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (tuphoō) and means to be puffed up with pride, haughty. “Condemnation”
is <span lang=EL>κρι</span>́<span lang=EL>μα</span> (krima) and means condemnation
of wrong, the decision (whether severe or mild) where one passes on the faults
of others.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and not a new convert, so that he will not become conceited
and fall into the condemnation incurred by the devil.” (1 Timothy 3:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Timothy 3:7, deacons or overseers in the local
church are the subject and must have certain qualities evident to those outside
the local church who are thinking with human viewpoint. They must not fall into
“reproach” which is <span lang=EL>ο</span>̓<span lang=EL>νειδισμο</span>́<span
lang=EL>ς</span> (oneidismos) and “the snare of the devil” is παγίς (pagis)
and means a trap, or snare, the allurement to sin by which the devil holds one
bound. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And he must have a good reputation with those outside the
church, so that he will not fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.” (1
Timothy 3:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 22:15, our Lord is being tested by the human
viewpoint of the Pharisees. “How they might trap Him” is <span lang=EL>παγιδευ</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (pagideuō) and means the attempt to get a remark from someone
which can be turned into an accusation against him. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the Pharisees went and plotted together how they might
trap Him in what He said.” (Matthew 22:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Titus 2:2, “sensible” is <span lang=EL>σω</span>́<span
lang=EL>φρων</span> (sōphrōn) and means to curb one’s desires and impulses,
to have a proper and moderate evaluation of yourself, to be self-controlled, to
be temperate.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Older men are to be temperate, dignified, sensible, sound in
faith, in love, in perseverance. Older women likewise are to be reverent in
their behavior, not malicious gossips nor enslaved to much wine, teaching what
is good,” (Titus 2:2-3, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“Likewise urge the young men to be sensible; in all things show
yourself to be an example of good deeds, with purity in doctrine, dignified,
sound in speech which is beyond reproach, so that the opponent will be put to
shame, having nothing bad to say about us.” (Titus 2:6-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 12:3, “not to think more highly of himself than
he ought to think” is <span lang=EL>υ</span>̔<span lang=EL>περφρονεω</span>́
(huperphroneō) and means to think more highly of one’s self than is proper.
“Sound judgment” is the opposite and is <span lang=EL>σωφρονε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (sōphroneō) and means to be of sound mind, to exercise
self-control, to put a moderate estimate upon one’s self, think of one’s self
soberly, to curb one’s passions. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For through the grace given to me I say to everyone among you
not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think; but to think so as
to have sound judgment, as God has allotted to each a measure of faith.”
(Romans 12:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Examples of the accomplishment test are Nebuchadnezzar
and Belshazzar. Nebuchadnezzar had pride as a result of knowing of his national
greatness in Daniel 3. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, the height of
which was sixty cubits and its width six cubits; he set it up on the plain of
Dura in the province of Babylon.” (Daniel 3:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Daniel 5, Belshazzar had pride as a result of
greatness by association.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;O king, the Most High God granted sovereignty, grandeur,
glory and majesty to Nebuchadnezzar your father.” (Daniel 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But when his heart was lifted up and his spirit became
so proud that he behaved arrogantly, he was deposed from his royal throne and
his glory was taken away from him.” (Daniel 5:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Yet you, his son, Belshazzar, have not humbled your
heart, even though you knew all this,” (Daniel 5:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Human Viewpoint Related to Success and Accomplishment</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first point of human viewpoint relating to
accomplishment or success is the practice of doing your job half-way. Yes, do finish
the thing, but not first class. Secondly, human viewpoint distorts true
accomplishment or success, by getting the person too concerned about the pride
problem so he never attempts the thing. Thirdly, human viewpoint gets the
accomplishment or success when it occurs out of a true perspective as to its
source. The person may think that they are successful because of personality, or
methods, or systems and not because of grace.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Human viewpoint finds its way into the self-esteem or
self-evaluation of the person. Rom. 12:3; Titus 2:2-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For through the grace given to me I say to everyone among you
not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think; but to think so as
to have sound judgment, as God has allotted to each a measure of faith.”
(Romans 12:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Older men are to be temperate, dignified, sensible, sound in
faith, in love, in perseverance. Older women likewise are to be reverent in
their behavior, not malicious gossips nor enslaved to much wine, teaching what
is good,” (Titus 2:2-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is the over extension principle. Human viewpoint from
pride is one of the devil’s tools to knock the pastor-teacher out of the
ministry. The successful pastor may become enamored with what people think of him
in the ministry. Human viewpoint pride may originate out of a very true
condition of excellence. The pastor-teacher may really be what he claims to be.
Therefore, legitimate success may be the source of pride. The nation of Babylon
was truly a great nation even in the eyes of God, the head of gold. 1 Tim. 3; Dan.
3; Dan. 5.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>How can one reconcile or balance the concept of
excellence, proper humility and yet not produce human viewpoint pride? The
basic answer is growth through Bible doctrine. The answer for the novice believer
is to get out of the baby stage. That is particularly true for the adolescent
believer. Growing to spiritual maturity is the answer.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Geographical Test</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is probably one of the most common tests in Satan’s
arsenal to defeat the babe and adolescent believer. The occasion for this test
may come in many ways. Geographical tests involve the temptation to solve a
problem in the human way by the use of geographical possibilities. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Geographical tests involve changing your geographical
location based on human viewpoint. This is changing your geographical location
because of a bad economic condition. For example, in Genesis 12, Abram changed
his geographical location from Canaan to Egypt to get away from a famine. In Luke
15:12-13, the prodigal son changed geographical location to enhance physical
pleasures and to pursue more possessions.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;The younger of them said to his father, 'Father, give me
the share of the estate that falls to me.' So he divided his wealth between
them. &quot;And not many days later, the younger son gathered everything
together and went on a journey into a distant country, and there he squandered
his estate with loose living.” (Luke 15:12-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Geographical tests involve changing your geographical
location because of its apparent prosperity. Here, you are choosing your
geographical location on the basis that getting there will solve all your
problems. In Genesis 13:10, Lot chose what appeared outwardly (human viewpoint)
to be a very prosperous area at the time - the area of Sodom and Gomorrah. In Deuteronomy
28-30, the nation of Israel failed to follow God's commandments and instead
followed their human viewpoint apart from God's guidance.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Lot lifted up his eyes and saw all the valley of the Jordan,
that it was well watered everywhere—this was before the LORD destroyed Sodom
and Gomorrah—like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt as you go to
Zoar.” (Genesis 13:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Geographical tests involve changing your geographical
location because it will enable you to unify with someone else. Where there is
unity there is strength. This is the wrong use of the “united we stand, divided
we fall” principle. In Genesis 11, we have the Tower of Babel incident. “Let’s
locate in one spot and preserve one another. Let’s move near a stable relative
or a stable pastor and he will keep us in line.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Geographical tests also involve choosing your
geographical location from the standpoint of getting away from the immediate
source of confrontation with God. Psalms 139.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The human viewpoint geographical test can involve evaluating
a prospective geographical location from the standpoint of the obstacles
attached to it. With human viewpoint, you are falsely interpreting your
geographical conditions. You are feeling sorry for yourself because of the
conditions of your present geographical location. Num. 13; Num. 21:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The people spoke against God and Moses, &quot;Why have you
brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and
no water, and we loathe this miserable food.&quot;” (Numbers 21:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The human viewpoint geographical test can involve falsely
applying the principle of the Great Commission. The idea that it is more
spiritual to go to a far off place to serve the Lord than a close one. Matt.
28:19-20. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations,
baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit,
teaching them to observe all that I commanded you; and lo, I am with you
always, even to the end of the age.&quot;” (Matthew 28:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The human viewpoint geographical test can involve disregarding
the warnings of the Spirit of God as to your geographical exposure. You may
choose to extend your stay in a geographical location when it’s time to move
on. The geographical test may involve falsely evaluating your former
geographical location as better than the present one. Acts 21; Matt. 24; Exodus
16:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The sons of Israel said to them, &quot;Would that we had died
by the LORD'S hand in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the pots of meat, when
we ate bread to the full; for you have brought us out into this wilderness to
kill this whole assembly with hunger.&quot;” (Exodus 16:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Divine Viewpoint of Geographical Location Principles</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Temporary geographical displacement was used as divine discipline.
Gen. 15:13; Lev. 26; Deut. 28-30. Blessing in your right geographical location
is dependent on your obedience to Bible doctrine and resultant spiritual growth
and not just automatic with your presence there. Deut. 28-29. In getting into
your right geographical location, there are many new obstacles often to
overcome. Joshua 1-3; Joshua 3:4. A definite change of geographical location
can be divine viewpoint. Gen. 12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“God said to Abram, &quot;Know for certain that your
descendants will be strangers in a land that is not theirs, where they will be
enslaved and oppressed four hundred years.” (Genesis 15:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;However, there shall be between you and it a distance of
about 2,000 cubits by measure. Do not come near it, that you may know the way
by which you shall go, for you have not passed this way before.&quot;” (Joshua
3:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The principle of geographical location and divine
viewpoint is related to the three stages of spiritual growth. This is seen in
the illustration of the nation of Israel in the Old Testament. Abraham’s call
through the Egyptian bondage was the babe stage of the national spiritual growth.
There were many geographical changes. From the Exodus to Canaan, Israel as an
adolescent nation. There was much wandering that was very detrimental. For Israel
in Canaan,  Israel as a spiritually mature nation. They knew that God had fixed
their location in the Land of Promise, with anything outside of the Land considered
a source of divine discipline.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Blessing for the spiritually mature is directly related
to functioning in the proper geographical location. It is to be a permanent,
consistent, stable type of life, not flitting here and there and yon. To
recognize the characteristics of certain levels of spiritual growth relating to
your geographical location, is not necessarily to advocate them. In other
words, just because Israel in adolescence had a wandering geography is not to
say this is the way you should go.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Human Viewpoint Foolishness </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Human intelligence assigns foolishness to God.
Rationalism and empiricism always discredit God or the Word in one way or
another. Thus, human perspicacity can only blaspheme God by assigning to Him
words like “foolishness” or <span lang=EL>μωρο</span>́<span lang=EL>ς</span>
(mōros). God appears foolish to human viewpoint. That is why human intelligence
or human IQ assigns foolishness to God.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the
weakness of God is stronger than men.” (1 Corinthians 1:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is why Paul picked up the unbeliever’s word to make
a sarcastic comparative - sanctified sarcasm. God and the plan of God are
perfect. Man and his plans are imperfect and sinful. Man distorts truth by
contending God is foolish. Paul reverses the distortion by stating the absolute.
The foolishness that man assigns to God is wiser than the wisest of men. Greeks
in their rationalism regarded the Cross as foolishness, but the foolishness of
God is wiser than the genius of man.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Weakness” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>σθενη</span>́<span
lang=EL>ς</span> (asthenēs) in the Greek and means feeble, without energy,
power or human strength. This is the blasphemous assumption of theological
empiricism where Jews wanted miracles from God and a system of works from men.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God didn’t meet the demands of their scarred souls,
causing the Jews to assign the characteristic of weakness to God. They assigned
to Him weakness from their frame of reference and human IQ. They regarded the
Cross as a sign of weakness because Jesus Christ didn’t come down. Such human
viewpoint and conclusion of human IQ is empiricism.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s plan of grace demanded that Jesus Christ stay on
the Cross and be judged for the sins of the world. Human viewpoint empiricism
demanded that He come off the Cross. Therefore, the phrase used by Paul is a
common phrase ascribed to the fact that Jesus Christ didn’t obey the Jews. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Human Viewpoint Examples and Analysis</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Gen 16:7: Sarai and Hagar, when facing an apparent human
impossibility, the practice of turning to an alternate human solution instead
of waiting on God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Exodus 17: When the going gets tough or unpleasant, the
practice of getting down on your leader.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Num 13: When faced with opportunity, seeing only the
difficulties of the task involved.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Joshua 7: When measuring effects or results of a thing,
the practice of minimizing the effects in proportion to the number involved. This
is the insignificance of the individual concept, “Oh, I’m only one person.” An
example was the sin of Achan.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Joshua 13, Judges 1: When given a sphere of
responsibility, the practice of being satisfied with only a partial fulfillment
of the responsibility.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 Samuel 4: When involved in the work of God, the
practice of using a spiritual thing as a “good luck charm.” Going to church to
help your business, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 Samuel 8: When surrounded by certain life styles of
others, the practice of desiring to be like them.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 Samuel 13: When caught in a definite disobedience to
God’s will, the practice of rationalizing to get around it.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 Samuel 15: When in leadership and faced with the
pressure of your followers, the practice of catering to their whims rather than
to proper instructions of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 Samuel 17: When in embarrassing positions, the practice
of ridicule of others to bolster your own sagging face.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 Samuel 24: When given the opportunity to afflict a
personal enemy, the practice of taking the opportunity, disregarding the office
or rank of the person. This is the “evil for evil principle.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>2 Samuel 7: When in success, the practice of showing
great concern for God who gave you that success, then feeling sorry for God and
forgetting from whence you came.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>2 Sam. 11: When faced with some desired object, the
practice of utilizing any and all means to arrive at the desired end. For example,
Saul using the office of Samuel.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Nehemiah 4: When faced with a job, the practice of
dismissing it as “too hopeless to ever accomplish anyway.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Esther 3: When desirous of selfish ends, the practice of
appealing to the wellbeing or sense of decency of an influential person to set
up a condition to bring your ends to pass.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Job: When others suffer, the practice of ascribing to
them some sinful cause for that suffering.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Proverbs 10: When facing opportunity or crises in an area
of finances, the practice of wrongly applying the concept of faith. Oh, yes,
God will provide, so the hands are folded and the believer sits back slothfully
to wait.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Proverbs 27: When facing the uncertain future, having the
attitude that I will do this or that, failing to recognize the principle of uncertainty
in which we live.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ecclesiastes: When faced with the need of happiness or
satisfaction from life, the practice of experimentation exploited to the
maximum. Education will stand me in good stead, but it won’t. Pleasure will
stand me in good stead, but it won’t. Possession will stand me in good stead,
but it won’t. Money will stand me in good stead, but it won’t. Reputation will
stand me in good stead, but it won’t. Sex will stand me in good stead, but it
won’t. Achievement will stand me in good stead, but it won’t. Being carefree
will stand me in good stead, but it won’t.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Matthew 19:27: Human viewpoint is seen here as the
conviction that since you gave up so much then logically, God owes you

views on a matter.</p>

of God in evaluating your life, the practice of denying any weakness, any

An example was Stephen’s stoning.</p>

Sorcerer.</p>

better my case and results will be. An example was the Jews stirring up the
Gentiles against Paul and Barnabas. The practice of holding a person in great
admiration when they accomplish a certain spiritual feat, but reversing the
field when they say or do something contrary to your likes or fancies. An example
was Paul’s ministry in the healing of the crippled man. Getting your eyes on
the man.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Acts 15: The attempt to give a new quality to an old
inadequacy and therefore include it in a new context. For example, the question
of making circumcision required for salvation. Also, the equivalent of making tithing
a requirement for spirituality.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Acts 16: The attempt to increase favorability by making
concessions. An example was Timothy being circumcised because of his Greek

man is universally moral because man is universally in God. Man is a
logos-being, parallel to today’s fatherhood of God, brotherhood of man idea. An

scholarship, the practice of being open minded to all forms of potential truth,
desiring to give everything an equal and careful hearing.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Acts 19: The concept that one can use the name of the
Lord Jesus as a magical formula to accomplish a certain feat. An example was
