<h2>Hair As a Covering</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Corinthian church, hair was the legalistic focus
in the local assembly. While women did not have hats in the ancient world, they
did have veils. And no lady was properly dressed for street attire unless she
had a veil covering her head. There were many types of veils in the ancient
world.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Two types of women were not permitted to wear veils -
prostitutes and slaves. When either of these two types walked into the local
church with long hair and no veil, it caused the legalists to get upset. They
wanted to throw these ladies out because they were not wearing veils. They were
not following the custom of the day. They were very critical of those who were
positive to Bible doctrine. Paul began by teaching three basic principles of
authority.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Objective of the Apostle Paul </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In l Corinthians 11:3, “But I want” is the present active
indicative of θέλω (thelō) and denotes purpose or intention. He is saying in
effect, “I intend, literally.” It is used here for censure. “To understand” is
the perfect active infinitive of οἶδα (oida) and is a past perfect form used
as a present tense. In other words, there is something that must be
straightened out in the Corinthian congregation.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But I want you to understand that Christ is the head of every
man, and the man is the head of a woman, and God is the head of Christ.” (1
Corinthians 11:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Christ is the head” is <span lang=EL>κεφαλη</span>́
(kephalē) and refers to the head on the body, the residence for the soul and
human spirit, but it also means superior rank and authority. “Every man” is <span
lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>νη</span>́<span lang=EL>ρ</span> (anēr) and
refers to a noble man, a saved man. The present active indicative of <span
lang=EL>ειμί</span> means that Christ keeps on being the head of every man. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“The man is the head of a woman” refers to the husband’s
higher authority in the marriage relationship. There is no verb used, which is
great emphasis in the Greek. Authority in the church leads to authority in
marriage. “God is the head of Christ” is referring to Christ in hypostatic
union. “God” refers to God the Father. God the Father had the authority and the
rank during the incarnation of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Pattern for Men Praying </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 11:4, “Every man” is <span lang=EL>πα</span>͂<span
lang=EL>ς</span><span lang=EL> </span><span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>νη</span>́<span
lang=EL>ρ</span> (pas anēr) and means every male believer, nobleman, praying
or prophesying in contrast to the next verse where you have the female. “Who
has” is the present active participle of <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓́<span lang=EL>χω</span>
(echō) and is meant to get a dramatic continuity going. “Has something on his
head” is <span lang=EL>κατά</span> plus <span lang=EL>κεφαλη</span>́ (kephalē)
and is a figurative use referring to the literal head.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Praying” is the present active participle of <span
lang=EL>προσευ</span>́<span lang=EL>χομαι</span> (proseuchomai) which is an
intensive prayer and a public prayer that is part of a worship service. “Prophesying”
is the present active participle of <span lang=EL>προφητευ</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span><span lang=EL> </span>(prophēteuō) and means to prophesy, to
be a prophet, to speak forth by divine inspirations, to predict. Both of these
are assembly functions in context. However, since the canon of Scripture is
completed, this is limited today to the teaching of prophetical passages by an
authorized communicator. “Disgraces his head” is the present active indicative
of <span lang=EL>καταισχυ</span>́<span lang=EL>νω</span> (kataischunō) and means
to disgrace. He keeps on disgracing his head (his authority). He keeps on dishonoring
Jesus Christ. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Every man who has something on his head while praying or
prophesying disgraces his head.” (1 Corinthians 11:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What is this saying? In idiom form, it is speaking of
long hair. Long hair dishonors a man. This is strictly a dissertation on hair
length until we get to a parentheses and then it becomes a dissertation on the husband-wife
relationship in marriage.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A man’s badge as head of his home is his short hair. Hair
style on a man is strictly a matter of what he thinks. The long hair craze is
not a fashion expression, but is indicative of an animal mentality. A good illustration
of a man who reeked authority was Otto Von Bismarck who formed the German
empire in 1870. He was a genius of history.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If a man puts on a hat in a church service, he is
covering up his authority. If he has long hair, it does the same thing. He
actually becomes cut loose from his authority. Instinctively, a man wants short
hair if he is a man (believer or unbeliever). To the unbeliever - “does not
even nature itself teach you” and to the believer “does not even doctrine teach
you?” 1 Cor. 11:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long
hair, it is a dishonor to him,” (1 Corinthians 11:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A man who has long hair because a lady told him he looked
good is obviously a responder in his soul. He is a woman in his soul. A man
would say, “You need to get used to me this way, honey, because this is the way
it is going to be!”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>About 70 years ago, there was discovered in the catacombs
of Rome a picture of believers meeting in the early church and all the men had
short hair. The caption said, “Christians in Assembly.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>So, when is hair too long in a male? If you comb it
straight forward and it comes over the eyes or nose or mouth, it is too long. The
hair has become a veil!  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Pattern for Women Praying </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 11:5, “every woman” <span lang=EL>πα</span>͂<span
lang=EL>ς</span><span lang=EL> </span><span lang=EL>γυνη</span>́ (pas gunē)
and refers to a woman of any age, whether a virgin, or married, or a widow. “Praying”
is the present middle participle of <span lang=EL>προσευ</span>́<span lang=EL>χομαι</span>
(proseuchomai). “Prophesying” is the present active participle of <span
lang=EL>προφητευ</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (prophēteuō). “Has her head
uncovered” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>κατακα</span>́<span lang=EL>λυπτος</span>
(akatakaluptos) and refers to something hidden and down. This is a veil.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul is setting this up to catch the legalists who were
criticizing the women for coming in without a veil. He didn’t define the veil
as being long hair until the end of the chapter, but they are nodding their
heads now--yes, Paul, yes, Paul you are right, etc.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But every woman who has her head uncovered while praying or
prophesying disgraces her head, for she is one and the same as the woman whose
head is shaved.” (1 Corinthians 11:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 11:5, Paul was saying, “A woman should
never go without her covering.” The legalists really liked the sound of that. “Disgraces
her head” is the present active indicative of <span lang=EL>καταισχυ</span>́<span
lang=EL>νω</span> (kataischunō) and means to put to shame, to disgrace, to humiliate.
Paul does a lot of repeating and he does that to get the legalists nodding. Paul
then says, “Why it’s the same as if her head were shaved.” The legalists liked
the sound of that even more. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>The perfect passive participle of
<span lang=EL>ξυρε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (xureō) means to shave with a
razor. The perfect tense means she has been shaved and will continue to remain
shaved. The passive voice means she was shaved by someone else. No woman of her
own volition ever shaves her hair. The participle means the reality of being
permanently shaved.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Shaving the head was the punishment for prostitutes in
the ancient world. They had rejected the concept of sex in marriage only and so
they lost their glory. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If a female slave ran away the first time, her hair was
shaved. If she ran away the second time, her body was branded. If her hair was
shaved, she could wear a hat, a veil, but you discredit your head if you have
long hair and a hat.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Wait until Paul gets to verse 15 where he says her veil
is her hair! The legalists definitely do not like the sound of that. The long
hair of a woman is her glory. Her hair is designed differently. She has the
green light to comb it, to brush it, to trim it, and to keep it attractive. Her
long hair is an illustration of divine design. It is a sign of submission to
God and to her husband. How does she dishonor her head? When she fails to
recognize God’s grace provision of rapport love and becomes negative to the
teaching of Bible doctrine. The real issue here is not veils or hats, but Bible
doctrine!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Customs and Traditions of the Times, Their
Relationship to the Local Church </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 11:6, “For if” is a first class
condition and means “if and it is true.” “A woman does not cover her head” is <span
lang=EL>κατακαλυ</span>́<span lang=EL>πτω</span> (katakaluptō) and means to
cover up, to veil or cover one’s self. Paul is using sanctified sarcasm here
for emphasis.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Let her also have her hair cut off” is the aorist middle
imperative of <span lang=EL>κει</span>́<span lang=EL>ρω</span> (keirō) and
means to sheer as you would a sheep, to get or let be shorn, shearing or
cutting short the hair of the head. Paul is saying she is uncovered only when she
has been shorn. The legalists were saying that a woman is uncovered if she does
not wear a cloth type veil.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For if a woman does not cover her head, let her also have her
hair cut off; but if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or
her head shaved, let her cover her head.” (1 Corinthians 11:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“But if it is disgraceful” is a first class condition
meaning it is truly disgraceful. Paul is using reverse sarcasm here again for
emphasis in making his point. “Shaved” is the present passive infinitive of <span
lang=EL>ξυρα</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span><span lang=EL> </span>(xuraō) and
means shave it all off, to cut off hair with a sharp instrument. “Let her cover
her head” is again <span lang=EL>κατακαλυ</span>́<span lang=EL>πτω</span>
(katakaluptō) and means to cover up, to veil or cover one’s self. To the
legalist this is a hat. To the Apostle Paul this is long hair. Her hair is her
hat. Paul is saying, “But if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut
off or shaved, let her be covered.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A translation of 1 Corinthians 11:6 is, “For if a woman
does not veil herself, shave her. But if it is disgraceful for a woman to have
her hair cut off or shaved, keep on veiling her. Paul has the legalists all
nodding at this point.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Application </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 11:7, “For a man ought not” is the present
active indicative of <span lang=EL>ο</span>̓<span lang=EL>φει</span>́<span
lang=EL>λω</span> (opheilō) plus the negative <span lang=EL>ουκ</span> (ouk)
and is a very strong negative. “To have his head covered” is <span lang=EL>κατακαλυ</span>́<span
lang=EL>πτω</span> (katakaluptō) and means to hide, to cover up, to veil or
cover one’s self. This means that a man should never have long hair that would
constitute a veil. A man’s hair should never cover his face! </p>

<p class=Verses>“For a man ought not to have his head covered, since he is the
image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man.” (1 Corinthians
11:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Since he is” is the present active participle of <span
lang=EL>υ</span>̔<span lang=EL>πα</span>́<span lang=EL>ρχω</span><span lang=EL>
</span>(huparchō) and means to be, to exist. ”The image and glory of God” refers
to the image which is the soul essence. Glory means that even though the man
has an old sin nature, he can still glorify God in his regenerate state through
Bible doctrine. Glory here refers to the edification complex of the soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“But the woman is the glory of the man” is the present
active indicative of <span lang=EL>ειμί</span> and means that she keeps on
being under the authority of the man and is the glory of the man. This refers
to the man’s edification complex of the soul. Also, he has found the right
woman for him and her indication of that fact is her long hair. “Glory”
indicates the woman as a responder to the man.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>There are only two reasons for a
man having short hair - because he has recognized the authority of God and because
he has recognized that God has given him leadership authority over his wife in
marriage.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Appeal to Common Sense For the Female</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 11:13, “Judge” is the aorist active
imperative of <span lang=EL>κρι</span>́<span lang=EL>νω</span> (krinō) and
does not mean to judge at all, but to have discernment and apply common sense
to the situation. “For yourselves” the preposition <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span
lang=EL>ν</span> (en) plus the instrumental of the reflexive pronoun means to
discern by means of yourselves.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Judge for yourselves: is it proper for a woman to pray to God
with her head uncovered?” (1 Corinthians 11:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Constantive aorist of <i>krinō</i> means it is a matter
of continual discernment that there is a difference between male and female.
The active voice means that you have to discern for yourself. The imperative
mood is a command. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In discernment, you recognize the context and go from
there. Discernment comes from <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the soul. A
maximum amount of Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the soul and a maximum
amount of common sense are completely compatible.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A man’s short hair is his badge of authority and that he has
leadership authority over his wife in marriage. A woman’s long hair is her
badge of recognizing the man’s authority and her acknowledgment before God that
she has been provided in His grace the right man for her. The husband fulfills his
wife and she completes him. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Is it proper” is the present active indicative of <span
lang=EL>ει</span>̓<span lang=EL>μι</span>́ (eimi) and means does it keep on
being proper. “Proper” is the impersonal verb <span lang=EL>πρε</span>́<span
lang=EL>πω</span> (prepō) and means fitting or proper. “To pray” is the present
middle infinitive of <span lang=EL>προσευ</span>́<span lang=EL>χομαι</span>
(proseuchomai) and means intensive prayer. “Uncovered” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span
lang=EL>κατακα</span>́<span lang=EL>λυπτος</span><span lang=EL> </span>(akatakaluptos)
and means not covered, unveiled. A cover is something that hangs down so that
it hides the face such as long hair.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A translation of 1 Corinthians 11:13 is, “Discern by
means of yourselves, is it proper for a woman to pray not having long hair?</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If a woman prays with short hair, it is a sign that she
has already rejected God’s order and design. Normally this means unveiled, but
here it means not having long hair. Common sense tells you that if a woman with
a boy cut walks in and a long haired male walks in, can they impress God with
their prayers. No. They are already in rebellion.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are two basic ways whereby there can be basic
recognition of authority in the marriage. Bible doctrine is now in writing, so that
makes it easy. Short hair on the man and long hair on the woman is a
recognition of this gift from Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Both common sense and propriety demand longer hair on a
woman no matter what she is doing. Her hair is the woman’s glory. This is her
recognition that God provides is grace and that He will provide the right kind
of man for her. This is her submission to God’s authority while she waits for
God to bring the right kind of man designed for her. If she does not recognize
God’s authority, she will never recognize the authority of the right kind of
man.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are some men who are either unbelievers or negative
to Bible doctrine who are a bit intolerant of allowing their wives to come to
Bible class. In doing so, they buck the tiger. What they are doing is
destroying their own authority in the marriage.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Appeal to Common Sense For the Male </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 11:14, “Does not even” is <span lang=EL>ου</span>̓<span
lang=EL>δε</span>́ (oude) and expects a positive answer. “Nature” is <span
lang=EL>φυ</span>́<span lang=EL>σις</span><span lang=EL> </span>(phusis) and
means the nature of things, natural laws, the order of nature and refers to God’s
laws in the natural realm. It means common sense teaches you instinctively that
a woman with long hair looks like a woman and a man with short hair looks like
a man. There is a difference between a man and woman. A man is not beautiful,
pretty, or sweet. He can be as ugly as hell. A woman is beautiful, cute,
pretty, and sweet. She is as pretty as heaven. The man was never designed to be
beautiful!  If he is an animal, he may try to be beautiful because he is
feminine in his soul.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long
hair, it is a dishonor to him,” (1 Corinthians 11:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The principle here is that common sense and propriety
demand that a woman have long hair, no matter what she is doing. “Teach you” is
the present active indicative of <span lang=EL>διδα</span>́<span lang=EL>σκω</span>
(didaskō) and means to teach a group. Nature teaches a group. Does not nature
communicate to all of you?</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“If a man” is a third class condition of <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span
lang=EL>α</span>́<span lang=EL>ν</span> (ean) plus the subjunctive mood in the
verb. This recognizes the fact that a man could let his hair grow long. “Has
long hair” is one verb in the Greek, the present active subjunctive of <span
lang=EL>κομα</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (komaō) and means to wear long
hair, rather than have it.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A translation of 1 Corinthians 11:14 is, “Does not nature
itself communicate to all of you that if a man keeps on wearing long hair, it
is always (in the history of the human race, present active indicative of <i>eimi</i>)
being a disgrace or dishonor to him.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is dishonorable because the man is wearing the woman’s
badge of submission. Long hair on a man is not the fashion. It is a sign of the
condition of the soul with scar tissue, emotional revolt, and reversionism. It
is a rebellion against the grace gift of woman and God’s design for him!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Conclusions Regarding Hair </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 11:15, “but if” is a third class
condition and means that when a man chooses to wear long hair, it is a disgrace
to him, but when a woman wears long hair, it is her honor. “A woman has long
hair” is the present active subjunctive of <span lang=EL>κομα</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (komaō) and recognizes that all through history it was
possible for women to have long hair. “It is a glory to her” is the dative of
advantage of <span lang=EL>δο</span>́<span lang=EL>ξα</span> (doxa) and means
it keeps on being a glory to her, but on the man it is a disgrace. </p>

<p class=Verses>“but if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her? For her
hair is given to her for a covering.” (1 Corinthians 11:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“For her hair” is <span lang=EL>κο</span>́<span lang=EL>μη</span>
(komē) and means her head of long hair is something glorious and beautiful. “Is
given” is the perfect passive indicative of <span lang=EL>δι</span>́<span
lang=EL>δωμι</span> (didōmi) and means to give something to someone of one’s
own accord that is to their advantage, to bestow a gift. The three gifts to man
are his right kind of woman, salvation, and Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The perfect tense means it has been given and refers to the
permanence of the principle in that it never changes. From the Garden to the
end of the Millennium, a woman’s long hair is just as much a sign as a rainbow
in the sky, but for different things. The passive voice means the woman
receives this sign from God in grace, even as she receives the right kind of man
for her.  The indicative mood refers to the reality of doctrine and means the
hair is the reality of the sign.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“For a covering” involves a preposition which is
mistranslated. The Greek word <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>ντι</span>́
(anti) means “instead of” not “for.” Covering is <span lang=EL>περιβο</span>́<span
lang=EL>λαιον</span> (peribolaion) and means for her hair has been given her
instead of a veil or hat or bonnet or anything a woman may put on her head. Her
hair is her covering.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A translation of 1 Corinthians 11:15 is, “But if a woman
wears long hair, it keeps on being a glory to her because her hair has been
given to her instead of a covering (veil, hat, etc.).”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 11:16, “But if one” is a first class
condition and refers to the reality of the situation for a male or female. “Is
inclined” is the present active indicative of <span lang=EL>δοκε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (dokeō) and means to presume. It is presumption for a woman
to wear short hair and a man to wear long hair. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But if one is inclined to be contentious, we have no other
practice, nor have the churches of God.” (1 Corinthians 11:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Contentious” is <span lang=EL>φιλο</span>́<span lang=EL>νεικος</span>
(philoneikos) and means a love of contention. It is used for those who have
scar tissue of the soul, emotional revolt of the soul, reversionism,
anti-establishment thinking, rejection of authority and no self-discipline. “We
have no other practice” or custom as this where a person has to wear a hat in a
church. It is not found in Corinth and even in the other churches, “nor have
the churches of God.”</p>
