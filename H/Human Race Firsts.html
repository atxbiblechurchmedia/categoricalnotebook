<h2>Human Race Firsts</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first test of human volition was one tree. God tested
man’s volition. Negative volition was the only way man could sin in innocence. Gen.
2:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Out of the ground the LORD God caused to grow every tree that
is pleasing to the sight and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst
of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis
2:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first warning was that physical death would be an end
result of spiritual death. Gen. 2:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall
not eat, for in the day that you eat from it you will surely die.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis
2:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first temptation of man was where Satan appealed to
Eve’s ego and maligned God. Gen. 3:1-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field
which the LORD God had made. And he said to the woman, “Indeed, has God said, ‘You
shall not eat from any tree of the garden’?” The woman said to the serpent, “From
the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat; but from the fruit of the tree
which is in the middle of the garden, God has said, ‘You shall not eat from it
or touch it, or you will die.’“ The serpent said to the woman, “You surely will
not die! “For God knows that in the day you eat from it your eyes will be
opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis
3:1-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first sin was the sin of negative volition. Both Adam
and Eve were guilty, but there was a difference. Eve was deceived. Adam
deliberately sinned. Gen. 3:6; 1 Tim. 1:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that
it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one wise,
she took from its fruit and ate; and she gave also to her husband with her, and
he ate.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis 3:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and the grace of our Lord was more than abundant, with the
faith and love which are found in Christ Jesus.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Timothy 1:14,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first result of the first sin was when Adam died
spiritually (no fellowship with God). He immediately possessed only relative
righteousness (-R) and could not have fellowship with God who can only have
fellowship with perfect absolute righteousness (+R).  Adam acquired a sin
nature from his sin. Because he first sinned, we all sinned and genetically
acquire an old sin nature from our father. Gen. 3:7-8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that
they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loin
coverings. They heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in the
cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of
the LORD God among the trees of the garden.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis 3:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first act of legalism was man attempting to solve man’s
problems by their own works. Adam and Eve sewed fig leaves together. They were
frightened because they had become separated them from God because of their
sin. Gen. 3:7; Isaiah 59:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that
they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loin
coverings.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis 3:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But your iniquities have made a separation between you and
your God, And your sins have hidden His face from you so that He does not hear.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah
59:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first act of grace was when God spoke to them first.
He called to Adam who was head of the human race. God in His omniscience knew
where Adam was and didn’t need to call. Gen. 3:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD God called to the man, and said to him, “Where
are you?”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis 3:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first declaration of salvation was that Jesus Christ
would be the seed or descendent of the woman. Gen. 3:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And I will put enmity Between you and the woman, And between
your seed and her seed; He shall bruise you on the head, And you shall bruise
him on the heel.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis 3:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>The first salvation for the human
race was when God made coats of skin for Adam and Eve. God did all the work.
The coats of skin were obtained by the shedding of blood. Heb. 9:22; 1 Peter
1:18-19. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And according to the Law, one may almost say, all things are
cleansed with blood, and without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews
9:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable things like
silver or gold from your futile way of life inherited from your forefathers,
but with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and spotless, the blood of
Christ.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Peter 1:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>They were both spiritually dead
and could have no fellowship with perfect God. God clothing them was a picture
of salvation to come from their positive volition toward the Savior to come.
Clothing them is a picture of receiving the imputation of God’s very own
perfect righteousness (+R) at the point of faith alone in Christ. Isaiah 61:10;
Gen. 3:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I will rejoice greatly in the LORD, My soul will exult in my
God; For He has clothed me with garments of salvation, He has wrapped me with a
robe of righteousness, As a bridegroom decks himself with a garland, And as a
bride adorns herself with her jewels.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah 61:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife, and
clothed them.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis 3:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first issue was human good versus divine good. This
is coats of skin given in grace from God versus fig leaves made by man by their
own means.</p>
