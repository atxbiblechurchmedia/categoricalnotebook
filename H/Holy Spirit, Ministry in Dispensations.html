<h2><a name="_Holy_Spirit,_Ministry"></a>Holy Spirit, Ministry in Dispensations</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In each of the four major dispensations (the Age of the
Gentiles, the Age of the Jews, the Church Age, and the Millennium), the Holy
Spirit convinces of sin, righteousness and judgment. He helps communicate the
Gospel to unbelievers. The Holy Spirit is responsible for regeneration in each
of the four dispensations. Salvation is always the same. 1 Cor. 2:14. See
category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/D/Dispensations.html">Dispensations</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Prior to the creation of mankind, the Holy Spirit was
involved in the restoration of the earth following the fall of Satan and his
angels. In creation, the Father planned or designed. 1 Cor. 8:6; Psalms 102:25.</p>

<p class=Verses>“yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom are all
things and we exist for Him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom are all
things, and we exist through Him.” (1 Corinthians 8:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Of old You founded the earth, And the heavens are the
work of Your hands.” (Psalms 102:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In creation, God the Son did the creating. Eph. 3:9; Col.
1:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and to bring to light what is the administration of the
mystery which for ages has been hidden in God who created all things;”
(Ephesians 3:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For by Him all things were created, both in the heavens and on
earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or
authorities—all things have been created through Him and for Him.” (Colossians
1:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In creation, the Holy Spirit restored the original
creation of the earth after it was destroyed by Satan. Psalms 104:30; Gen. 1:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“You send forth Your Spirit, they are created; And You renew
the face of the ground.” (Psalms 104:30, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“The earth was formless and void, and darkness was over the
surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was moving over the surface of the
waters.” (Genesis 1:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>After creation, the Holy Spirit did not leave the world,
but continued to reveal God’s will to men, inspire the prophets to write
Scripture, and work miracles through the prophets and preachers.  2 Peter 1:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men
moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.” (2 Peter 1:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Age of the Gentiles and the Age of the Jews</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Age of the Gentiles and the Age of the Jews, the
Holy Spirit empowered specific people for specified jobs. The Holy Spirit gave
some people special understanding and wisdom. They became great leaders of
God’s people, such as some of the judges. They revealed God’s word as writers
of the Old Testament.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Holy Spirit gave some special skills or unusual
physical strength for use in God’s service such as workers on the tabernacle
and Samson. The Holy Spirit was then removed because either their work was
finished, or because of sin.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It was not God’s purpose to fill or live in every
believer in the Old Testament. God chose to give certain believers the Holy
Spirit for His purposes. The Holy Spirit empowered some believers in the Old
Testament, but not all. It was not their qualification, but was God’s sovereign
decision. It is not who and what they were, but who and what God is. Psalms
135:6. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Whatever the LORD pleases, He does, In heaven and in earth, in
the seas and in all deeps.” (Psalms 135:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Holy Spirit was with all believers because He is
omnipresent, but the Holy Spirit was not in them to empower all believers. In
Old Testament times, one could ask for the Holy Spirit and receive Him under
special conditions. For example, Elisha’s request was granted in 2 Kings 2:9
and 2 Kings 2:15. </p>

<p class=Verses>“When they had crossed over, Elijah said to Elisha, &quot;Ask
what I shall do for you before I am taken from you.&quot; And Elisha said,
&quot;Please, let a double portion of your spirit be upon me.&quot;” (2 Kings
2:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now when the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho opposite
him saw him, they said, &quot;The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.&quot; And
they came to meet him and bowed themselves to the ground before him.” (2 Kings
2:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Father is the one who sent the Holy Spirit on these
special missions. Matt. 10:20. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For it is not you who speak, but it is the Spirit of
your Father who speaks in you.” (Matthew 10:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Age of the Gentiles and the Age of the Jews, spirituality
was actually the operation of the faith-rest life. John 7:39. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But this He spoke of the Spirit, whom those who believed in
Him were to receive; for the Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not
yet glorified.” (John 7:39, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The universal indwelling of the Holy Spirit was not given
in the Age of the Gentiles and the Age of the Jews because Christ had not yet gone
to the Cross and been glorified. The universal filling of the Spirit also was
not given in the Age of the Gentiles and the Age of the Jews. The Holy Spirit
indwelt or endued only certain Old Testament believers to perform special
functions. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers could be disciplined in the Old Testament by
the removal of the Holy Spirit. David prayed, “do not take Your Holy Spirit
from me.” This prayer was a result of sin in his life. The Holy Spirit was
removed from Saul as divine discipline because of sin. Psalms 51:11; 1 Sam.
16:14. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Do not cast me away from Your presence And do not take Your
Holy Spirit from me.” (Psalms 51:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil
spirit from the LORD terrorized him.” (1 Samuel 16:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There were three occasions in the Old Testament where the
Holy Spirit had a ministry with a carnal believer. They were Balaam in Numbers
24:2, Samson in Judges 13:25, Judges 14:6, and Judges 15:14, and King Saul in 1
Samuel 19:23-24. Today in the Church Age, sin in the life prevents the filling
of the Holy Spirit, but His indwelling of the believer’s body remains permanent.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And Balaam lifted up his eyes and saw Israel camping tribe by
tribe; and the Spirit of God came upon him.” (Numbers 24:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“When he came to Lehi, the Philistines shouted as they met him.
And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him mightily so that the ropes that were
on his arms were as flax that is burned with fire, and his bonds dropped from
his hands.” (Judges 15:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He proceeded there to Naioth in Ramah; and the Spirit of God
came upon him also, so that he went along prophesying continually until he came
to Naioth in Ramah. He also stripped off his clothes, and he too prophesied
before Samuel and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Therefore
they say, &quot;Is Saul also among the prophets?&quot;” (1 Samuel 19:23-24,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Those Empowered in the Old Testament</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Joseph was the first believer mentioned as being
empowered. He was empowered with the Holy Spirit for the purpose of
administration of the land of Egypt to preserve a nation from starvation during
a famine. The Holy Spirit controlled the life of Joseph. Gen. 41:38.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Pharaoh said to his servants, &quot;Can we find a man
like this, in whom is a divine spirit?&quot;” (Genesis 41:38, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Workers on the tabernacle, Bezalel and Oholiab, were
given special wisdom and ability through the power of the Holy Spirit. Exodus
35:30-35.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Moses said to the sons of Israel, &quot;See, the LORD has
called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.
&quot;And He has filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding
and in knowledge and in all craftsmanship;” (Exodus 35:30-31, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;He also has put in his heart to teach, both he and
Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. &quot;He has filled them
with skill to perform every work of an engraver and of a designer and of an
embroiderer, in blue and in purple and in scarlet material, and in fine linen,
and of a weaver, as performers of every work and makers of designs.” (Exodus
35:34-35, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Workers were empowered by the Holy Spirit when working on
Aaron’s garments in Exodus 28:3 and priestly garments in Exodus 31:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You shall speak to all the skillful persons whom I have
endowed with the spirit of wisdom, that they make Aaron's garments to
consecrate him, that he may minister as priest to Me.” (Exodus 28:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I have filled him with the Spirit of God in wisdom, in
understanding, in knowledge, and in all kinds of craftsmanship,” (Exodus 31:3,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Moses and the 70 elders of Israel who helped him were
empowered by the Holy Spirit to lead the children of Israel out of Egypt. Num.
11:16-17; Num. 11:25. </p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD therefore said to Moses, &quot;Gather for Me seventy
men from the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people and
their officers and bring them to the tent of meeting, and let them take their
stand there with you. &quot;Then I will come down and speak with you there, and
I will take of the Spirit who is upon you, and will put Him upon them; and they
shall bear the burden of the people with you, so that you will not bear it all
alone.” (Numbers 11:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD came down in the cloud and spoke to him; and He
took of the Spirit who was upon him and placed Him upon the seventy elders. And
when the Spirit rested upon them, they prophesied. But they did not do it
again.” (Numbers 11:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Leaders of Israel were empowered by the Holy Spirit such
as Joshua in Numbers 27:18, Gideon in Judges 6:34, Jephthah in Judges 11:29,
Samson in Judges 13:24-25, Judges 14:6, and Judges 15:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So the LORD said to Moses, &quot;Take Joshua the son of Nun, a
man in whom is the Spirit, and lay your hand on him;” (Numbers 27:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon; and he blew a
trumpet, and the Abiezrites were called together to follow him.” (Judges 6:34,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, so that he
passed through Gilead and Manasseh; then he passed through Mizpah of Gilead,
and from Mizpah of Gilead he went on to the sons of Ammon.” (Judges 11:29,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The Spirit of the LORD came upon him mightily, so that he tore
him as one tears a young goat though he had nothing in his hand; but he did not
tell his father or mother what he had done.” (Judges 14:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“When he came to Lehi, the Philistines shouted as they met him.
And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him mightily so that the ropes that were
on his arms were as flax that is burned with fire, and his bonds dropped from
his hands.” (Judges 15:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>King Saul was empowered and controlled by the Spirit in 1
Samuel 10:9-10. Perhaps Saul could have been Israel’s greatest king, but
through sin and continued disobedience, the Holy Spirit left Saul. The Lord then
allowed mental illness. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then it happened when he turned his back to leave Samuel, God
changed his heart; and all those signs came about on that day. When they came
to the hill there, behold, a group of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God
came upon him mightily, so that he prophesied among them.” (1 Samuel 10:9-10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>David was empowered by the Holy Spirit in 1 Samuel 16:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst
of his brothers; and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon David from that
day forward. And Samuel arose and went to Ramah.” (1 Samuel 16:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The prophets were empowered - Elijah and Elisha in 1 and
2 Kings, Isaiah and Daniel in 2 Peter 1:21, Daniel 4:8, and Daniel 5:11-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men
moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.” (2 Peter 1:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But finally Daniel came in before me, whose name is
Belteshazzar according to the name of my god, and in whom is a spirit of the
holy gods; and I related the dream to him, saying,” (Daniel 4:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Zerubbabel was empowered by the Holy Spirit in Zechariah
4:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then he said to me, &quot;This is the word of the LORD to
Zerubbabel saying, 'Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,' says the LORD
of hosts.” (Zechariah 4:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is a great deal of difference between the
indwelling of the Spirit today and the ministry of the Holy Spirit in Old
Testament times. When Christ was on earth, the ministry of the Holy Spirit in
the Old Testament sense was still functioning. Jesus gave the Holy Spirit to
His disciples even though they didn’t ask. Our Lord breathing on them conveyed
unseen power. The conclusion is that Jesus Christ prayed for them that the
Father would send the Holy Spirit. John 20:22; John 14:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And when He had said this, He breathed on them and said to
them, &quot;Receive the Holy Spirit.” (John 20:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another
Helper, that He may be with you forever;” (John 14:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus gave the Holy Spirit to the disciples just before His
ascension. He left them for ten days with a new means of cohesiveness. John
20:22. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And when He had said this, He breathed on them and *said to
them, &quot;Receive the Holy Spirit.” (John 20:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Church Age</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The universal indwelling of the Holy Spirit is unique to
only two dispensations, the Church Age and the Millennium. Once the Church Age
began, every believer was indwelt by the Holy Spirit at the moment of
salvation. John 7:37-39; John 14:16-17; 1 Cor. 3:16; 1 Cor. 6:19-20; Rom. 8:9;
Gal. 3:2; Gal. 4:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood
and cried out, saying, &quot;If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and
drink. &quot;He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, 'From his innermost
being will flow rivers of living water.'&quot; But this He spoke of the Spirit,
whom those who believed in Him were to receive; for the Spirit was not yet
given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.” (John 7:37-39, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do you not know that you are a temple of God and that the
Spirit of God dwells in you?” (1 Corinthians 3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“However, you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed
the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if anyone does not have the Spirit of
Christ, he does not belong to Him.” (Romans 8:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son
into our hearts, crying, &quot;Abba! Father!&quot;” (Galatians 4:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Tribulation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Characteristics of the ministry of the Holy Spirit in the
Tribulation will be identical to that of the Age of the Jews because the
Tribulation is the last seven years of the Age of the Jews. It was specialized,
not universalized. John 7:39.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But this He spoke of the Spirit, whom those who believed in
Him were to receive; for the Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not
yet glorified.” (John 7:39, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Millennium</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers of all previous dispensations will be in
resurrection bodies in the Millennium with the exception of Tribulation
believers who are alive at the Second Advent of Jesus Christ and will go into
the Millennium in their physical bodies. These believers in physical bodies
will be indwelt by the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All believers in non-resurrection physical bodies will
have old sin natures. Physical birth from these believers who are indwelt by
the Holy Spirit will produce unbelievers with old sin natures. Therefore, they
must personally believe in Christ to be saved.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The old sin nature will be restrained in the Millennium
because the Lord Jesus Christ will be physically present and visible on earth.
Believers in resurrection bodies will be present and observing. Elect angels
will also be observing. The universal indwelling of the Holy Spirit will enable
maximum knowledge of Bible doctrine,  the very mind of Jesus Christ. 1 Cor.
2:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT
HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.” (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When Jesus Christ returns to the earth at the Second
Advent, all fallen angels will be removed from the earth, including Satan,
therefore there will be no religion. Because Christ will be on the earth and it
will not be necessary to produce the character of Christ, spirituality will become
a matter of ecstatics - an appreciation of the person of Christ as He lives and
reigns on the earth.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There will be great spirituality in the Millennium. The
Lord Jesus Christ will be present and there will be perfect environment. In Joel
2:28-29, “after this” refers to after the Second Advent. “My Spirit” is the
Holy Spirit. “On all mankind” refers to Tribulation believers alive at the Second
Advent in physical bodies. “Your sons and daughters will prophesy” refers to
the Old Testament manifestation of the Spirit’s control. “Even on the male and
female servants” refers to all believers in the Millennium who will be indwelt
by the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;It will come about after this That I will pour out My
Spirit on all mankind; And your sons and daughters will prophesy, Your old men
will dream dreams, Your young men will see visions. &quot;Even on the male and
female servants I will pour out My Spirit in those days.” (Joel 2:28-29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Isaiah 65:24 will be a prayer system of the Millennium.
All believers will be controlled by the Holy Spirit. Zechariah 14:16-17 refers
to the system of worship in the Millennium.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;It will also come to pass that before they call, I will
answer; and while they are still speaking, I will hear.” (Isaiah 65:24, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then it will come about that any who are left of all the
nations that went against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the
King, the LORD of hosts, and to celebrate the Feast of Booths. And it will be
that whichever of the families of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem to
worship the King, the LORD of hosts, there will be no rain on them.” (Zechariah
14:16-17, NASB)</p>
