<h2><a name="_Holy_Spirit,_Indwelling_1"></a>Holy Spirit, Indwelling </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Church Age, the permanent indwelling of the Holy
Spirit prepares a suitable residence in the body of every believer for the
permanent indwelling of Jesus Christ as the Shekinah Glory and for the
permanent indwelling of God the Father. This all occurs at the moment of
salvation. This makes the body of the believer the sanctuary or temple of God.
In the Old Testament, the sanctuary was the tabernacle in the tent in the
desert or the temple in Jerusalem. 1 Cor. 3:16-17; 1 Cor. 6:19-20.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Do you not know that you are a temple of God and that the
Spirit of God dwells in you? If any man destroys the temple of God, God will
destroy him, for the temple of God is holy, and that is what you are.&quot;  (1
Corinthians 3:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy
Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and that you are not your own?
For you have been bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your
body.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 6:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The indwelling of the Holy Spirit in every believer was
prophesied prior to the beginning of the Church Age by Jesus Christ. This was
impossible before Jesus Christ had ascended and was glorified. John 7:37-39;
John 14:16-17;, John 14:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus
stood and cried out, saying, &quot;If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and
drink. &quot;He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, 'From his innermost
being will flow rivers of living water.'&quot; But this He spoke of the Spirit,
whom those who believed in Him were to receive; for the Spirit was not yet
given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.&quot;  (John 7:37-39, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Helper,
that He may be with you forever; that is the Spirit of truth, whom the world
cannot receive, because it does not see Him or know Him, but you know Him
because He abides with you and will be in you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 14:16-17,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in
Me, and I in you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 14:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Church Age, from the Day of Pentecost to the
Rapture of the Church, the Holy Spirit permanently indwells every believer at
the moment of salvation. The indwelling of the Holy Spirit in the body of the
believer makes it impossible for demon possession to occur. 1 Cor. 12:13; Gal.
3:2; Gal. 4:6; Rom. 5:5; Rom. 8:8-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body,
whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink
of one Spirit.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 12:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;This is the only thing I want to find out from you: did
you receive the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by hearing with
faith?&quot;  (Galatians 3:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of
His Son into our hearts, crying, &quot;Abba! Father!&quot;&quot;  (Galatians
4:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has
been poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to
us.&quot;  (Romans 5:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and those who are in the flesh cannot please God.
However, you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of
God dwells in you. But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does
not belong to Him.&quot;  (Romans 8:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The indwelling Holy Spirit is the believer’s teacher and
mentor in the spiritual life. The Holy Spirit enables the believer to recall
applicable <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine from the right lobe of their soul
and to properly apply it to life’s situations and decisions. John 14:26.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will
send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance
all that I said to you.” (John 14:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Only when the believer is filled with the Holy Spirit, do
these teaching and application ministries function. This is part of God's grace
resources for the Church Age believer to fulfill the plan of God for their
lives here on earth and to thereby glorify the Lord Jesus Christ. John 16:13-15;
1 Cor. 2:9; 1 John 2:27; Eph. 5:18; Gal. 5:22-26.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will
guide you into all the truth; for He will not speak on His own initiative, but
whatever He hears, He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come.
&quot;He will glorify Me, for He will take of Mine and will disclose it to you.
&quot;All things that the Father has are Mine; therefore I said that He takes
of Mine and will disclose it to you. &quot;  (John 16:13-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;but just as it is written, &quot;THINGS WHICH EYE HAS NOT
SEEN AND EAR HAS NOT HEARD, AND which HAVE NOT ENTERED THE HEART OF MAN, ALL
THAT GOD HAS PREPARED FOR THOSE WHO LOVE HIM.&quot;&quot;  (1 Corinthians 2:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;As for you, the anointing which you received from Him
abides in you, and you have no need for anyone to teach you; but as His
anointing teaches you about all things, and is true and is not a lie, and just
as it has taught you, you abide in Him.&quot;  (1 John 2:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but
be filled with the Spirit,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience,
kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things
there is no law. Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh
with its passions and desires. If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by
the Spirit. Let us not become boastful, challenging one another, envying one
another.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Galatians 5:22-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Anointing is a synonym for the indwelling of the Holy
Spirit. Anointing relates the indwelling of the Holy Spirit to the Church Age
believer as a sign they are members of the Body of Christ. 1 John 2:20.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all
know.&quot;  (1 John 2:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The indwelling of the Holy Spirit is one of the permanent
ministries of the Holy Spirit at salvation. There are seven salvation
ministries of the Holy Spirit - six are permanent, one is temporary. See
category on <a href="#_D-Holy_Spirit,_Seven_1">Holy Spirit, Seven Salvation
Ministries</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Contrasting Indwelling and Filling of the Holy Spirit </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The indwelling of the Holy Spirit is permanent regardless
of whether the believer is in a state of spirituality or whether in a state of
carnality. The indwelling of the Holy Spirit cannot be lost. Sin will not
remove the indwelling Holy Spirit in the Church Age. It is as permanent as is
salvation. John 14:16-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;I will ask the Father, and He will give you
another Helper, that He may be with you forever; that is the Spirit of truth,
whom the world cannot receive, because it does not see Him or know Him, but you
know Him because He abides with you and will be in you. &quot;  (John 14:16-17,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The filling of the Holy Spirit is temporary and depends
on whether the believer chooses to sin or to confess their known sins to God
the Father using 1 John 1:9. When the believer has confessed their sins biblically,
they are guaranteed of the filling of the Holy Spirit. When we sin, we lose the
filling of the Holy Spirit, but not the indwelling of the Spirit. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&quot;  (1 John
1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When the believer is filled with the Holy Spirit and in
fellowship with God, their life is a letter of Christ written by the Holy
Spirit. 2 Cor. 3:3. See category on <a href="#_D-Filling_of_the_1">Filling of
the Holy Spirit</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“being manifested that you are a letter of Christ, cared for by
us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets
of stone but on tablets of human hearts.” (2 Corinthians 3:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The indwelling of the Holy Spirit emphasizes the
believer’s body. The filling of the Holy Spirit emphasizes the control of the
believer’s soul. When the sin nature takes over the believer’s soul, then the
believer sins.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Holy Spirit is God and God cannot control if there is
sin in the life. The Holy Spirit is the only one who can glorify Christ in the
Church Age. A relationship with Jesus Christ means a relationship with the Holy
Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Holy Spirit indwells the body of every Church Age
believer for the purpose of glorifying the Lord Jesus Christ. However,
indwelling alone does not guarantee glorification of Christ. It is potential.
When the believer is filled with the Holy Spirit, only then can Jesus Christ be
glorified through the production of divine good. This is accomplished by the
filling of the Holy Spirit whereby the believer can make use of God's grace
resources to understand spiritual truth, to glorify Christ by living the Christian
way of life, and to be a witness for Christ. John 16:13-14; 1 Cor. 2:12; 1 Cor.
6:20; Gal. 5:22; Acts 1:8; Eph. 5:18; Phil. 1:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide
you into all the truth; for He will not speak on His own initiative, but
whatever He hears, He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come.
&quot;He will glorify Me, for He will take of Mine and will disclose it to
you.” (John 16:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but
the Spirit who is from God, so that we may know the things freely given to us
by God,&quot;  (1 Corinthians 2:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For you have been bought with a price: therefore glorify
God in your body.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 6:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,
patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,&quot;  (Galatians 5:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come
upon you; and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and
Samaria, and even to the remotest part of the earth.&quot; &quot;  (Acts 1:8,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but
be filled with the Spirit,” (Ephesians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“according to my earnest expectation and hope, that I will not
be put to shame in anything, but that with all boldness, Christ will even now,
as always, be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death.” (Philippians
1:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There was no indwelling of the Holy Spirit in earlier
dispensations. Indwelling only occurs in the Church Age. No Tribulational or
Millennial believer will be indwelt with the Holy Spirit.   Believers in the
Old Testament were empowered by the Holy Spirit at certain times and was called
enduement. Psalms 51:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Do not cast me away from Your presence And do not take
Your Holy Spirit from me.&quot;  (Psalms 51:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The indwelling of the Holy Spirit is an absolute
regardless of whether the believer is in a state of carnality or in a state of
spirituality. All Church Age believers are indwelled by the Holy Spirit at
salvation. The filling of the Holy Spirit is also an absolute, but only occurs
when the believer’s soul is controlled by the Holy Spirit – in a state of
spirituality. </p>
