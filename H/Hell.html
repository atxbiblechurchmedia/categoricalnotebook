<h2>Hell</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The overall designation for the place of all departed
souls (believers and unbelievers) in the Old Testament is <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שׁאול</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(she'ôl). <i>Sheol</i> is the Hebrew word
for the lower parts of the earth and is translated “hell.” Hades <span lang=EL>α</span>̔́ͅ<span
lang=EL>δης</span> (hadēs) is the Greek word for the lower parts of the earth
and is also translated “hell.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Hell’s Compartments</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Old Testament, Sheol (hell) was made up of three compartments:
Tartarus, Torments, and Paradise. Tartarus is that compartment of hell where
the bound fallen angels are located. 2 Peter 2:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but
cast them into hell and committed them to pits of darkness, reserved for
judgment;&quot;  (2 Peter 2:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Torments is that compartment of hell where unbeliever’s
souls are awaiting the Last Judgment or the Great White Throne Judgment. Luke
16:23; Rev. 20:11-15.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;In Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torment,
and saw Abraham far away and Lazarus in his bosom. &quot;  (Luke 16:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat upon it,
from whose presence earth and heaven fled away, and no place was found for
them. And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne,
and books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life;
and the dead were judged from the things which were written in the books,
according to their deeds. And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and
death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged,
every one of them according to their deeds. Then death and Hades were thrown
into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire. And if
anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the
lake of fire.&quot;  (Revelation 20:11-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Before the ascension of Jesus Christ, Paradise was
located in hell. A great gulf existed between Torments and Paradise.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><img width=540 height=250 id="Picture 1"
src="Hell.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paradise is now empty. Jesus Christ transferred all Old
Testament believers to the third heaven in a Triumphal Procession after His
resurrection and ascension where His perfect humanity was accepted by God the
Father and seated in the Throne Room at the Father’s right hand – the place of
honor. 2 Cor. 12:1-4. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Boasting is necessary, though it is not profitable; but I
will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord. I know a man in Christ who
fourteen years ago—whether in the body I do not know, or out of the body I do
not know, God knows—such a man was caught up to the third heaven. And I know
how such a man—whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know, God
knows— was caught up into Paradise and heard inexpressible words, which a man
is not permitted to speak.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 12:1-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The transfer took place when Jesus ascended to the Third
Heaven. In Ephesians 4:8-10, “a host of captives” were just soul and spirit (no
body) of the Old Testament believers. Today, they are still soul and spirit as
they have no resurrection body yet.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore it says, &quot;WHEN HE ASCENDED ON HIGH, HE LED
CAPTIVE A HOST OF CAPTIVES, AND HE GAVE GIFTS TO MEN.&quot; (Now this
expression, &quot;He ascended,&quot; what does it mean except that He also had
descended into the lower parts of the earth? He who descended is Himself also
He who ascended far above all the heavens, so that He might fill all
things.)&quot;  (Ephesians 4:8-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the pre-ascension days (Old Testament), the rich man
in Torments (in Hades) saw Abraham and Lazarus who were believers and in
Paradise which was afar off, but still in Hades. Unbelievers will be brought
from Torments to face the Last Judgement (Great White Throne) where they will
be judged according to their works and cast into the Lake of Fire also known as
Hell, Tophet, and Gehenna. They may have a body which can burn forever. Luke
16; John 5:29; Matt. 10:28.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; and will come forth; those who did the good deeds to a
resurrection of life, those who committed the evil deeds to a resurrection of
judgment. &quot;  (John 5:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;Do not fear those who kill the body but are unable
to kill the soul; but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body
in hell. &quot;  (Matthew 10:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>No Degrees of Punishment</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Lake of Fire will be a literal place with literal
fire and real brimstone. Rev. 14:10-11; Rev. 19:20; Rev. 20:10; Rev. 21:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;he also will drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which
is mixed in full strength in the cup of His anger; and he will be tormented
with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence
of the Lamb. &quot;And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever;
they have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image, and
whoever receives the mark of his name.&quot;&quot;  (Revelation 14:10-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And the beast was seized, and with him the false prophet
who performed the signs in his presence, by which he deceived those who had
received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image; these two
were thrown alive into the lake of fire which burns with brimstone.&quot; 
(Revelation 19:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake
of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also; and they
will be tormented day and night forever and ever.&quot;  (Revelation 20:10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;But for the cowardly and unbelieving and abominable
and murderers and immoral persons and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars,
their part will be in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the
second death.&quot;&quot;  (Revelation 21:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The false concept that there will be degrees of
punishment in hell tends to destroy the literal Lake of Fire. It is not hotter
in some places than in others. Matt. 25:41; Rev. 20:10; Rev. 20:14-15.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;Then He will also say to those on His left,
'Depart from Me, accursed ones, into the eternal fire which has been prepared
for the devil and his angels; &quot;  (Matthew 25:41, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake
of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also; and they
will be tormented day and night forever and ever.&quot;  (Revelation 20:10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire.
This is the second death, the lake of fire. And if anyone's name was not found
written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.&quot; 
(Revelation 20:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Degrees of punishment is contrary to the doctrine of
Unlimited Atonement. Degrees of punishment destroy the true issue of salvation,
that is rejection of Jesus Christ is the only reason that anyone will be sent
to the Lake of Fire. Sin is not the issue where one rejector would receive less
punishment than another. The issue is always that Christ died for everyone’s
sins. This false theory is actually based on the Hegelian theory - that every
thesis has an antithesis. If there is an antithesis in the context, it will be
stated like in John 3:36.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he
who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on
him.&quot;&quot;  (John 3:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Thesis: It says there will not be sorrow in heaven.
Antithesis: It says there will be sorrow in hell. Thesis: It says there will be
rewards in heaven. Antithesis: None stated. It does not say there will be
degrees of punishment in hell. It seems logical, but often human viewpoint does
seem logical.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One can be dogmatic that there will be no degrees of
punishment in hell on the basis of how sinful the unbeliever was on earth. The false
possibility of degrees of punishment in hell is on the basis of accumulation of
human good where the one who has the largest pile of human good gets the best place
in hell. There is no Scripture for this either.</p>
