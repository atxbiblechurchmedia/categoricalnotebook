<h2>Beloved</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Beloved” is used as a title first for the resurrected Lord
Jesus Christ seated at the right hand of God the Father in the third heaven. “Beloved”
indicates acceptability. Eph. 1:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely
bestowed on us in the Beloved.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 1:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ receives all of the infinite love of the
Father as God and, as true humanity, is therefore called “beloved.” When a
person accepts Jesus Christ as their Savior, they are entered into Union with
Christ and are therefore accepted in the Beloved. John 14:20; 1 Cor. 12:13;
Eph. 1:6; 1 Thess. 1:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>““In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in
Me, and I in you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 14:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether
Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one
Spirit.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 12:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely
bestowed on us in the Beloved.” (Ephesians 1:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“knowing, brethren beloved by God, His choice of you;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Thessalonians 1:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Because of being in union with Christ and being accepted
in the Beloved, we in turn are called “beloved.” We share His title of “beloved.”
1 John 3:1-2. </p>

<p class=Verses>“See how great a love the Father has bestowed on us, that we
would be called children of God; and such we are. For this reason the world
does not know us, because it did not know Him. Beloved, now we are children of
God, and it has not appeared as yet what we will be. We know that when He
appears, we will be like Him, because we will see Him just as He is.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
John 3:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Father loves the believer with exactly the same
amount of love He has for His son, Jesus Christ because the believer is in
union with Christ and not because of something the believer has done. This love
is unchangeable regardless of the condition the believer is in experientially. Therefore
“beloved” is one of the very significant titles for the believer. Col. 3:14; 1
Thess. 1:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Beyond all these things put on love, which is the perfect bond
of unity.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Colossians 3:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“knowing, brethren beloved by God, His choice of you;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Thessalonians 1:4, NASB)</p>
