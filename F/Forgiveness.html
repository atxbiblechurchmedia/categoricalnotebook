<h2><a name="_Forgiveness"></a>Forgiveness</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Forgiveness means to cease to feel resentment toward
another for some real or imagined wrongdoing or to grant relief from a debt
owed. Forgiveness is based on the honor and integrity of the one forgiving.
Forgiveness also includes forgetting whatever was done against you and never
recalling or penalizing the person for what they did in the past. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The work of Jesus Christ on the Cross did <u>not</u>
provide forgiveness. He was judged for the sins of mankind on the Cross and
thereby provided redemption as the <u>basis</u> for forgiveness. Gal. 3:13. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law, having become a
curse for us—for it is written, &quot;CURSED IS EVERYONE WHO HANGS ON A
TREE&quot;—” (Galatians 3:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Redemption is not the same as forgiveness. Redemption is
the means of salvation. Redemption is freedom from the slave market of sin as a
result of faith alone in Christ alone. Forgiveness depends on redemption and is
the result of redemption. All the sins of mankind were judged on the Cross.
Judgment is not forgiveness. There is no forgiveness of sins in redemption and
atonement, only the judgment of all sins. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>No one is forgiven because Christ was judged for their
sins. They are forgiven because they believe in the atoning salvation work of
Jesus Christ on the Cross for their sins. Forgiveness results from the positive
volition of the unbeliever at salvation.  Forgiveness also results from the
positive volition of the believer at the point of confession of sins to God the
Father. Forgiveness results from a decision made by people. Salvation results
from a decision made by God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All sins were judged on the Cross and God the Father was
satisfied with that judgment. God the Father as the judge had to be satisfied
with the judgment. Only the judgment of the Cross satisfied the Father. 1 John
4:10; Eph. 5:2; 1 John 2:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us
and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins.” (1 John 4:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and walk in love, just as Christ also loved you and gave
Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma.”
(Ephesians 5:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins; and not for
ours only, but also for those of the whole world.” (1 John 2:2, NASB)       </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first forgiveness is salvation forgiveness for
eternal life. The first forgiveness qualifies you to live in the eternal state
in a resurrection body. The second forgiveness is forgiveness for the spiritual
life. The second forgiveness qualifies you to continue your spiritual life while
you live on earth. The first and second forgiveness are both based on the
salvation work of Christ on the Cross.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Pre-Salvation Forgiveness</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When you believed in Jesus Christ’s substitutionary
spiritual death on the Cross for your sins, you were forgiven all of your pre-salvation
sins. Your sins were forgiven by God as He is the only one who can forgive
sins. All of your sins up to that point were blotted out and God never
remembers them again. This is the pattern for forgiveness. The decision to
believe in Jesus Christ means the forgiveness of all sins prior to that moment.
Isaiah 43:25; Isaiah 44:22; 2 Cor. 5:21; Psalms 130:3-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I, even I, am the one who wipes out your transgressions
for My own sake, And I will not remember your sins.” (Isaiah 43:25, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I have wiped out your transgressions like a thick cloud
And your sins like a heavy mist. Return to Me, for I have redeemed you.&quot;”
(Isaiah 44:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that
we might become the righteousness of God in Him.” (2 Corinthians 5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“If You, LORD, should mark iniquities, O Lord, who could stand?
But there is forgiveness with You, That You may be feared.” (Psalms 130:3-4,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Forgiveness of sins is based on God's perfect character.
Num. 14:19; 1 John 2:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Pardon, I pray, the iniquity of this people according to
the greatness of Your lovingkindness, just as You also have forgiven this
people, from Egypt even until now.&quot;” (Numbers 14:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“I am writing to you, little children, because your sins have
been forgiven you for His name's sake.” (1 John 2:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Forgiveness is an act of God where the penalty for sins
are cancelled and no guilt remains. Col. 2:13; Eph. 1:7; Acts 13:38; Matt.
6:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“When you were dead in your transgressions and the
uncircumcision of your flesh, He made you alive together with Him, having
forgiven us all our transgressions,” (Colossians 2:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness
of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace” (Ephesians 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Therefore let it be known to you, brethren, that through
Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you,” (Acts 13:38, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“'And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our
debtors.” (Matthew 6:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All sins prior to salvation are removed, forgiven, and
forgotten such as divorce, adultery, drunkenness, etc. Psalms 103:10-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He has not dealt with us according to our sins, Nor rewarded
us according to our iniquities. For as high as the heavens are above the earth,
So great is His lovingkindness toward those who fear Him. As far as the east is
from the west, So far has He removed our transgressions from us.” (Psalms
103:10-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All sins were paid for by the atoning work of Jesus
Christ on the Cross. Isaiah 53:6; 1 Peter 2:24; 1 John 2:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“All of us like sheep have gone astray, Each of us has turned
to his own way; But the LORD has caused the iniquity of us all To fall on Him.”
(Isaiah 53:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, so that
we might die to sin and live to righteousness; for by His wounds you were
healed.” (1 Peter 2:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins; and not for
ours only, but also for those of the whole world.” (1 John 2:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The unbeliever does not have forgiveness of pre-salvation
sins. If the unbeliever never believes in Christ, they are not judged for their
sins at the Great White Throne Judgment. The sins of everyone who will ever
live were judged on the Cross. The unbeliever is only judged for not believing
in Christ. Their name will not be written in the Book of Life. They are judged
on the basis of their good deeds, which cannot ever add up to the perfect
righteousness of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Post-Salvation Forgiveness</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When you confess your known sins to God the Father, He
forgives those sins and the sins you did not recall or know were sins. He
cleanses you from all unrighteousness. 1 John 1:9. </p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You could not be filled with the Holy Spirit at the
moment of salvation unless your sins were forgiven. Believers have to confess
their sins to God the Father to receive forgiveness for their sins and
restoration to fellowship with God because there was no forgiveness provided on
the Cross.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pattern for God's grace for forgiveness is applied to
the believer in the spiritual life. We are to be gracious to others and forgive
them just as God has forgiven us. Col. 3:13; Eph. 4:32; Rom. 12:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, whoever
has a complaint against anyone; just as the Lord forgave you, so also should
you.” (Colossians 3:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other,
just as God in Christ also has forgiven you.” (Ephesians 4:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Never take your own revenge, beloved, but leave room for the
wrath of God, for it is written, &quot;VENGEANCE IS MINE, I WILL REPAY,&quot;
says the Lord.” (Romans 12:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Word of God assures us of our forgiveness. 2 Tim.
1:12; Rom. 4:6-7; Heb. 10:22; Acts 17:31.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason I also suffer these things, but I am not
ashamed; for I know whom I have believed and I am convinced that He is able to
guard what I have entrusted to Him until that day.” (2 Timothy 1:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“just as David also speaks of the blessing on the man to whom
God credits righteousness apart from works: &quot;BLESSED ARE THOSE WHOSE
LAWLESS DEEDS HAVE BEEN FORGIVEN, AND WHOSE SINS HAVE BEEN COVERED.” (Romans
4:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“let us draw near with a sincere heart in full assurance of
faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies
washed with pure water.” (Hebrews 10:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“because He has fixed a day in which He will judge the world in
righteousness through a Man whom He has appointed, having furnished proof to
all men by raising Him from the dead.&quot;” (Acts 17:31, NASB)</p>
