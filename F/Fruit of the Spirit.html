<h2>Fruit of the Spirit</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fruit of the Spirit is the character of Christ being
formed in the believer while being filled with the Holy Spirit. Types of
production of the fruit of the Spirit are toward self, toward other people, and
toward God. Gal. 5:22-23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience,
kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things
there is no law.” (Galatians 5:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fruit of the Spirit toward self includes love, joy,
and peace. Love is a mental attitude or what you think and is the mental
attitude which describes the divine attitude of love. A relaxed mental attitude
toward the human race is free from envy, jealousy, hatred, implacability, etc. 1
Cor. 13:4-7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Love is patient, love is kind and is not jealous; love does
not brag and is not arrogant, does not act unbecomingly; it does not seek its
own, is not provoked, does not take into account a wrong suffered, does not
rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; bears all things,
believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.” (1 Corinthians
13:4-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Joy is the stimulated mental attitude of inner happiness
that comes from knowing Bible doctrine. Peace is mental attitude stability.
First is the peace with God through reconciliation. Second is the peace of God
from the filling of the Holy Spirit. Rom. 5:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with
God through our Lord Jesus Christ,” (Romans 5:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fruit of the Spirit toward other people includes patience,
kindness, and goodness. Patience is a relaxed overt attitude toward the human
race as a result of having love, joy, and inner peace. This is faith-rest under
pressure from people and circumstances while filled with the Holy Spirit. Eph.
4:1-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord, implore you to walk in
a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called, with all
humility and gentleness, with patience, showing tolerance for one another in
love, being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.”
(Ephesians 4:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Kindness is a mental attitude of grace toward others and
giving others the benefit of the doubt. In 2 Timothy 2:24, “must not be
quarrelsome” means that bullying others is wrong. We are to have good manners.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The Lord's bond-servant must not be quarrelsome, but be kind
to all, able to teach, patient when wronged,” (2 Timothy 2:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Goodness is the overt expression of grace. If you think kindness,
you will act with goodness. Eph. 4:32; 1 Thess. 5:15; Col. 3:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other,
just as God in Christ also has forgiven you.” (Ephesians 4:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“See that no one repays another with evil for evil, but always
seek after that which is good for one another and for all people.” (1
Thessalonians 5:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, whoever
has a complaint against anyone; just as the Lord forgave you, so also should
you.” (Colossians 3:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fruit of the Spirit toward God includes faithfulness,
gentleness, and self-control. The fruit of the Spirit is using faith as the
sole means of learning Bible doctrine thereby enabling the Holy Spirit to
transfer spiritually understood information to the left lobe of the soul as <i>gnosis</i>
knowledge. Faith or believe in the understood Bible doctrine enables the Holy
Spirit to convert the <i>gnosis</i> to <i>epignosis</i> or full knowledge and
transfer it to the right lobe of the soul. This is now divine wisdom applicable
to life’s situations and problems. Faith is not operating on rationalism and
empiricism.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Gentleness is humility and is the mental attitude of
grace with regard to divine provision. This is an attitude of grace orientation
- not who and what we are, but who and what He is. We receive humility as we
grow in Bible doctrine. Self-control is self-discipline. This is controlling
your tongue, thoughts, and actions. When it is time to study, you do it. 1 Cor.
9:27.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but I discipline my body and make it my slave, so that, after
I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified.” (1 Corinthians
9:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When you are in fellowship (filled with the Holy Spirit),
you do not necessarily manifest all of the fruit of the Spirit, but various
situations bring out various manifestations.</p>
