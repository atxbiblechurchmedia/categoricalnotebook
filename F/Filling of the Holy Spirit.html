<h2><a name="_D-Filling_of_the_1"></a>Filling of the Holy Spirit</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The filling of God the Holy Spirit is where the
believer’s soul is controlled by the Holy Spirit. This is the only means of
spiritual growth in that the enabling power of the Holy Spirit allows the grace
function of the grace apparatus for perception whereby Bible doctrine is
learned, believed, and applied. This is all about God's grace resources, not
the believer’s human capabilities. Only then can <i>epignosis</i> Bible
doctrine in the right lobe of the soul enable the believer to produce divine
good in their spiritual lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The process of being filled with the Spirit is
accomplished by confession of sin biblically. We are commanded to be habitually
filled with the Holy Spirit. 1 John 1:9, Eph. 5:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&quot;  (1 John
1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation,
but be filled with the Spirit,&quot;  (Ephesians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Spirituality is an Absolute</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The filling of the Holy Spirit is probably the most
misunderstood subject in Christendom. The biblical concept of spirituality only
occurs when the soul of the believer is filled with the Holy Spirit. As a
believer, you are either 100% spiritual with your soul controlled by the Holy
Spirit or you are 100% carnal with your soul controlled by the old sin nature. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are no degrees of spirituality. You are either
carnal or spiritual, either in fellowship or out. Spirituality is an absolute.
At any point in our lives we are either completely spiritual where the Holy
Spirit is controlling our soul or we are completely carnal where the old sin
nature controls the soul due to unconfessed sin in the life. 1 Cor. 3:1-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual
men, but as to men of flesh, as to infants in Christ. I gave you milk to drink,
not solid food; for you were not yet able to receive it. Indeed, even now you
are not yet able, for you are still fleshly. For since there is jealousy and
strife among you, are you not fleshly, and are you not walking like mere
men?&quot;  (1 Corinthians 3:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The old sin nature in the believer can crank out sin and
it can crank out human good. Neither pleases the Lord. The tragedy is that
often human good in the believer passes for spirituality. On the sin side,
there is no sin listed anywhere that a believer has not done, but often we
excuse mental attitude sins such as envy, pride, jealousy, and gossip because they
hit too close to home. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The result of being filled with the Spirit is the state
of being spiritual. Terms such as “walking in the Light” in 1 John 1:7, “become
partakers of the divine nature” in 2 Peter 1:4, “be filled with the Spirit” in
Ephesians 5:18, and “walk by the Spirit” in Galatians 5:16 refer to divine good
production of the spiritual believer. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;but if we walk in the Light as He Himself is in the
Light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son
cleanses us from all sin.&quot;  (1 John 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For by these He has granted to us His precious and magnificent
promises, so that by them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having
escaped the corruption that is in the world by lust.” (2 Peter 1:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but
be filled with the Spirit,” (Ephesians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out
the desire of the flesh.&quot;  (Galatians 5:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Imitation is the great issue in spirituality. The
believer in fellowship imitates Jesus Christ. We are commanded to keep on being
imitators of God. The believer out of fellowship imitates the unbeliever. Eph.
5:1; 1 John 1:6; 2 Cor. 3:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved
children;&quot;  (Ephesians 5:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk
in the darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth;&quot;  (1 John 1:6,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;being manifested that you are a letter of Christ, cared
for by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on
tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 3:3,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Filling of the Spirit is Required For Spiritual
Growth</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To grow spiritually, we must confess or cite known sins to
God the Father that were revealed as sin by the Word of God. 1 John 1:9, Eph.
5:18. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&quot;  (1 John
1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation,
but be filled with the Spirit,&quot;  (Ephesians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spirituality is the result of confessing sin biblically. Then,
one is automatically restored to fellowship and the Holy Spirit can then produce
His fruit or divine good through you. When the believer is filled with the Holy
Spirit, the character of the incarnate Christ is formed in their life. The
“fruit of the Spirit’ is the character of the Christ as He walked on the earth.
Gal. 4:19; Gal. 5:22-23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“My children, with whom I am again in labor until Christ is
formed in you—” (Galatians 4:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,
patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against
such things there is no law.&quot;  (Galatians 5:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual growth is dependent upon the function of the
grace apparatus for perception. The grace apparatus for perception only
functions when positive volition is exercised in faith. Faith is a product of
the Spirit controlled life. The believer out of fellowship cannot exercise
faith. Spirituality expresses itself in faith. Growth is the result. 1 Cor.
2:13; John 16:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“which things we also speak, not in words taught by human
wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, combining spiritual thoughts with
spiritual words.” (1 Corinthians 2:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide
you into all the truth; for He will not speak on His own initiative, but
whatever He hears, He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come.”
(John 16:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The filling of the Holy Spirit is required for absorption
of Bible doctrine. We are command to take in Bible doctrine.  2 Tim. 2:15; 2
Tim. 3:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman
who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth.” (2
Timothy 2:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching,
for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness;” (2 Timothy 3:16,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Spirit Filled Believer Glorifies Jesus Christ </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When the believer is filled with the Holy Spirit, Christ
is at home in the believer’s body. Therefore, the transitional command in
Romans 13:14. Eph. 3:16-17. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for
the flesh in regard to its lusts.” (Romans 13:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory,
to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inner man, so that
Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; and that you, being rooted and
grounded in love,” (Ephesians 3:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ephesians 4:17-18, we are commanded to live the
spiritual life as a believer, not in carnality living like an unbeliever! A
believer can walk in darkness and blindness just like an unbeliever. This is
due to a spiritual vacuum in the mind.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So this I say, and affirm together with the Lord, that you
walk no longer just as the Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their mind,
being darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life of God because of
the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart;”
(Ephesians 4:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ephesians 4:19-20, such a carnality walk in the
believer causes accumulation of scar tissue of the soul. We are commanded to
shape up and not to behave like an unbeliever!</p>

<p class=Verses>“and they, having become callous, have given themselves over to
sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness. But you
did not learn Christ in this way,” (Ephesians 4:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ephesians 4:22-24, confession of sin to God the Father
is the first solution to scar tissue. Intake and application of Bible doctrine
is the second solution to scar tissue. Building of the edification complex is
the third solution to scar tissue.</p>

<p class=Verses>“that, in reference to your former manner of life, you lay
aside the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of
deceit, and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind, and put on the new
self, which in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and
holiness of the truth.” (Ephesians 4:22-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The filling of the Holy Spirit produces the fruit of the
Spirit. “The flesh” refers to the old sin nature. The use of 1 John 1:9
provides cleansing, then the Holy Spirit controls, then the use of the grace
apparatus for perception operates and the edification complex is built. Christ
is then glorified. John 16:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;He will glorify Me, for He will take of Mine and will
disclose it to you.” (John 16:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The glorification of Christ is done through the shining
forth of the edification complex. Believers are “lights” or reflectors. As one
is filled with the Spirit, takes in the Word and transfers it by faith, they
gain a frame of reference which is used to apply the Word of God to experience.
The ultimate in growth is this edification complex based on <i>epignosis</i> or
residual doctrine in the right lobe of the soul. This combined structure brings
maximum glory to God. The believer is reflecting the glory of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When spirituality is cut off for some reason, the
spiritual growth process comes to a screeching halt. This can be done in
several ways by believers. Lying to the Holy Spirit is one way. Quenching the
Holy Spirit is another way which is an act of disobedience not involving an
ethical or moral issues, like neglecting to pray. Grieving the Holy Spirit is
sin involving an ethical or moral issue such as adultery. Acts 5:3; 1 Thess.
5:19; Eph. 4:30.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But Peter said, &quot;Ananias, why has Satan filled your
heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back some of the price of the
land?&quot;  (Acts 5:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Do not quench the Spirit;&quot;  (1 Thessalonians 5:19,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were
sealed for the day of redemption.&quot;  (Ephesians 4:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All believers are ambassadors for Christ, but when a
believer is out of fellowship, their representation of Christ is not Christ
glorifying. 2 Cor. 5:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were
making an appeal through us; we beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to
God.” (2 Corinthians 5:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The carnal believer is commanded to wake up and be
filling with the Holy Spirit and let the Holy Spirit glorify Jesus Christ. Eph.
5:14-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason it says, &quot;Awake, sleeper, And arise from
the dead, And Christ will shine on you.&quot; Therefore be careful how you
walk, not as unwise men but as wise, making the most of your time, because the
days are evil. So then do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the
Lord is. And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but be filled
with the Spirit,” (Ephesians 5:14-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are three general levels of spiritual growth – the
believer with very little Bible doctrine called a “babe”, the growing believer
with some Bible doctrine called an adolescent, and the mature believer with
maximum Bible doctrine in their soul. In 1 John 2:12-14, “little children” are
babes in spiritual growth. “Young men” are adolescents in spiritual growth.
They are growing, but would not be considered spiritually mature. “Fathers” are
adults in spiritual growth.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I am writing to you, little children, because your sins
have been forgiven you for His name's sake. I am writing to you, fathers,
because you know Him who has been from the beginning. I am writing to you,
young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I have written to you,
children, because you know the Father. I have written to you, fathers, because
you know Him who has been from the beginning. I have written to you, young men,
because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome
the evil one.&quot;  (1 John 2:12-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There must be a definite correlation in Christian living
between the absolute concept of spirituality and the concept of spiritual
growth in grace. Therefore, there is an interdependency between the two. Before
the spiritual growth can take place, the principle of absolute spirituality
must be functioning. The following is proof that this is true. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual growth depends upon knowledge. Profitable
knowledge is not or cannot be gained unless filled with the Holy Spirit. This
is true because of the illumination or teaching ministry of the Holy Spirit. 1
Peter 2:1-2; John 14:26.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore, putting aside all malice and all deceit and
hypocrisy and envy and all slander, like newborn babies, long for the pure milk
of the word, so that by it you may grow in respect to salvation,&quot;  (1
Peter 2:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father
will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your
remembrance all that I said to you. &quot;  (John 14:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Results of the Filling of the Holy Spirit </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divine production is only possible when you are filled
with the Holy Spirit. The filling of the Holy Spirit produces many effects in
the growing believer.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Imitation of Christ. John 16:14; 2 Cor. 3:3; Phil.1:20;
Gal. 4:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;He will glorify Me, for He will take of Mine and
will disclose it to you. &quot;  (John 16:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;being manifested that you are a letter of Christ, cared
for by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on
tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 3:3,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;according to my earnest expectation and hope, that I will
not be put to shame in anything, but that with all boldness, Christ will even
now, as always, be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death.&quot; 
(Philippians 1:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;My children, with whom I am again in labor until Christ
is formed in you—&quot;  (Galatians 4:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Perception of the Word. He will guide you in all truth.
John 14:26; John 16:12-14; 1 Cor. 2:9-16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father
will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your
remembrance all that I said to you. &quot;  (John 14:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;I have many more things to say to you, but you
cannot bear them now. &quot;But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will
guide you into all the truth; for He will not speak on His own initiative, but
whatever He hears, He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come.
&quot;He will glorify Me, for He will take of Mine and will disclose it to you.
&quot;  (John 16:12-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Witnessing to the unbeliever. The filling of the Holy
Spirit is required for witnessing to the unbeliever. We are commanded to do so.
God can only use you when filled with the Holy Spirit.  Acts 1:8; 2 Cor. 5:3-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come
upon you; and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and
Samaria, and even to the remotest part of the earth.&quot; &quot;  (Acts 1:8,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;inasmuch as we, having put it on, will not be found
naked. For indeed while we are in this tent, we groan, being burdened, because
we do not want to be unclothed but to be clothed, so that what is mortal will
be swallowed up by life. Now He who prepared us for this very purpose is God,
who gave to us the Spirit as a pledge.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 5:3-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divine guidance. Rom. 8:14; Eph. 5:16-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are
sons of God.&quot;  (Romans 8:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;making the most of your time, because the days are evil.
So then do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is. And do
not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but be filled with the
Spirit,&quot;  (Ephesians 5:16-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Knowing eternal security is true. Rom. 8:14-16; Gal.
4:5-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are
sons of God. For you have not received a spirit of slavery leading to fear
again, but you have received a spirit of adoption as sons by which we cry out,
&quot;Abba! Father!&quot; The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we
are children of God,&quot;  (Romans 8:14-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;so that He might redeem those who were under the Law,
that we might receive the adoption as sons. Because you are sons, God has sent
forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, &quot;Abba!
Father!&quot;&quot;  (Galatians 4:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Worship. Phil. 3:3; John 4:24.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;for we are the true circumcision, who worship in the
Spirit of God and glory in Christ Jesus and put no confidence in the
flesh,&quot;  (Philippians 3:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;God is spirit, and those who worship Him must
worship in spirit and truth.&quot; &quot;  (John 4:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are commanded to pray. Effective prayer is always to
God the Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, and in the power of the Holy
Spirit. Eph. 6:18; Psalms 66:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;With all prayer and petition pray at all times in the
Spirit, and with this in view, be on the alert with all perseverance and
petition for all the saints,&quot;  (Ephesians 6:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If I regard wickedness in my heart, The Lord will not
hear;&quot;  (Psalms 66:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Helping other Christians to confess sin biblically. Gal.
6:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Brethren, even if anyone is caught in any trespass, you
who are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; each one
looking to yourself, so that you too will not be tempted.&quot;  (Galatians
6:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Carnality</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Carnality is where the old sin nature controls the
believer’s soul. Nothing good is produced in the Christian life apart from the
filling of the Holy Spirit. Rom. 8:8; Gal. 3:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and those who are in the flesh cannot please God.&quot; 
(Romans 8:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you
now being perfected by the flesh?&quot;  (Galatians 3:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sin grieves the Holy Spirit and human good quenches His
power in us. Eph. 4:30; 1 Thess. 5:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were
sealed for the day of redemption.&quot;  (Ephesians 4:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Do not quench the Spirit;&quot;  (1 Thessalonians 5:19,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The hindrance to the filling of the Holy Spirit is
unconfessed sin in the life and to be filled with the Holy Spirit, sin must be
confessed using 1 John 1:9. This results in the Holy Spirit filling the life,
motivating and producing divine good. The result is that Christ is glorified in
the believer’s life because the Holy Spirit produces the fruit of the Spirit in
the believer, which is the character of Christ.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&quot;  (1 John
1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>False Spirituality</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When true spirituality is missing, the believer often
replaces it with a false or pseudo spirituality. The practice or proof of false
spirituality is evidenced by ignorance of doctrine like praying for things
already provided. It is also evidenced by faulty deductions like mislabeling
their experiences, psychological variations like gauging spirituality by
psychological make-up, emotional variation such as how they feel, ecstatics,
etc., and superficial evaluation like the size of a local church.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The eight techniques of false spirituality include emphasis
on personality, spirituality by programs, by ritualism, by emotionalism and
ecstatics, by crucifying self, by asceticism, by tabooism involving prohibition
of some act by pain of punishment, by relativity where you measure your sins
against another, by prayer, by yielding, and by discipline, and. Eph. 5:14-18;
Rom. 6:13-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For this reason it says, &quot;Awake, sleeper, And arise
from the dead, And Christ will shine on you.&quot; Therefore be careful how you
walk, not as unwise men but as wise, making the most of your time, because the
days are evil. So then do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the
Lord is. And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but be filled
with the Spirit,&quot;  (Ephesians 5:14-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and do not go on presenting the members of your body to sin as
instruments of unrighteousness; but present yourselves to God as those alive
from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God. For sin
shall not be master over you, for you are not under law but under grace.”
(Romans 6:13-14, NASB)</p>
