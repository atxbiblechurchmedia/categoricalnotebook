<h2><a name="_Filling_of_the_1"></a><a name="_D-Filling_of_the"></a>Filling</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ephesians 3:19, “be filled up” is the Greek word <span
lang=EL>πληρο</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (plēroō) means to fill up a
deficiency, to fully possess, to fully influence, and to fill up with a certain
quality. Maximum <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the soul
takes care of this deficiency. This deficiency is filled up by the teaching
ministry of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that
you may be filled up to all the fullness of God.” (Ephesians 3:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Plēroō</i> is used of the believer controlled by or
filled with the Holy Spirit and in a state of spirituality. Spirituality is not
spiritual growth. Spirituality is the means of spiritual growth. Spirituality
is an absolute as is carnality. You are either completely filled with the Holy
Spirit and the Holy Spirit controls your soul or you are in a state of sin
where the sin nature completely controls your soul. Eph. 5:18. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but
be filled with the Spirit,” (Ephesians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Plēroō</i> is used of the Church Age believer
functioning under the grace apparatus for perception and building an
edification complex in their soul. Eph. 1:23; Eph. 4:10; Col. 1:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all.”
(Ephesians 1:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He who descended is Himself also He who ascended far above all
the heavens, so that He might fill all things.)” (Ephesians 4:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason also, since the day we heard of it, we have
not ceased to pray for you and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge
of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,” (Colossians 1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 2:40, “increasing” is <i>plēroō</i> and is used
of Jesus Christ as a child with His humanity growing spiritually under the
grace apparatus for perception resulting in the building of an edification
complex in His soul.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The Child continued to grow and become strong, increasing in
wisdom; and the grace of God was upon Him.” (Luke 2:40, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Philippians 1:11, “filled” and in Revelation 3:2,
“completed” are <i>plēroō</i> and are used for the maturing believer’s
production of divine good. </p>

<p class=Verses>“having been filled with the fruit of righteousness which comes
through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.” (Philippians 1:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“'Wake up, and strengthen the things that remain, which were
about to die; for I have not found your deeds completed in the sight of My
God.” (Revelation 3:2, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Plēroō</i> is used of the believer growing
spiritually resulting in the fulfillment of inner happiness in the soul. 1 John
1:4; John 16:24; John 17:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“These things we write, so that our joy may be made complete.”
(1 John 1:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Until now you have asked for nothing in My name; ask and
you will receive, so that your joy may be made full.” (John 16:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But now I come to You; and these things I speak in the
world so that they may have My joy made full in themselves.” (John 17:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Plēroō</i> is the word “fulfilled” in Romans 8:4 and
refers to the believer receiving God's blessings as they mature, both in time
and eternity. </p>

<p class=Verses>“so that the requirement of the Law might be fulfilled in us,
who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.” (Romans
8:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Plēroō</i> is used for the believer giving with a
grace attitude based on the Bible doctrine in their soul. Phil 4:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But I have received everything in full and have an abundance;
I am amply supplied, having received from Epaphroditus what you have sent, a
fragrant aroma, an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to God.” (Philippians
4:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Colossians 1:25, “fully carry out” is <i>plēroō</i>
and is used of a pastor-teacher who fulfills the Word of God by faithfully studying
and teaching Bible doctrine to his congregation. He does this by using the ICE
principles of Hermeneutics - Isagogics, Categories, and Exegesis in his
teaching. By doing this, the believers in the local church grow spiritually and
fill up the deficiency they once with <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine to become
spiritually mature.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“Of this church I was made a minister according to the
stewardship from God bestowed on me for your benefit, so that I might fully
carry out the preaching of the word of God,” (Colossians 1:25, NASB)</p>
