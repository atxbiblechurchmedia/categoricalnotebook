<h2>Family, Divine Institution #3</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The family is Divine Institution #3 provided for the
whole human race by God and was set up for the raising and training of
children. It was instituted by God and blessed. Gen. 1:28.</p>

<p class=Verses>“God blessed them; and God said to them, “Be fruitful and
multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and rule over the fish of the sea
and over the birds of the sky and over every living thing that moves on the
earth.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis 1:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s attitude toward the human race is grace. He has
provided for them what they do not earn or deserve. An example of this is salvation.
John 3:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>““For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten
Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John
3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Marriage, Divine Institution #2, is the institution set
up by God for the establishment of a home for the family. Marriage was founded
on love (a mental attitude) and so was the family, Divine Institution #3. Gen.
2:22-24; Eph. 5:28-33.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD God fashioned into a woman the rib which He had taken
from the man, and brought her to the man. The man said, “This is now bone of my
bones, And flesh of my flesh; She shall be called Woman, Because she was taken
out of Man.” For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother, and
be joined to his wife; and they shall become one flesh.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis
2:22-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own
bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself; for no one ever hated his own
flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also does the church,
because we are members of His body. FOR THIS REASON A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS
FATHER AND MOTHER AND SHALL BE JOINED TO HIS WIFE, AND THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE
FLESH. This mystery is great; but I am speaking with reference to Christ and
the church. Nevertheless, each individual among you also is to love his own
wife even as himself, and the wife must see to it that she respects her
husband.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 5:28-33, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Family Interrelationships</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Children are a blessing, but often they are a headache
because of failure on the part of the parents and/or children to be obedient to
the instructions in the Word. Gen. 4:1; Psalms 127:3-5; Prov. 17:21; Prov. 23:24.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now the man had relations with his wife Eve, and she conceived
and gave birth to Cain, and she said, “I have gotten a manchild with the help
of the LORD.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis 4:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Behold, children are a gift of the LORD, The fruit of the womb
is a reward. Like arrows in the hand of a warrior, So are the children of one’s
youth. How blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them; They will not be
ashamed When they speak with their enemies in the gate.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms
127:3-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He who sires a fool does so to his sorrow, And the father of a
fool has no joy.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 17:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice, And he who
sires a wise son will be glad in him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 23:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One of the most common problems in the home is that of
rebellion and resentment which are problems of mental attitude. There is a bona
fide independent use of volition on the part of a maturing adolescent, tempered
with a mental attitude respect toward parents and use of good judgment.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For example, when dating a boy or girl who is a believer
and/or a believer learning Bible doctrine and the parents do not like his or
her personality, but the young people have compatible personalities. Therefore,
in using their own volition, the boy or girl should show their mental attitude
respect openly and heed their parents’ concerns.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The key to better understanding the home is the proper
mental attitude of parents and children. Both parents and children must face
this problem and seek a solution in order that harmony might prevail so that
your children may be a lump in your throat and not a pain in your neck.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The proper mental attitude in the home and elsewhere
comes through the filling of the Holy Spirit and the knowledge of Bible doctrine.
The Christian way of life in the home and outside the home is a supernatural
way of life, which cannot be lived apart from the control of the Holy Spirit. Rom.
8:2; Rom. 7:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you
free from the law of sin and of death.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 8:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But now we have been released from the Law, having died to
that by which we were bound, so that we serve in newness of the Spirit and not
in oldness of the letter.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 7:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Responsibility of Children</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The responsibility of children toward God is that they
individually are responsible to make their decision regarding salvation. God
desires to have a relationship with each and every one of us. Only after each
of us have made this decision (only you are responsible for that decision) that
we can truly be a “wise” son or daughter. Prov. 1:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; Fools
despise wisdom and instruction.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believing child is responsible for their relationship
with the Lord. Children are to learn the Word (Bible doctrine) and use those biblical
techniques to handle issues, problems, and decisions in the Christian life. For
confession of sin, use 1 John 1:9. For faith-rest, use Proverbs 1:7. To build
your edification complex as quickly as possible, use Ephesians 4:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; Fools
despise wisdom and instruction.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by
what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual
part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians
4:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Children have a responsibility toward their parents. Rebellion
against parental authority is sin. Sin withholds good things from you. Jer.
5:25; Prov. 30:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“‘Your iniquities have turned these away, And your sins have
withheld good from you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jeremiah 5:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“There is a kind of man who curses his father And does not
bless his mother.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 30:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Rebellion against parental authority may ultimately
result in violent death. Prov. 30:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The eye that mocks a father And scorns a mother, The ravens of
the valley will pick it out, And the young eagles will eat it.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs
30:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Children are commanded by God to obey their parents (as a
minor) and to honor them for life. Exodus 20:12; Col. 3:20; Deut. 5:16; Eph. 6:1-4.
</p>

<p class=Verses>““Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be
prolonged in the land which the LORD your God gives you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Exodus
20:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Children, be obedient to your parents in all things, for this
is well-pleasing to the Lord.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Colossians 3:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“‘Honor your father and your mother, as the LORD your God has
commanded you, that your days may be prolonged and that it may go well with you
on the land which the LORD your God gives you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Deuteronomy 5:16,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.
HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER (which is the first commandment with a promise),
SO THAT IT MAY BE WELL WITH YOU, AND THAT YOU MAY LIVE LONG ON THE EARTH.
Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the
discipline and instruction of the Lord.” (Ephesians 6:1-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To honor is to respect their better judgment, their
instructions, their advice and their rules. To honor them is to think highly of
them. Honoring is for the duration of a child’s life, obeying is not. Children
should understand and perform their responsibilities toward God and their
parents. The whole package is called appreciation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Children with believing parents should be thankful for
them and respond with helpfulness and cooperation. They should realize how
valuable this Christian training is. Children are to obey their parents
(believer or unbeliever) even if you think they are unwise. This is their
responsibility. Trust the Lord to direct you and let Him show your parents that
they have been unwise. Prov. 3:5-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Trust in the LORD with all your heart And do not lean on your
own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He will make your
paths straight.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 3:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Heed parental instruction by listening to what they say
and what they want you to do. Prov. 1:8; Prov. 23:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Hear, my son, your father’s instruction And do not forsake
your mother’s teaching;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 1:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Apply your heart to discipline And your ears to words of
knowledge.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 23:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Children must provide for aged and needy parents. 1 Tim.
5:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but if any widow has children or grandchildren, they must
first learn to practice piety in regard to their own family and to make some
return to their parents; for this is acceptable in the sight of God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Timothy 5:4, NASB)</p>
