<h2>No Food is Unclean</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Under the Mosaic Law, certain foods were claimed to be
unclean such as pork, etc. But union with Jesus Christ frees believers from the
Mosaic Law. We are now under a higher law - the law of the filling of the Holy
Spirit. Rom. 14:1-14; Rom. 8:2-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now accept the one who is weak in faith, but not for the
purpose of passing judgment on his opinions. One person has faith that he may
eat all things, but he who is weak eats vegetables only. The one who eats is
not to regard with contempt the one who does not eat, and the one who does not
eat is not to judge the one who eats, for God has accepted him. Who are you to
judge the servant of another? To his own master he stands or falls; and he will
stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand.” (Romans 14:1-4, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing is
unclean in itself; but to him who thinks anything to be unclean, to him it is
unclean.” (Romans 14:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you
free from the law of sin and of death. For what the Law could not do, weak as
it was through the flesh, God did: sending His own Son in the likeness of
sinful flesh and as an offering for sin, He condemned sin in the flesh, so that
the requirement of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according
to the flesh but according to the Spirit.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 8:2-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Under this new law, food categories of clean and unclean
are gone. All foods are clean. These are only clean to the believer who is
oriented to grace and understands the pertinent doctrine. The Mosaic Law
rejected certain meats and Jewish believers were still offended when others ate
pork. The Gentile’s prejudice was based on eating meat offered to idols.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The legalistic believer is weak and lives by their
background and prejudices from human viewpoint. They are minus doctrine and
because of this, they apply their personal prejudices to every situation and
tries to superimpose their taboos on others. It obscures life for themselves
and others. The Christian way of life is what you should think. Because of all
these factors, the legalistic believer takes a clean thing (food) and makes it
unclean by human viewpoint. See category on <a href="#_D-Laws_for_Doubtful">Laws
for Doubtful Things</a>.</p>
