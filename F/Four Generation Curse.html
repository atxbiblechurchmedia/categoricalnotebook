<h2><a name="_Four_Generation_Curse"></a><a name="_D-Four_Generation_Curse"></a>Four
Generation Curse</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The four generation curse is the propagation of sins and
resulting divine discipline from one generation to the next with parents and
children of each generation willing in their negative volition and rejection of
God. Each generation is responsible for its own negative volition to God and to
Jesus Christ. Each member of the human race is responsible for their own
decisions and the consequences of those decisions.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This curse does not apply to anyone who believes in Jesus
Christ or to any unbeliever oriented to the Laws of Divine Establishment. Also,
this curse never applies to the believer unless they remain in continual
carnality. Continual negative volition is the basis for being under the four
generation curse. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Moses received information from God regarding the four
generation curse. This information explains why problems continue and become
worse from one generation to another. Exodus 20:4-6 was a warning for the
Exodus generation against idolatry and demonism that were practiced by the
Canaanites that occupied the Land. This four generation curse is also mentioned
in Deuteronomy 5:8-10, Exodus 34:6-7, and Numbers 14:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You shall not make for yourself an idol, or any likeness
of what is in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the water under the
earth. &quot;You shall not worship them or serve them; for I, the LORD your
God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, on
the third and the fourth generations of those who hate Me, but showing
lovingkindness to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments.”
(Exodus 20:4-6, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“'The LORD is slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness,
forgiving iniquity and transgression; but He will by no means clear the guilty,
visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and the
fourth generations.'” (Numbers 14:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Even under the fifth cycle of discipline of a nation, God
always shows mercy to those believers who live the spiritual life in accordance
with the Word of God and what God reveals about His plan for their lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Mechanics of the Four Generation Curse</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Rejection of divinely-authorized authority is the
greatest cause for suffering in life. Divine Institution #1 is Volition or free
will. You are free to make your own decisions and choices. You also must accept
the consequences and responsibility of all of your decisions and choices. You
will never enjoy your freedom until you understand and accept authority.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the home, your parents function within Divine
Institution #2 – Marriage. They were your first lesson in authority orientation
as part of Divine Institution #3 - Family. This is why national suffering is
related to the proper function of families in that nation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first generation of a four generation curse rejects
authority and begins doing so in the home. They reject the basic authority of
their parents in preference to what they want. They have no authority
orientation. The greatest suffering and instability in life comes from
rejection of parental authority. Prov. 30:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“There is a kind of man who curses his father And does not
bless his mother.” (Proverbs 30:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Your mental attitude toward your parental authority
determines your mental attitude toward everyone else and everything in society.
If you know drugs like marijuana are illegal, but you use them anyway, you are
rebelling against legitimate authority. You know speed limits are to be kept,
but if you consistently exceed them, you are rebelling against divinely-sanctioned
authority. A nation of people with these rebellious attitudes will ultimately
lead to its destruction. </p>

<p class=Verses>“There is a kind of man who curses his father And does not
bless his mother.”  (Proverbs 30:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The second generation is self-righteous and a law unto
themselves. They are filled with self-righteous arrogance. When the first
generation of parents teach their children self-righteous arrogance, their
children in the second generation carry it on by making that arrogance their
own. For them, it becomes more intense and all consuming. Prov. 30:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“There is a kind who is pure in his own eyes, Yet is not washed
from his filthiness.”  (Proverbs 30:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The second generation is characterized by thinking of
themselves as pure and clean and better than others. However, they are unaware
that they are filthy and unwashed to the objective eye. They are similar to the
priests in Malachi 2:3 who did not want God or Bible doctrine. They wished to
live their lives their way apart from divinely-established authority. This is
the second level of rebellion.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Behold, I am going to rebuke your offspring, and I will
spread refuse on your faces, the refuse of your feasts; and you will be taken
away with it.”  (Malachi 2:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The third generation is characterized by a mature
self-righteousness, locked-in arrogance, excessive pride, and self-sufficiency.
They are also more defiant, rebellious, mocking, and sordid than the previous
generation. Prov. 30:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“There is a kind—oh how lofty are his eyes! And his eyelids are
raised in arrogance.”  (Proverbs 30:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fourth generation is the most corrupt of all, having
repeated all the sins of the past three generations plus their own. The fourth
generation has inordinate ambition and lust for power.  They will do anything
to get what they want. They are characterized by violence, a mental attitude of
robbery, pillage, rape, and complete dissatisfaction with everything in the
nation. They want everything from everyone else. They become traitorous,
parasitic on society, and have little if any ambition to provide for themselves.
</p>

<p class=Verses>“There is a kind of man whose teeth are like swords And his jaw
teeth like knives, To devour the afflicted from the earth And the needy from
among men. The leech has two daughters, “Give,” “Give.” There are three things
that will not be satisfied, Four that will not say, “Enough”: Sheol, and the
barren womb, Earth that is never satisfied with water, And fire that never
says, “Enough.” The eye that mocks a father And scorns a mother, The ravens of
the valley will pick it out, And the young eagles will eat it.”  (Proverbs
30:14-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This fourth generation mocks their fathers and scorns
their mothers. This is way beyond just rebellion against parental authority.
They deride, ridicule and hold their parents in contempt.  “Ravens (buzzards)
of the valley shall pick it out” is an idiom for violent death. Uncontrolled
lawlessness in a nation will lead to severe divine discipline and even violent
death.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><a name="_D-Human_Freedom"></a><b>Responsibility for
Decisions</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God holds us responsible only for our own sins and not
the sins of our parents or those of our children. Deut. 24:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Fathers shall not be put to death for their sons, nor
shall sons be put to death for their fathers; everyone shall be put to death
for his own sin.” (Deuteronomy 24:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The four generation curse never exists except where the
children of the preceding generation commit the same sins as their parents with
more intensity and add more sins to them. Divine discipline results when the
children repeat the sins of their parents from their own volition or follow the
volition of other apostates in their own generation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Children have a tendency to repeat the sins of their
parents, i.e., the arrogance, the vanity, and the mental attitude sins. 
Choosing to repeat these sins from your own volition results in passing these
down to the next generation where divine discipline is intensified.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 100:5, the word “good” refers to God’s perfect
essence. God deals personally and graciously with those who break the four
generation curse through positive volition.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the LORD is good; His lovingkindness is everlasting And
His faithfulness to all generations.” (Psalms 100:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God administers divine discipline to the children
regarding the sins of their parents only for those who make their parents’ sins
their own and continue in the footsteps of their parents in rejection of God
and disobedience to His mandates. Jer. 31:29-30.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;In those days they will not say again, 'The fathers have
eaten sour grapes, And the children's teeth are set on edge.' &quot;But
everyone will die for his own iniquity; each man who eats the sour grapes, his
teeth will be set on edge.” (Jeremiah 31:29-30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The four generation curse can be broken in any
generation. The four generation curse is broken by salvation through faith in
Christ plus the intake and application of Bible doctrine by parents teaching
their children the spiritual life. Deut. 7:9; Deut. 6:9; Psalms 100:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Know therefore that the LORD your God, He is God, the
faithful God, who keeps His covenant and His lovingkindness to a thousandth
generation with those who love Him and keep His commandments;” (Deuteronomy
7:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and
on your gates.” (Deuteronomy 6:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the LORD is good; His lovingkindness is everlasting And
His faithfulness to all generations.” (Psalms 100:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Solution to the Four Generation Curse</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s solution to the four generation curse is always
extensive training of the people in the Divine Institutions and the Laws of
Divine Establishment, salvation by faith alone in Jesus Christ alone, and the
believers’ spiritual growth in Bible doctrine. A nation rises or falls on the
basis of adherence to the Divine Institutions, adherence to the Laws of Divine
Establishment and dissemination of the Word of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Thessalonians had heard about the future return of
Jesus Christ at the Rapture of the Church and decided to do nothing since they
thought He was coming back very soon. It has been almost 2000 years since 1
Thessalonians was written in 54 AD. They would have had a long wait.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a
shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, and the
dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain will be caught
up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we
shall always be with the Lord.&quot;  (1 Thessalonians 4:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some of you may think that our nation’s degeneration
cannot be stopped and get the idea, “What’s the use?” You think you will die
anyway and the nation is going to be destroyed. So you go lazy, you sluff off
the unpleasant things of life, your mental attitude is laziness, etc. So will
our nation fall? Are we going to be judged? Will our nation be an occupied
nation? Are many of us going to die?</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The plan of God makes His grace resources available to
all believers to live a contented life under all possible conditions and
situations. His plan is always for the believer to use His grace resources to
“handle everything” not to avoid it. </p>
