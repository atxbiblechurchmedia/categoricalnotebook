<h2><a name="_Faith,_Spiritual_Gift_1"></a>Faith, Spiritual Gift</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The gift of faith is a permanent spiritual gift. Believers
with this particular gift manifest the Holy Spirit through an extraordinary
“proportion” of faith enabling them to come alongside and help other believers
who may be weak in faith. 1 Cor. 12:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;to another faith by the same Spirit, and to another gifts
of healing by the one Spirit,&quot;  (1 Corinthians 12:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Such believers would obviously anchor congregational
prayer meetings. Such believers would also thrive in hospital or visitation
ministries. Rom. 12:6; Rom. 14:1; James 1:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Since we have gifts that differ according to the grace given
to us, each of us is to exercise them accordingly: if prophecy, according to
the proportion of his faith;” (Romans 12:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now accept the one who is weak in faith, but not for the
purpose of passing judgment on his opinions.” (Romans 14:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But he must ask in faith without any doubting, for the one who
doubts is like the surf of the sea, driven and tossed by the wind.” (James 1:6,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Since the fruit of the Spirit is divine good production
in the spiritual life, every believer ought to express faith to one another.
Gal. 5:22; James 2:17; Heb. 11:33-38.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience,
kindness, goodness, faithfulness,” (Galatians 5:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead, being by itself.”
(James 2:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“who by faith conquered kingdoms, performed acts of
righteousness, obtained promises, shut the mouths of lions, quenched the power
of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, became
mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight. Women received back their dead by
resurrection; and others were tortured, not accepting their release, so that
they might obtain a better resurrection; and others experienced mockings and
scourgings, yes, also chains and imprisonment. They were stoned, they were sawn
in two, they were tempted, they were put to death with the sword; they went
about in sheepskins, in goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated (men
of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts and mountains and caves
and holes in the ground.” (Hebrews 11:33-38, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A believer with the gift of faith is able to demonstrate
faith in a group which is under great adversity. While other believers would be
complaining about some situation or circumstance, this believer would exercise
great faith in the deliverance of God and encourage that group of believers to
depend on the Lord. This person would exercise their gift of faith to comfort
them with promises and Bible doctrine. This was the faith that “removes
mountains” in 1 Corinthians 13:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries
and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do
not have love, I am nothing.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 13:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The spiritual gift of faith is not synonymous with faith
for believing such as faith alone in Christ alone for salvation. It is not
synonymous with faith as a non-meritorious system of perception as we use for
believing and applying Bible doctrine to life’s situations. We already have
that faith as believers in the Church Age. We are born with the ability to
express faith. It's not the same as the faith-rest life. It is not synonymous
with knowing and claiming the promises or the doctrines of God. This is not
knowing the faith-rest rationales, utilizing them and arriving at doctrinal
conclusions and taking control of any situation. This is not the faith which is
a component of the Christian way of life. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Remember that the spiritual gift of faith is a manifestation
of the power of the Holy Spirit through an extraordinary “proportion” of faith
enabling them to come alongside and help other believers who may be weak in
faith.</p>
