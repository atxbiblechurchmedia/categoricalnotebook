<h2><a name="_Jewish_Feasts"></a><a name="_D-Jewish_Feasts"></a>Jewish Feasts </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Jewish feasts listed below were applicable to the
Jewish Age, therefore, only legitimate before the Church Age began and before the
Canon of Scripture was completed in 96 AD. Lev. 23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD spoke again to Moses, saying, “Speak to the sons of
Israel and say to them, ‘The LORD’S appointed times which you shall proclaim as
holy convocations—My appointed times are these:”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Leviticus 23:1-2,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Sabbath</b> </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Sabbath was celebrated every week on Saturday as a
day of rest in recognition of all that God has provided in His grace. Lev. 23:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“‘For six days work may be done, but on the seventh day there
is a sabbath of complete rest, a holy convocation. You shall not do any work;
it is a sabbath to the LORD in all your dwellings.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Leviticus 23:3,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><img width=500 height=200 id="Picture 1"
src="Jewish%20Feasts.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Feast of the Passover</b> </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Feast of the Passover represents Jesus Christ’s death
on the Cross as the basis for our redemption and the deliverance of Israel from
Egypt. The Feast of the Passover was celebrated on the 14th of April and was one
day in length. “Your lamb shall be an unblemished male a year old” in Exodus
12:3-6 represents our Lord Jesus Christ who was perfectly sinless in His
humanity. Christ died on the last Passover. 1 Cor. 5:7; Lev. 23:5; Deut. 16:1; Exodus
12:3-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Clean out the old leaven so that you may be a new lump, just
as you are in fact unleavened. For Christ our Passover also has been
sacrificed.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 5:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“‘In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at
twilight is the LORD’S Passover.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Leviticus 23:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““Observe the month of Abib and celebrate the Passover to the
LORD your God, for in the month of Abib the LORD your God brought you out of
Egypt by night.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Deuteronomy 16:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““Speak to all the congregation of Israel, saying, ‘On the
tenth of this month they are each one to take a lamb for themselves, according
to their fathers’ households, a lamb for each household. ‘Now if the household
is too small for a lamb, then he and his neighbor nearest to his house are to
take one according to the number of persons in them; according to what each man
should eat, you are to divide the lamb. ‘Your lamb shall be an unblemished male
a year old; you may take it from the sheep or from the goats. ‘You shall keep
it until the fourteenth day of the same month, then the whole assembly of the
congregation of Israel is to kill it at twilight.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Exodus 12:3-6,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Feast of Unleavened Bread</b> </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Feast of Unleavened Bread spoke of fellowship with the
Lord. This was one week in duration and was celebrated on 15-27 April. Lev.
23:6-8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“‘Then on the fifteenth day of the same month there is the
Feast of Unleavened Bread to the LORD; for seven days you shall eat unleavened
bread. ‘On the first day you shall have a holy convocation; you shall not do
any laborious work. ‘But for seven days you shall present an offering by fire
to the LORD. On the seventh day is a holy convocation; you shall not do any
laborious work.’““&nbsp;&nbsp;(Leviticus 23:6-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Feast of First Fruits</b> </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Feast of First Fruits represents Jesus Christ’s
resurrection and subsequent resurrection of all believers. It was celebrated on
Sunday, 18 April before dawn each year which was on the first Sunday in the
Feast of Unleavened Bread. It was a gift offering. Jesus Christ rose again on
the Feast of First Fruits. Lev. 2:12; Lev. 23:9-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“‘As an offering of first fruits you shall bring them to the
LORD, but they shall not ascend for a soothing aroma on the altar.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Leviticus
2:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, “Speak to the sons of
Israel and say to them, ‘When you enter the land which I am going to give to
you and reap its harvest, then you shall bring in the sheaf of the first fruits
of your harvest to the priest. ‘He shall wave the sheaf before the LORD for you
to be accepted; on the day after the sabbath the priest shall wave it. ‘Now on
the day when you wave the sheaf, you shall offer a male lamb one year old
without defect for a burnt offering to the LORD. ‘Its grain offering shall then
be two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil, an offering by fire to
the LORD for a soothing aroma, with its drink offering, a fourth of a hin of
wine. ‘Until this same day, until you have brought in the offering of your God,
you shall eat neither bread nor roasted grain nor new growth. It is to be a
perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwelling places.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Leviticus
23:9-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Feast of Pentecost</b> </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Feast of Pentecost signaled the beginning of the
Church Age and celebrates the power of the Holy Spirit. Pentecost means 50
days. The Holy Spirit indwells all Church Age believers. It occurred 50 days
after the Feast of First Fruits. It began the 5th Cycle of Discipline of Israel
and its ultimate dispersion in 70 AD. It was celebrated each year on Sunday, 6
June. Lev. 23:15-16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“‘You shall also count for yourselves from the day after the
sabbath, from the day when you brought in the sheaf of the wave offering; there
shall be seven complete sabbaths. ‘You shall count fifty days to the day after
the seventh sabbath; then you shall present a new grain offering to the LORD.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Leviticus
23:15-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Feast of Trumpets</b> </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Feast of Trumpets represents the Second Advent of
Jesus Christ. This feast was one day in length and was celebrated on 1 October
each year. In the Tribulation, Israel’s believing remnant will be regathered in
the Land. This will be the end of Israel’s 5th cycle of discipline. Lev.
23:23-25. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Again the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, “Speak to the sons of
Israel, saying, ‘In the seventh month on the first of the month you shall have
a rest, a reminder by blowing of trumpets, a holy convocation. ‘You shall not
do any laborious work, but you shall present an offering by fire to the LORD.’““&nbsp;&nbsp;(Leviticus
23:23-25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Feast of Atonement</b> </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Feast of Atonement celebrates the faithfulness of God
and represents the salvation of Israel. On this day, the high priest entered
into the Holy of Holies. This will be the result of the Baptism of Fire. This
is Yom Kippur and is a 10-day feast and was celebrated on 10 October and speaks
of the fulfillment of the four Unconditional Covenants to regenerate Jews in Israel
at the Second Advent. Lev. 23:26-32. </p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD spoke to Moses, saying, “On exactly the tenth day of
this seventh month is the day of atonement; it shall be a holy convocation for
you, and you shall humble your souls and present an offering by fire to the
LORD. “You shall not do any work on this same day, for it is a day of
atonement, to make atonement on your behalf before the LORD your God. “If there
is any person who will not humble himself on this same day, he shall be cut off
from his people. “As for any person who does any work on this same day, that
person I will destroy from among his people. “You shall do no work at all. It
is to be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwelling
places. “It is to be a sabbath of complete rest to you, and you shall humble
your souls; on the ninth of the month at evening, from evening until evening
you shall keep your sabbath.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Leviticus 23:26-32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Feast of Tabernacles</b> </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Feast of Tabernacles <span style='background:white'>was
celebrated in commemoration of the Israelites’ dwelling in tents in the
wilderness for forty years. It is also called the Feast of Booths and r</span>epresents
the Millennial reign of Christ on earth with perfect environment. This feast is
celebrated on 15 October each year and is seven days in length. During this
feast, there was no work to be done. Each family would be in their own booth
made of tree branches. The father who was the spiritual leader of the family
would teach Bible doctrine to his family. On the first and eighth day, they
would have a holy convocation or celebration. Lev. 23:34-41; Num. 29:12; Num.
29:35.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, 'On the fifteenth
of this seventh month is the Feast of Booths for seven days to the LORD. 'On
the first day is a holy convocation; you shall do no laborious work of any
kind. 'For seven days you shall present an offering by fire to the LORD. On the
eighth day you shall have a holy convocation and present an offering by fire to
the LORD; it is an assembly. You shall do no laborious work.” (Leviticus
23:34-36, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“'Now on the first day you shall take for yourselves the
foliage of beautiful trees, palm branches and boughs of leafy trees and willows
of the brook, and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God for seven days.
'You shall thus celebrate it as a feast to the LORD for seven days in the year.
It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations; you shall
celebrate it in the seventh month.” (Leviticus 23:40-41, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“'Then on the fifteenth day of the seventh month you shall have
a holy convocation; you shall do no laborious work, and you shall observe a
feast to the LORD for seven days.” (Numbers 29:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“'On the eighth day you shall have a solemn assembly; you shall
do no laborious work.” (Numbers 29:35, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Feast of Lights (Purim) or <span style='background:

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='background:white'>The Feast of Lights
(Purim) or Hanukkah or the Jewish</span><span class=apple-converted-space><span
style='font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:#222222;background:white'>&nbsp;</span></span>Festival

feast remembers the rededication of the second Jewish Temple in Jerusalem in
164 BC. This feast represents deliverance. Rom 8:28.</span></p>

<p class=Verses>“And we know that God causes all things to work together for
good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.”
(Romans 8:28, NASB)</p>
