<h2>First Born</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>Primogeniture is defined as<span
style='background:white'> is the right, by law or custom, of the firstborn
legitimate son to&nbsp;</span>inherit<span style='background:white'>&nbsp;his
parent’s entire or main&nbsp;</span>estate<span style='background:white'>&nbsp;in
preference to shared inheritance among all or some children, any illegitimate
child or any collateral relative. </span></span>The firstborn connotes three
things technically used in connection with Israel - rulership, priesthood, and
double portion. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Rulership</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Regarding the 12 Tribes of Israel, Reuben was the first
born, but Reuben lost his rights as firstborn. Reuben’s failure was his mental
attitude instability that lead to unstable actions. He was also guilty of
incest. Gen. 49:3-4; Gen. 35:22-23; 1 Chron. 5:1-2</p>

<p class=Verses>““Reuben, you are my firstborn; My might and the beginning of
my strength, Preeminent in dignity and preeminent in power. “Uncontrolled as
water, you shall not have preeminence, Because you went up to your father’s
bed; Then you defiled it—he went up to my couch.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis 49:3-4,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“It came about while Israel was dwelling in that land, that
Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father’s concubine, and Israel heard of it.
Now there were twelve sons of Jacob— the sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacob’s
firstborn, then Simeon and Levi and Judah and Issachar and Zebulun;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis
35:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel (for he was the
firstborn, but because he defiled his father’s bed, his birthright was given to
the sons of Joseph the son of Israel; so that he is not enrolled in the
genealogy according to the birthright. Though Judah prevailed over his
brothers, and from him came the leader, yet the birthright belonged to Joseph),”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Chronicles 5:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Reuben lost the rulership to Judah. David came from the
Tribe of Judah. God’s promise was to David -  The Davidic Covenant. 2 Sam.
7:8-16.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Now therefore, thus you shall say to My servant David, ‘Thus
says the LORD of hosts, “I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep,
to be ruler over My people Israel. “I have been with you wherever you have gone
and have cut off all your enemies from before you; and I will make you a great
name, like the names of the great men who are on the earth. “I will also
appoint a place for My people Israel and will plant them, that they may live in
their own place and not be disturbed again, nor will the wicked afflict them
any more as formerly, even from the day that I commanded judges to be over My
people Israel; and I will give you rest from all your enemies. The LORD also
declares to you that the LORD will make a house for you. “When your days are
complete and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your descendant
after you, who will come forth from you, and I will establish his kingdom. “He
shall build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom
forever. “I will be a father to him and he will be a son to Me; when he commits
iniquity, I will correct him with the rod of men and the strokes of the sons of
men, but My lovingkindness shall not depart from him, as I took it away from
Saul, whom I removed from before you. “Your house and your kingdom shall endure
before Me forever; your throne shall be established forever.”‘““&nbsp;&nbsp;(2
Samuel 7:8-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Regarding Jesus Christ, He is the absolute ruler in His
humanity. He is called “first born” in Luke 2:7 and Colossians 1:15. He is the
precious corner stone in 1 Peter 2:5-7. He is ruler over the regenerate of
Israel in eternity as the Son of David. He is head of the Church invisible and
universal.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And she gave birth to her firstborn son; and she wrapped Him
in cloths, and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the
inn.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Luke 2:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all
creation.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Colossians 1:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“you also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual
house for a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
through Jesus Christ. For this is contained in Scripture: “BEHOLD, I LAY IN
ZION A CHOICE STONE, A PRECIOUS CORNER stone, AND HE WHO BELIEVES IN HIM WILL
NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.” This precious value, then, is for you who believe; but
for those who disbelieve, “THE STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS REJECTED, THIS BECAME
THE VERY CORNER stone,”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Peter 2:5-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Priesthood</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Regarding Reuben, he lost the priesthood to Levi. Num.
18:20-24. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD said to Aaron, “You shall have no inheritance in
their land nor own any portion among them; I am your portion and your
inheritance among the sons of Israel. “To the sons of Levi, behold, I have
given all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service
which they perform, the service of the tent of meeting. “The sons of Israel
shall not come near the tent of meeting again, or they will bear sin and die. “Only
the Levites shall perform the service of the tent of meeting, and they shall
bear their iniquity; it shall be a perpetual statute throughout your
generations, and among the sons of Israel they shall have no inheritance. “For
the tithe of the sons of Israel, which they offer as an offering to the LORD, I
have given to the Levites for an inheritance; therefore I have said concerning
them, ‘They shall have no inheritance among the sons of Israel.’““&nbsp;&nbsp;(Numbers
18:20-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Levi was equally guilty with Simeon (Gen. 34:25-31) but,
eventually Levi used the grace of God via confession of sin and Simeon did not.
Cursing was turned to blessing. The cursing was to never inherit the land. The
blessing was the appointment to the priesthood. Levi’s confession of sin is
found in Exodus 32, Deut. 33, Numbers 8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now it came about on the third day, when they were in pain,
that two of Jacob’s sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, each took his
sword and came upon the city unawares, and killed every male. They killed Hamor
and his son Shechem with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah from Shechem’s
house, and went forth. Jacob’s sons came upon the slain and looted the city,
because they had defiled their sister. They took their flocks and their herds
and their donkeys, and that which was in the city and that which was in the
field; and they captured and looted all their wealth and all their little ones
and their wives, even all that was in the houses. Then Jacob said to Simeon and
Levi, “You have brought trouble on me by making me odious among the inhabitants
of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites; and my men being few in
number, they will gather together against me and attack me and I will be
destroyed, I and my household.” But they said, “Should he treat our sister as a
harlot?”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis 34:25-31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Regarding Jesus Christ, He is our high priest. Church Age
believers are all placed into union with Jesus Christ at salvation by the Baptism
of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, we are all believer priests. Heb. 4:14; 1 Peter
2:5-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed
through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews
4:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“you also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual
house for a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
through Jesus Christ. For this is contained in Scripture: “BEHOLD, I LAY IN
ZION A CHOICE STONE, A PRECIOUS CORNER stone, AND HE WHO BELIEVES IN HIM WILL
NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.” This precious value, then, is for you who believe; but
for those who disbelieve, “THE STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS REJECTED, THIS BECAME
THE VERY CORNER stone,” and, “A STONE OF STUMBLING AND A ROCK OF OFFENSE”; for
they stumble because they are disobedient to the word, and to this doom they
were also appointed. But you are A CHOSEN RACE, A royal PRIESTHOOD, A HOLY
NATION, A PEOPLE FOR God’s OWN POSSESSION, so that you may proclaim the
excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous
light;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Peter 2:5-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Double Portion</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Regarding Reuben, he lost the double portion to Joseph.
This became the largest tribe. Ephraim (largest) and Manasseh (Joseph’s sons)
outnumbered the others. Gen. 49:22-26.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Joseph is a fruitful bough, A fruitful bough by a spring; Its
branches run over a wall. “The archers bitterly attacked him, And shot at him
and harassed him; But his bow remained firm, And his arms were agile, From the
hands of the Mighty One of Jacob (From there is the Shepherd, the Stone of
Israel), From the God of your father who helps you, And by the Almighty who
blesses you With blessings of heaven above, Blessings of the deep that lies
beneath, Blessings of the breasts and of the womb. “The blessings of your
father Have surpassed the blessings of my ancestors Up to the utmost bound of
the everlasting hills; May they be on the head of Joseph, And on the crown of
the head of the one distinguished among his brothers.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis
49:22-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Regarding Jesus Christ, He is the Son of God. Church Age
believers are in union with Christ, therefore they are also the sons of God. Jesus
Christ came to this earth in His First Advent to be the Savior of the world. He
will return at the Second Advent to be the ruler of the entire earth for the
Millennium.  Jesus Christ died a spiritual death to pay for the sins of all
mankind. Psalms 22:1. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For the choir director; upon Aijeleth Hashshahar. A Psalm of
David. My God, my God, why have You forsaken me? Far from my deliverance are
the words of my groaning.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 22:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He then died physically after His atoning work on the
cross was complete by voluntarily dismissing His human spirit. He was the only
human being to ever be able to do so as part of God the Father’s plan.  Luke
23:46. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And Jesus, crying out with a loud voice, said, “Father, INTO
YOUR HANDS I COMMIT MY SPIRIT.” Having said this, He breathed His last.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Luke
23:46, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is now seated at right hand of the Father in
Heaven and He intercedes for each of us. Because all believers are in Christ
and share His position and future, we will also join Him upon our physical
death.</p>
