<h2>Fellowship</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Two of the most important things in the Christian life
are giving the Gospel to the unsaved and encouraging other believers to get
back into fellowship with the Lord. Your mental attitude is critical. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The right mental attitude is to first consider your own
spiritual condition by confirming you are in fellowship. Use 1 John 1:9 if in
doubt. Immediately upon confession of sin, you again have fellowship with God
which is the filling of the Holy Spirit also called spirituality. See category
on the <a href="#_D-Filling_of_the_1">Filling of the Holy Spirit</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You should also remember that you too have an old sin
nature. A part of your love for the Lord Jesus Christ is determined by your
attitude toward other believers. Gal. 6:1; John 8:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Brethren, even if anyone is caught in any trespass, you who
are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; each one looking
to yourself, so that you too will not be tempted.” (Galatians 6:1, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“But when they persisted in asking Him, He straightened up, and
said to them, &quot;He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to
throw a stone at her.&quot;” (John 8:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The wrong attitude is to have the mental attitude of
judging others by either their lifestyle or when you hear of them failing or
observe them failing. Luke 6:37.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Do not judge, and you will not be judged; and do not
condemn, and you will not be condemned; pardon, and you will be pardoned.”
(Luke 6:37, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Attitude of Forgetting Past Sins</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The attitude of forgetting past sins and failures is
illustrated in 2 Corinthians 2. Keep on moving forward in the spiritual life by
forgetting what lays behind. 2 Cor. 2:7-8; 2 Cor. 2:10-11; Phil. 3:13-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“so that on the contrary you should rather forgive and comfort
him, otherwise such a one might be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow. Wherefore I
urge you to reaffirm your love for him.” (2 Corinthians 2:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But one whom you forgive anything, I forgive also; for indeed
what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, I did it for your sakes in
the presence of Christ, so that no advantage would be taken of us by Satan, for
we are not ignorant of his schemes.” (2 Corinthians 2:10-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it
yet; but one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to
what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of
God in Christ Jesus.” (Philippians 3:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Attitude of Grace - Parable of the Unforgiving Servant
</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You cannot help another believer get back into fellowship
unless you have the mental attitude of grace and unconditional love toward them.
Do you have an attitude of grace and unconditional love toward other believers?
An attitude of grace is demonstrated in Matthew 18:23-26 with our Lord’s
illustration of the kingdom of heaven. The parable uses a time when a king wanted
to settle accounts with his slaves. At the time of Christ, a talent was a large
sum of money equal to 6,000 denarii, the largest unit of Roman currency at that
time. The denarius was equal to a typical day’s wages for unskilled labor. So
if one denarius was what a man like the unforgiving servant could earn in a
day, he would need to work 6,000 days or about 20 years to earn one talent. 10,000
talents would equal 60 million denarii or 60 million days of unskilled labor! </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Clearly, the slave could not possibly ever pay off the
debt. Everything would to be sold including his family being sold into slavery.
The servant begged for mercy and the king “felt compassion.” The slave did not deserve
anything, but the king forgave his debt as an act of grace - quite a bit to
forgive. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For this reason the kingdom of heaven may be compared to
a king who wished to settle accounts with his slaves. &quot;When he had begun
to settle them, one who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him.
&quot;But since he did not have the means to repay, his lord commanded him to
be sold, along with his wife and children and all that he had, and repayment to
be made. &quot;So the slave fell to the ground and prostrated himself before
him, saying, 'Have patience with me and I will repay you everything.'” (Matthew
18:23-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Later, the same servant found another believer who owed
him a 100 pence. A pence was equal to a denarius, so 100 pence at that time was
roughly equivalent to the wages for 100 days of unskilled labor. He started to
choke him and demanded payment. Matt. 18:28-30.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But that slave went out and found one of his fellow
slaves who owed him a hundred denarii; and he seized him and began to choke
him, saying, 'Pay back what you owe.' &quot;So his fellow slave fell to the
ground and began to plead with him, saying, 'Have patience with me and I will
repay you.' &quot;But he was unwilling and went and threw him in prison until
he should pay back what was owed.” (Matthew 18:28-30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When the king heard of this, he summoned the ungrateful
slave and handed him over to his torturers until the debt was repaid.
Obviously, the debt could never be repaid. Matt. 18:33-35.</p>

<p class=Verses>“'Should you not also have had mercy on your fellow slave, in
the same way that I had mercy on you?' &quot;And his lord, moved with anger,
handed him over to the torturers until he should repay all that was owed him.
&quot;My heavenly Father will also do the same to you, if each of you does not
forgive his brother from your heart.&quot;” (Matthew 18:33-35, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When we received the Lord Jesus Christ as our Savior, He paid
a debt for each of us that none can ever repay. He received the judgment of all
of the sins of mankind on the Cross. You cannot repay the price that He paid
for each of us. He’ll never penalize you again for your sins. This is a picture
of the servant being saved. We should not feel angry or resentful toward others
for an offense, real or imagined. We are commanded to forgive others in Ephesians
4:31-32. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander
be put away from you, along with all malice. Be kind to one another,
tender-hearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven
you.” (Ephesians 4:31-32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Attitude of Legalism or Grace – Parable of the
Prodigal Son </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 15:11-13, a man had two sons, both born-again.
They were in God’s family. Both were in fellowship with God and, therefore, both
received divine grace resources. The younger son sinned and got out of
fellowship. The elder son stayed at home in fellowship. But a peculiar thing
happened. The elder son thought that the younger son should get what he deserved
when he came back home to the father and do penance.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He said, &quot;A man had two sons. &quot;The younger of
them said to his father, 'Father, give me the share of the estate that falls to
me.' So he divided his wealth between them. &quot;And not many days later, the
younger son gathered everything together and went on a journey into a distant
country, and there he squandered his estate with loose living.” (Luke 15:11-13,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The younger son confessed his sins and decided to return
to his father and seek his forgiveness. He felt that he was not worthy to be his
father’s son because of his behavior. Was he still a son? Yes. The son’s father
demonstrates God’s attitude when a Christian confesses sin. His father showered
him with love. Luke 15:17-19. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But when he came to his senses, he said, 'How many of my
father's hired men have more than enough bread, but I am dying here with
hunger! 'I will get up and go to my father, and will say to him, &quot;Father,
I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight; I am no longer worthy to be
called your son; make me as one of your hired men.&quot;'” (Luke 15:17-19,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>So what did the father do? Put him in a coal mine
immediately? No. Some believers would like to see this happen when they observe
another believer sinning. They hope the other fails. Instead, the father
provided to his younger son his best robe, his signet ring that allowed him to
draw on the father’s account for money, and shoes which speaks of service -
again serving the Lord. Luke 15:20-22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;So he got up and came to his father. But while he was
still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion for him, and ran
and embraced him and kissed him. &quot;And the son said to him, 'Father, I have
sinned against heaven and in your sight; I am no longer worthy to be called
your son.' &quot;But the father said to his slaves, 'Quickly bring out the best
robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet;”
(Luke 15:20-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 15:23-24, “this son of mine was dead and has come
to life again” is the illustration of being out of fellowship with God and then
following confession of sin, being restored to fellowship. Now the elder
brother has been in fellowship. He has been doing a good job. This is probably
the greatest warning to faithful believers. Often the only way that Satan can
trip believers up is by getting their eyes on the other son, another believer.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and bring the fattened calf, kill it, and let us eat and
celebrate; for this son of mine was dead and has come to life again; he was
lost and has been found.' And they began to celebrate.” (Luke 15:23-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He keeps on asking, what do these things mean? Is he
delighted beyond measure that the younger son has come back? No! Luke 15:26.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;And he summoned one of the servants and began inquiring
what these things could be.” (Luke 15:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He became angry. He got out of fellowship when his old
legalism cropped up. He began to complain, grumble, and gossip. How did he know
that his brother had “devoured your wealth with prostitutes” when he went away
to a far country? He didn’t. He then began to malign. Luke 15:13; Luke
15:28-30.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;And not many days later, the younger son gathered
everything together and went on a journey into a distant country, and there he
squandered his estate with loose living.” (Luke 15:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But he became angry and was not willing to go in; and
his father came out and began pleading with him. &quot;But he answered and said
to his father, 'Look! For so many years I have been serving you and I have
never neglected a command of yours; and yet you have never given me a young
goat, so that I might celebrate with my friends; but when this son of yours
came, who has devoured your wealth with prostitutes, you killed the fattened
calf for him.'” (Luke 15:28-30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It was fitting to kill the fattened calf. The younger son
had returned to the father – a picture of the believer getting back into
fellowship. Luke 15:31-32.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;And he said to him, 'Son, you have always been with me,
and all that is mine is yours. 'But we had to celebrate and rejoice, for this
brother of yours was dead and has begun to live, and was lost and has been
found.'&quot;” (Luke 15:31-32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Be careful here. When another believer gets back into
fellowship, you may get out of fellowship and trade places with them. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Believer’s Ministry to Other Believers</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In James 5:19, “brethren” are members of the family of
God, Christians. “Strays from the truth” means to wander out of fellowship. “And
one” is another Christian in fellowship. “Turns him back” means to restore.</p>

<p class=Verses>“My brethren, if any among you strays from the truth and one
turns him back,” (James 5:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In James 5:20, “let him know” is the believer in
fellowship. “Turns a sinner” refers to restoring a believer from the sin they
are indulging in. “Save his soul from death” means deliver a soul from death
that is temporal death or being out of fellowship. “Will cover a multitude of
sins” means they confess their sins to God the Father, the sin is then covered
or cleansed. He is cleansed from all unrighteousness. 1 John 1:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error of his
way will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.” (James
5:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Conclusions</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Check your own attitude first. Consider the source and
realize that you also have an old sin nature and you must be in fellowship to
help another believer who is out of fellowship. Have an attitude of grace.
Remember that Christ forgave you a debt that you could never repay.  Don’t hold
a minor debt of another believer over their head. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Have an attitude of forgetting. Have an attitude of grace
over legalism. Don’t grudge a believer getting back into fellowship. Don’t hold
their past against them as did the prodigal son’s brother. There is a great
ministry in helping others to get back into fellowship.</p>
