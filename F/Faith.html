<h2>Faith</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Faith is a system of perception which accepts an
established criterion as  the basis of reality. This criterion is outside the
capability of the individual and is non-meritorious by nature. Believers have
the Bible in the original languages as the established criterion. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Faith is equivalent to confidence in the authority and
veracity of the source. For example, salvation gained only by faith that is
based on the authority and veracity of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Faith is the
only system of human perception that is non-meritorious. It is the basic system
of thinking of the human race. Eph. 2:8-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not
of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one
may boast.” (Ephesians 2:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Faith is the only system of perception that is compatible
with grace. In God's grace, Christ receives all of the merit. Since the Word of
God is the very mind of Christ, Bible doctrine has all of the merit, not how we
apply it to our lives. In application of Bible doctrine, God the Holy Spirit
has all of the merit because the spiritual life is empowered by the Holy
Spirit. 1 Cor. 2:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT
HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.” (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Your vocabulary is given to you by faith. Faith is also the
only system of perception that unlocks spiritual truths. Rationalism and
empiricism will not do it. 1 Cor. 1:18 through 1 Cor. 2:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are
perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.” (1
Corinthians 1:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom
did not come to know God, God was well-pleased through the foolishness of the
message preached to save those who believe.” (1 Corinthians 1:21, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“For I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus
Christ, and Him crucified. I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much
trembling, and my message and my preaching were not in persuasive words of
wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, so that your faith
would not rest on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God.” (1 Corinthians
2:2-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For to us God revealed them through the Spirit; for the Spirit
searches all things, even the depths of God. For who among men knows the
thoughts of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so the
thoughts of God no one knows except the Spirit of God.” (1 Corinthians 2:10-11,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Faith in its verb form “to believe” is <span lang=EL>πιστευ</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (pisteuō) and is a transitive verb that must have a subject
and an object. The whole merit of faith is in the object. Faith has a two-fold
object as far as relationship with God is concerned. In salvation, the object
of faith is the Lord Jesus Christ. Following salvation, the object of faith is
the Word of God, which gives us the mind of Christ whereby He is exalted. Acts
16:31; John 3:15; 1 Cor. 2:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“They said, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved,
you and your household.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 16:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“so that whoever believes will in Him have eternal life.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John
3:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT
HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.” (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All of the believing in the world secures nothing but
condemnation from God. However, one little bit of faith in the object of our
Lord Jesus Christ secures salvation. The efficacy of faith lies in the object
of faith. Faith is progressive in the Christian life as we grow spiritually,
but non-progressive in salvation. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/F/Faith%20and%20Grace%20Union.html">Faith and Grace Union</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Your mathematical ability was based on faith when you
learned that 2 + 2 = 4. Your geographical knowledge is often based on faith. Christians
wince when you call faith a system of thinking. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The word “heart” in the Bible does not emphasizing the
heart-pump, but emphasizes a system of perception. There is a head knowledge
that the Bible calls <i>gnosis </i>– the Greek word for knowledge. There is also
believed knowledge that the Bible calls <i>epignosis </i>– the Greek word for full
knowledge. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Faith is also a non-meritorious system of thinking and understanding
that involves volition. When you listen to the communication of Bible doctrine
while filled with the Holy Spirit, God the Holy Spirit teaches your human
spirit so you can comprehend the spiritual information. The Holy Spirit then
transfers that spiritually understood information to the left lobe of your soul
as <i>gnosis</i>. Now, you must believe that Bible doctrine to allow the Holy
Spirit to convert <i>gnosis</i> into <i>epignosis</i> and transfer it to the
right lobe of your soul also called the heart. This <i>epignosis</i> Bible
doctrine is now applicable to the situations and problems in life. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When people start rejecting the principle of faith
altogether as a system of perception, they get into problems. For example, it
takes a lot less faith to believe the biblical account of God and creation than
believing the unproven theory of evolution with all its stages and gaps.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Greek noun for faith is <span lang=EL>πίστις</span>
(pistis) and means to believe. The verb form to believe is <span lang=EL>πιστεύω</span>
(pisteuo). To believe in Christ, therefore is to have faith in Christ. To have
faith in Christ is to believe in Christ. Faith is the only means of entering God’s
plan of grace. Heb. 11:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction
of things not seen.” (Hebrews 11:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 11:1, “the assurance” is <span lang=EL>υ</span>̔<span
lang=EL>πο</span>́<span lang=EL>στασις</span> (hupostasis) in the Greek refers
to a contract by which you had agreed to abide by. Faith is a contract with God.
God promises to provide if you believe Him. God provides all of the grace
resources necessary for function in the Christian way of life. God provides
cleansing of all sin when you get out of line and name your known sins to God
the Father. 1 John 1:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 11:1, “hoped for” does not mean “I hope so.” In
the Greek, it is the present passive participle of <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span
lang=EL>λπι</span>́<span lang=EL>ζω</span> (elpizō) and refers to a reality, a
confidence and means “I know so” regarding our confidence in future things. We
receive confidence when we operate by faith and we learn by faith. Heaven
should be just as certain in your mind as the state or city where you now live.
Confidence means you know that you are going to heaven. That is your privilege
as a believer. A translation of Hebrews 11:1 is, “Now faith (non-meritorious
system of thinking) keeps on being the contract of things which we have not
seen but have absolute confidence.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Faith makes your salvation real and gives you confidence
in the spiritual life. You feed your faith with the Word. “The evidence of
things not seen” refers to faith ss the substance – the contract. Faith is the
evidence – a legal term that means proof or reality. “Things” is <span lang=EL>πρα</span>͂<span
lang=EL>γμα</span> (pragma) and refers to a transaction. “Not seen” is the
proof of transactions not observed.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A believer can use rationalism and empiricism in their
job in a bona fide way. Rationalism is the use of the mind and is an
intellectual approach.  Empiricism is the use of the senses to draw
conclusions. Neither rationalism nor empiricism ever reveal spiritual truth.
Spiritual IQ or the amount of <i>epignosis</i> in the soul is developed by
faith-transfer. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/G/Grace%20Apparatus%20For%20Perception.html">Grace Apparatus
for Perception</a>. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Eating and Drinking as a Picture of Faith </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Faith has no merit in and of itself. Eating has no merit
in and of itself. Drinking has no merit in and of itself. Just as everyone has
the ability to eat food and drink water, so everyone has the ability to be
saved. Ability is God doing the work. John 6:31-40; John 4:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall
never thirst; but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of
water springing up to eternal life.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 4:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All members of the human race (moral, immoral, and
religious) have faith. Faith in something or in people does not save. Only faith
in the substitutionary atoning work of Jesus Christ on the Cross saves! It is
always in the object of faith that does the work. For salvation, the Lord Jesus
Christ has already done all of the work and we believe in Christ’s
substitutionary spiritual death on the Cross for all of our sins for salvation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Everyone is saved exactly the same way. Using bread as an
analogy, once you eat the bread, (faith in the Lord Jesus Christ) the bread
(the Lord Jesus Christ) is inside you. Once you believe in Jesus Christ, Christ
is in you. John 14:20; John 6:48-59.</p>

<p class=Verses>““In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in
Me, and I in you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 14:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Development of Faith</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Faith is developed by using the Word of God. We exercise
faith by using faith-rest in everyday living. Using faith-patience in everyday
living is the faith in the <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine that makes up the
edification complex of our soul. Rom. 10:17; Heb. 4:1-3; James 1:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of
Christ.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 10:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, let us fear if, while a promise remains of entering
His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short of it. For indeed we have
had good news preached to us, just as they also; but the word they heard did
not profit them, because it was not united by faith in those who heard. For we
who have believed enter that rest, just as He has said, “AS I SWORE IN MY
WRATH, THEY SHALL NOT ENTER MY REST,” although His works were finished from the
foundation of the world.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 4:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(James
1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Faith is exercised in suffering. Faith is exercised in
the filling of the Holy Spirit. Faith is exercised in occupation with Christ.
The word “perfecter” in Hebrews 12:2 indicates that occupation with Christ
builds more or greater faith. 1 Peter 1:7-8; Gal. 5:22-23; Heb. 12:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“so that the proof of your faith, being more precious than gold
which is perishable, even though tested by fire, may be found to result in
praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ; and though you
have not seen Him, you love Him, and though you do not see Him now, but believe
in Him, you greatly rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Peter 1:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience,
kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things
there is no law.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Galatians 5:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith,
who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has
sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 12:2,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Faith is exercised in the application <i>epignosis</i> Bible
doctrine from the right lobe of the soul. Eph. 3:17-20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; and
that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all
the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the
love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled up to all the
fullness of God. Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly beyond all
that we ask or think, according to the power that works within us,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians
3:17-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Faith is exercised in spiritual maturity. 1 John 5:4-5;
Heb. 11:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For whatever is born of God overcomes the world; and this is
the victory that has overcome the world—our faith. Who is the one who overcomes
the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
John 5:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who
comes to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who
seek Him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 11:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The strongest faith of all is the faith reflected from
the edification complex of the soul of a spiritually mature believer. Col.
2:6-7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk
in Him, having been firmly rooted and now being built up in Him and established
in your faith, just as you were instructed, and overflowing with gratitude.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Colossians
2:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Measure of Faith </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Faith is thinking, making use of <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine,
and applying the Word of God from your soul’s frame of reference. Eph. 3-4;
Col. 1; Rom. 12:3; Rom. 12:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For through the grace given to me I say to everyone among you
not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think; but to think so as
to have sound judgment, as God has allotted to each a measure of faith.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
12:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Since we have gifts that differ according to the grace given
to us, each of us is to exercise them accordingly: if prophecy, according to
the proportion of his faith;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 12:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The content of what you are thinking is what gives faith
validity. Doctrine in the right lobe of the soul expresses itself through
faith. <i>Epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the soul is what gives faith
expression, power, animation, vigor, and inner beauty. There is no limit to the
amount of faith you can have, but your faith is no stronger than your doctrinal
content.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Faith merely expresses Bible doctrine. Faith becomes of
larger and larger caliber when Bible doctrine comes through it by expressing
itself and apply itself to various situations in life. Faith appropriates the
first point of Bible doctrine at the point of salvation, but the process is
reversed after you are saved. You need doctrine to give power to faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For the believer’s life to be meaningful, they must
depend upon the intake of Bible doctrine. When we stagger, we don’t lack faith,
but we lack the object of faith or the Word of God as <i>epignosis</i> Bible
doctrine applied to the situation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Faith Synonyms</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are number of synonyms found in the Scripture for
faith. The five listed below emphasize faith as non-meritorious. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Calls on the name of the Lord” in Joel 2:32, Acts 2:21,
and Romans 10:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>““And it will come about that whoever calls on the name of the
LORD Will be delivered; For on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem There will be those
who escape, As the LORD has said, Even among the survivors whom the LORD calls.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Joel
2:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“‘AND IT SHALL BE THAT EVERYONE WHO CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE
LORD WILL BE SAVED.’“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 2:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“for “WHOEVER WILL CALL ON THE NAME OF THE LORD WILL BE SAVED.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
10:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Eat and drink eat” in the communion service. 1 Cor.
11:24-26.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, “This is
My body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of Me.” In the same way He
took the cup also after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in My
blood; do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.” For as often
as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until He
comes.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 11:24-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Come.” Matt. 11:28.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Come to Me, all who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will
give you rest.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 11:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“As received Him” as receiving a gift. John 1:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to
become children of God, even to those who believe in His name,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John
1:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Heed the good news.” Rom. 10:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“However, they did not all heed the good news; for Isaiah says,
“LORD, WHO HAS BELIEVED OUR REPORT?”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 10:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You wi1l find that where salvation is being discussed,
the word “believe” is a synonym for faith in context. 1 John 5:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and
whoever loves the Father loves the child born of Him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 John 5:1,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Five Hebrew Words For Faith in the Old Testament</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 15:6, “faith” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>אמן</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>('âman) and is used primarily for salvation faith. <i>Aman</i>
means to use someone as a prop, a foundation, a crutch. Old Testament believers
were saved by faith in Jesus Christ. They knew Him then as Yahweh
(pronunciation of the tetragrammaton YHWH).</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then he believed in the LORD; and He reckoned it to him as
righteousness.” (Genesis 15:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalm 37:3-5 and in Psalm 91:2, “trust” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>בּטח</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(bâṭach) and is a wrestler’s term for a
body slam. It means taking a problem, a tragedy, a difficulty, a testing and
put it on the Lord, thereby slamming it down on Him.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Trust in the LORD and do good; Dwell in the land and cultivate
faithfulness.” (Psalms 37:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“I will say to the LORD, &quot;My refuge and my fortress, My
God, in whom I trust!&quot;” (Psalms 91:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalm 57:1, “takes refuge” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>חסה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(châsâh) and means to take or seek refuge and shelter.
This is like a rabbit being chased by a wolf, who jumps into a little crack in
the rock and where the wolf can’t get his nose in and therefore the rabbit is
safe. This is a grace concept whereby we are helpless, hopeless, useless and
weak, but we have God's grace resources. The crack in the rock is the provision
of Bible doctrine. Believers are to use faith-rest to apply doctrine to life’s
situations.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the choir director; set to Al-tashheth. A Mikhtam of
David, when he fled from Saul in the cave. Be gracious to me, O God, be
gracious to me, For my soul takes refuge in You; And in the shadow of Your
wings I will take refuge Until destruction passes by.” (Psalms 57:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Job 13:15, “hope” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>יחל</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(yâchal) and means to hurt badly and to have a faith
stronger than your hurt.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Though He slay me, I will hope in Him. Nevertheless I
will argue my ways before Him.” (Job 13:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Isaiah 40:31, “wait for” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>קָוָה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(qavah) a picture of a small thread being weaved
into a gigantic rope and refers to the faith of the mature believer. This is
faith intertwined with <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the soul and claiming
the promises of God.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Yet those who wait for the LORD Will gain new strength; They
will mount up with wings like eagles, They will run and not get tired, They
will walk and not become weary.” (Isaiah 40:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Examples of Faith </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><a name="_Faith,_Spiritual_Gift"></a>Hebrews 11 has a
simple outline of the definition of faith and the illustration of faith using
Old Testament believers to spotlight it. In Hebrews 11:2, “the men of old”
refers to Old Testament believers such as Abel, Noah, Abraham, etc. “Gained
approval” is the aorist passive indicative of <span lang=EL>μαρτυρε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (martureō) and means they made a good report in witnessing. The
constative aorist means they did this during their entire spiritual life and experience.
They received a “good report” from God. Since they operated by faith, they
pleased God. Without faith it is impossible to please God. Heb. 11:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For by it the men of old gained approval.” (Hebrews 11:2,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who
comes to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who
seek Him.” (Hebrews 11:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Faith and Belief of Abel</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Nearly everyone knows the story of Cain and Abel and how
Cain murdered his brother. Abel was a believer. In those days, animal
sacrifices were offered after salvation. This was a post-salvation experience
in the dispensation of the Age of the Gentiles. They were not saved by offering
animal sacrifices. They were saved by believing in Jesus Christ as Savior. Gen.
15:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then he believed in the LORD; and He reckoned it to him as
righteousness.” (Genesis 15:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Later, they were not saved by keeping the Mosaic Law. They
were saved by personal faith in Jesus Christ. Just like today, you are not
saved because you go to church, join a church, kick your tip into the kitty,
make the right clucking noises, or yield to some pressure scheme.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 11:4, “By faith Abel offered to God a better
sacrifice than Cain” means that through the means of faith, Abel was in
fellowship and exercising faith-rest which was the Old Testament form of spirituality.
</p>

<p class=Verses>“By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain,
through which he obtained the testimony that he was righteous, God testifying
about his gifts, and through faith, though he is dead, he still speaks.”
(Hebrews 11:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The faith in Hebrews 11:4 is the faith exercised after
salvation. This faith is non-meritorious thinking. The object of faith has the
merit, in the case of salvation in Jesus Christ. The faith method of perception
is necessary to understanding biblical creation. “Offered” is the aorist active
indicative of <span lang=EL>προσφε</span>́<span lang=EL>ρω</span> (prospherō)
and means to bring face to face with God with the reality of the proper use of
sacrifices. This is worship, a believer qualified to worship. “A better
sacrifice” means it was a better sacrifice than Cain’s sacrifice from God's
standpoint.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 11:4, “through which he obtained the
testimony” means that the animal sacrifice he performed was acceptable to God.
Why was it acceptable? He was a believer. Adam had instructed both Cain and
Abel in animal sacrifices. Abel had been saved and Cain had remained unsaved. The
difference between Abel’s sacrifice and that of Cain was belief versus unbelief.
This is the same today between Christianity and religion.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 11:4, “that he was righteous” means he was a
believer. He received God's very own righteousness at the point of salvation
and kept on having salvation. He also received God's eternal life at the moment
of salvation. He also received the imputation of God’s absolute righteousness (+R).
You have to be as righteous as God to live with Him forever. He must receive
forgiveness of sins committed after salvation. “God testifying about his gifts”
refers to the animal sacrifices and that they were biblical. “And through faith”
refers to the faith exercised by Abel in his animal sacrifice. “He still
speaks” means that although Abel is long dead, his faith keeps on speaking
through the Word of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Lack of Faith and Unbelief of Cain</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Cain was unsaved and to him a sacrifice was a sacrifice.
Abel was saved and knew that the animal sacrifice commemorated the blood of the
Cross, the fact of Jesus Christ would be judged for the sins of mankind. Cain
was trying to impress God with what he had done. He was a farmer, so he brought
produce to his sacrifice. This was probably apples, pomegranates, lemons,
potatoes, etc. The produce portrays the farming ability of Cain. Cain was relying
on human good and what he had done from his human nature and the old sin
nature. His produce was minus the blood sacrifice and this is what is being emphasized.
Gen. 4:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Again, she gave birth to his brother Abel. And Abel was a
keeper of flocks, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.” (Genesis 4:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is the difference between religion and Christianity.
Religion is what you can do for God whereas Christianity is what Christ did for
us. Religion has good people going to heaven and bad people probably not going
anywhere. Christianity provides for bad people going to heaven.  Religion
relies on human good of man and Christianity relies on the divine good based on
the person and work of Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Cain was a religious man and just like religion, he
started persecuting Truth right from the start. In the Genesis 4 account, Cain
was motivated by jealousy. The implications were that Cain refused to recognize
that he was a sinner, bankrupt, under a penalty, and that he was violating the
righteousness and justice of God. Abel recognized this.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Cain refused to recognize the curse of man. Religion
always denies this. Religion believes that all are righteous, that everyone has
some good in them (human good), and the universal brotherhood of man and
fatherhood of God. Man fell and is under a curse. Abel recognized this.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Cain refused God’s instruction and help. The implication
was that Cain didn’t feel he needed any  help from God and he could do
everything by himself. Abel followed the instructions of God and he relied on
God’s grace provisions. Cain followed an ego-centered operation where his ego
demanded that he show what he has done. He followed his mother Eve in this.
Abel followed God's instructions and relied on God. Gen. 3:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For God knows that in the day you eat from it your eyes
will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.&quot;”
(Genesis 3:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Cain wanted a cover, not a cure. This is what is always
true of religion. After the Fall, Adam and Eve felt they needed to cover
themselves instead of letting God provide. Our Lord chastised the legalism and
religiosity of the Pharisees in Matthew 23:27-28 and called them “whitewashed
tombs.” Gen. 3:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you
are like whitewashed tombs which on the outside appear beautiful, but inside
they are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness. &quot;So you, too,
outwardly appear righteous to men, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and
lawlessness.” (Matthew 23:27-28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that
they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loin
coverings.” (Genesis 3:7, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Cain preferred human viewpoint to divine viewpoint. Human
viewpoint has human opinions, rationalism, empiricism, and emotionalism. Abel
accepted divine viewpoint and lived by it. Human opinions are often good and
are looking for a better world. But they always flop because man’s opinions are
no better than man’s strength. Cain became a murderer. 1 John 3:11-15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this is the message which you have heard from the
beginning, that we should love one another; not as Cain, who was of the evil
one and slew his brother. And for what reason did he slay him? Because his
deeds were evil, and his brother's were righteous. Do not be surprised,
brethren, if the world hates you. We know that we have passed out of death into
life, because we love the brethren. He who does not love abides in death.
Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer; and you know that no murderer has
eternal life abiding in him.” (1 John 3:11-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are instructed to avoid the path of Cain. Jude 1:11; 1
John 3:11-12. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Woe to them! For they have gone the way of Cain, and for pay
they have rushed headlong into the error of Balaam, and perished in the
rebellion of Korah.” (Jude 1:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this is the message which you have heard from the
beginning, that we should love one another; not as Cain, who was of the evil
one and slew his brother. And for what reason did he slay him? Because his
deeds were evil, and his brother's were righteous.” (1 John 3:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Unsuccessful Search For Enoch</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Enoch didn’t die. He had maximum Bible doctrine in his
soul. He was a mature believer. Heb. 11:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“By faith Enoch was taken up so that he would not see death;
AND HE WAS NOT FOUND BECAUSE GOD TOOK HIM UP; for he obtained the witness that
before his being taken up he was pleasing to God.” (Hebrews 11:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When Enoch was 65 years old, he had a baby boy named
Methuselah who lived the longest in the Bible, 969 years. Why? Because of
different climactic conditions, different nutrition, strength of body, and
because God willed it. Why do you live as long as you live today? By the grace
of God among other things. Gen. 5:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Enoch lived sixty-five years, and became the father of
Methuselah.” (Genesis 5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Enoch “walked with God” and was translated at the age of
365. Gen. 5:23-24. </p>

<p class=Verses>“So all the days of Enoch were three hundred and sixty-five
years. Enoch walked with God; and he was not, for God took him.” (Genesis
5:23-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 5:24 “took” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>לקח</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(lâqach) in the Hebrew and means to take, to carry
away. In the Septuagint, “took” is the aorist passive indicative of <span
lang=EL>μετατι</span>́<span lang=EL>θημι</span> (metatithēmi) and means to
change and to transport, to translate. Enoch was transferred from earth to Paradise.
He was transferred without death physically. Why?</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 11:5, “see” is <span lang=EL>ο</span>̔<span
lang=EL>ρα</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (horaō) and means to see with the
eyes, to see with the mind, to perceive, to know, to see by experience. “And he
was not found” is the imperfect tense, passive voice of <span lang=EL>ευ</span>̔<span
lang=EL>ρι</span>́<span lang=EL>σκω</span> (heuriskō) and means he wasn’t
discovered, they continually searched but didn’t discover him. “Because God
took him up” Why? “He obtained the witness” is the perfect tense of <span
lang=EL>μαρτυρε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (martureō) and means to bear
witness, to give an honorable report. “He was pleasing to God” is the perfect
active infinitive of <span lang=EL>ευ</span>̓<span lang=EL>αρεστε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (euaresteō) and means to be totally pleased. Enoch was
translated to impress the antediluvian civilization with the faith-rest life.
He was a mature believer who lived by Bible doctrine and when he was translated,
transferred, they got the point! He lived by faith. This is what pleased God. </p>

<p class=Verses>“By faith Enoch was taken up so that he would not see death;
AND HE WAS NOT FOUND BECAUSE GOD TOOK HIM UP; for he obtained the witness that
before his being taken up he was pleasing to God.” (Hebrews 11:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 11:6, “And without faith” means that apart
from faith it is impossible. How is God real to us today? Only through Bible
doctrine in the right lobe of the soul in the frame of reference, memory
center, conscience and divine viewpoint.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is impossible to please God apart from using the
faith-rest life. To be in the plan of God and to come face to face with God in
the spiritual life, faith-rest is necessary. It is necessary to believe the
Word of God and claim His promises in Scripture. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who
comes to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who
seek Him.” (Hebrews 11:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God keeps on being a rewarder and a giver of grace to
those that apply <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine to their life. You cannot
pervert grace. God becomes a giver from the ultimate source of Himself. “To those
who seek him” means to investigate it thoroughly, to be positive to Bible
doctrine. Apart from Bible doctrine, it is impossible to love God, to seek God,
or to know God.</p>
