<h2><a name="_D-Faith_and_Grace"></a>Faith and Grace Union</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the Cross, faith responds to grace resulting in the
salvation of the one believing. This union results in a new spiritual birth.
Grace initiates with God’s plan through the person and work of Christ and faith
responds. Eph. 2:8-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not
of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one
may boast.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 2:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Grace is made only for faith. Using works instead of
faith, it would be a believer confessing their sins plus feeling sorry for
their sins plus vowing to never do them again plus asking forgiveness. The
result is lack of faith and therefore, lack of restoration to fellowship. These
are works which add to God’s grace application. Anything added to grace negates
grace. 1 John 1:9. </p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
John 1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Since faith is the only true responder to grace, faith
transfers <i>gnosis</i> (knowledge) in the mind (left lobe of the soul) to <i>epignosis</i>
(full knowledge) in the right lobe of the soul. Eph. 3:16-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory,
to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inner man, so that
Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; and that you, being rooted and
grounded in love,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 3:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Grace and Faith at the Cross</b> </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Grace and faith become one at the Cross. Therefore, they
must live together in this life. If you are born-again, then you have tasted
grace once in your life. Divorce is analogous to the believer switching to the
works concept, instead of the grace concept. Therefore, all other works
concepts of perception are excluded from grace.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Rationalism is the intellectual form of perception and
uses logic or an academic approach based on reason alone. Rationalism says that
reason is the source of knowledge and is superior and independent of any
sensory perception. Rationalism is a meritorious form of perception.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Empiricism in the scientific form of learning by
observation and experimentation. Empiricism feels that reality is in the
function of the senses as they relate to what is observed whereby all
information is relayed to the brain. Seeing is believing. Thomas used this
approach instead of faith toward the risen Christ in resurrection body. He felt
that if he could touch Christ, he would believe it really was Christ.
Empiricism, is a meritorious form of perception. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Faith is the way mankind begins all learning in life.
Faith is the only non-meritorious form of perception. Faith builds knowledge on
the basis of an absolute authority or axiom such as God exists or 1+1= 2. The
validity of faith depends on the object of that faith. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Spiritual Production From the Union of Grace and Faith</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The union of grace and faith at the Cross demands
production in the spiritual life. When grace and faith act on God's promises,
that produces full knowledge and God labels it as true lasting production or
divine good. The continual use of faith to God’s grace plan causes continual
intake and application of Bible doctrine in the Christian way of life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Therefore, the responder, which is faith, allows the Holy
Spirit to transfers that spiritual phenomena (<i>pneumatikos</i> in the Greek)
from the human spirit to the left lobe of the soul (the mind) as <i>gnosis</i>.
<i>Gnosis</i> (head knowledge) cannot by applied to produce spiritual
production or divine good. It must also be transferred by faith belief in that
divine truth whereby the Holy Spirit transfers it to the right lobe of the soul
where it becomes <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine. <i>Epignosis</i> (full
knowledge in the soul) is the only form that produces divine good. This
accumulation of <i>epignosis</i> doctrine leads to erection of the Edification
Complex of the Soul. Col. 1, Eph. 3, Eph. 4, 1 Cor. 1, 1 Cor. 2.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Doctrine is built on doctrine. <i>Epignosis</i> doctrine
in the soul is applied toward God and toward others. <i>Epignosis</i> gives
sight to the soul so we can see God with the eyes of faith. Learning Bible
doctrine cannot be done in your mind apart from the enabling ministry of God
the Holy Spirit. If it could be done in your mind apart from the grace of God,
you could use you human IQ to learn the spiritual things from God. This is
anti-grace. There is only one type of IQ in the Christian life and that is
Spiritual IQ that is <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the
soul. It is never your genius, your human ability, or your talent that matter.
It is God’s grace provision of the human spirit plus the enabling ministry of
God the Holy Spirit. This is the Grace Apparatus for Perception.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You can use your human mind under the filling of the
Spirit to do your job, if it calls for rationalism or empiricism. However, you
cannot use your human mind for anything like turning <i>gnosis</i> to <i>epignosis</i>.
Your human mind is only a staging area, a transfer area. You may have the
highest IQ in town and be the sorriest believer in the area.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Grace and Faith Union Illustrated by Love in Marriage</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Grace and faith are like the love between a man and a
woman. By analogy, just as there is only one man for one woman so then grace is
the only one for faith and faith is the only one for grace. Grace and faith are
united at the Cross by God’s design. Gen. 2:21-25. </p>

<p class=Verses>“So the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and
he slept; then He took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh at that place.
The LORD God fashioned into a woman the rib which He had taken from the man,
and brought her to the man. The man said, “This is now bone of my bones, And
flesh of my flesh; She shall be called Woman, Because she was taken out of Man.”
For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother, and be joined to
his wife; and they shall become one flesh. And the man and his wife were both
naked and were not ashamed.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis 2:21-25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has designed the right time for the man and his right
woman to meet. This is based on grace, not the “big search.” God has designed
the right place for grace and faith to meet and that place is the Cross. Just
as marriage is the framework of the love between a man and a woman, so the Cross
is the framework for grace and faith. 1 John 5:4-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For whatever is born of God overcomes the world; and this is
the victory that has overcome the world—our faith. Who is the one who overcomes
the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? This is the One
who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ; not with the water only, but with
the water and with the blood. It is the Spirit who testifies, because the
Spirit is the truth.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 John 5:4-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In marriage, the wife keeps on responding to her husband.
In the Christian way of life, faith keeps on responding to God's grace. You
were married on a faith principle and saved on a faith principle. You kept
enjoying marriage by faith and you keep on walking by faith. After you have
become a believer by faith in Christ, it is faith-rest, transferring <i>gnosis</i>
to <i>epignosis</i> in the soul by faith. Col. 2:6; 2 Cor. 5:7; Heb. 11:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk
in Him,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Colossians 2:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“for we walk by faith, not by sight—”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Corinthians
5:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who
comes to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who
seek Him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 11:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Faith excludes works or human merit. When you marry the
wrong woman, it can be hell on earth. That is exactly what happens when you
marry works. Adding anything to faith belief in Jesus Christ will not save.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Confessing sin with conditions won’t restore the filling
of the Holy Spirit resulting in no spiritual growth. Bringing works to grace
results in spiritual idiocy. The only thing you will understand is prophecy and
you will be cross-eyed spiritually. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The harem of works is human good or legalism and is the
works of the Law. Faith excludes works or human merit. For example, “believe
and be baptized” would be bringing a human work to salvation. It should be, “having
believed, be baptized.”  Gal. 2:16; Eph. 2:9; Titus 3:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“nevertheless knowing that a man is not justified by the works
of the Law but through faith in Christ Jesus, even we have believed in Christ
Jesus, so that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of
the Law; since by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Galatians
2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians
2:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done in
righteousness, but according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration and
renewing by the Holy Spirit,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Titus 3:5, NASB)</p>
