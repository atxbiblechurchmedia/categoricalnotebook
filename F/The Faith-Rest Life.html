<h2><a name="_D-The_Faith-Rest_Life"></a>The Faith-Rest Life</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Faith-Rest Life is knowing, believing, and applying
God's promises, principles, and doctrines of the Word to experience. Faith-rest
is related to the other basics of the spiritual life especially needful for the
new believer. Confessing sin biblically gets one back into fellowship with God.
The filling of the Holy Spirit keeps one in a state of fellowship or
spirituality. Faith-rest is maintaining one’s fellowship. Living in the Word is
growing in fellowship. Occupation with Christ is the expression of the believer
in fellowship.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Faith-rest is based on daily doctrinal intake and
application of <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine to experience. Faith-rest
produces steadiness while in fellowship. The central source for faith-rest for
the new believer and all believers is the Word of God as promises, principles
and doctrines. Isaiah 33:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He will be the stability of your times, A wealth of
salvation, wisdom and knowledge; The fear of the LORD is his treasure.&quot; 
(Isaiah 33:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Within Isaiah 33:6, we find the basic ingredients for
faith-rest. This verse in the Hebrew and Septuagint Greek clarifies the English
text. There are several factors needful for faith-rest - wisdom and knowledge.
Wisdom in the Hebrew can be translated “skill.” “Knowledge” in the Greek
Septuagint means “expert in knowledge and experiential in nature.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The faith-rest life begins with a maximum exposure to the
truth of the Word of God, but it must be applied to life. In Isaiah 33:6, the
central purpose of faith-rest is to bring steadiness into the believer’s life
of fellowship. “Of your times” means a continuing period of time, or time with
a durative quality. “Wealth of salvation” in the Hebrew means riches or
resources. The promises of the Word for the new believer are their riches.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ and received
salvation, it was based upon a promise of salvation. Many of the Scriptures
spell out this promise. When initial faith was exercised in the Lord Jesus
Christ, we received eternal life. Nowhere in the Word of God are we ever told
to stop believing. We continue to believe the promises of God. There are more
than 7,000 of them just for the believer in their Christian walk. Romans 8:28
is a promise as is 1 Peter 5:7. 1 Samuel 17:47 tells us that the battle is not
ours, but the Lord’s.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And we know that God causes all things to work together
for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His
purpose.&quot;  (Romans 8:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;casting all your anxiety on Him, because He cares for
you.&quot;  (1 Peter 5:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and that all this assembly may know that the LORD does
not deliver by sword or by spear; for the battle is the LORD'S and He will give
you into our hands.&quot;&quot;  (1 Samuel 17:47, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Claiming the promises of God while in fellowship promotes
spiritual growth and assures increasing stability. Your faith is developed in
three ways: By the Word of God, by the Holy Spirit, and by undeserved
suffering. Rom. 10:17; Gal. 5:22; 1 Peter 1:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of
Christ.&quot;  (Romans 10:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,
patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,&quot;  (Galatians 5:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;so that the proof of your faith, being more precious than
gold which is perishable, even though tested by fire, may be found to result in
praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ;&quot;  (1 Peter
1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>So your faith mixed with His promises equals inner peace,
rest, and stability. A believer cannot cope effectively with an outward
problem, if they are the problem themselves. A problem-minded, fearful,
cry-baby type of a believer cannot cope with some outward thorny problem. And
since they aren’t in fellowship and not claiming God's promises, they may
become irritable, or worry, or gripe, or even fall apart at the seams. Then
everyone around them is tense, not relaxed, and everyone soon becomes
miserable. God has provided faith-rest life to have perfect mental happiness.
It is based upon <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the soul and
its application to experience! </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 10:17, we find two more factors related
directly with the faith-rest life. The word for faith in the Greek is <span
lang=EL>πι</span>́<span lang=EL>στις</span> (pistis) and means the belief or
conviction which arises out of the act of believing. This verse is not
emphasizing the process of faith.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of
Christ.&quot;  (Romans 10:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Hearing” also doesn’t emphasize the procedure of hearing
though it is not excluded. It refers to the report. It is the Greek word <span
lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>κοη</span>́ (akoē) which refers to the report.
The point here is that faith, belief, and conviction arise out of the content
of the text, not from the enthusiasm of the communicator or some other method.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“The word of Christ” is a different Greek word than the
normal <i>logos</i>. This is <span lang=EL>ρ</span>̔<span lang=EL>η</span>͂<span
lang=EL>μα</span> (rhēma) and means words that are actually used in human
communication and spoken to man on earth. In other words, for people to have
faith, they must understand the Word of God in communication which is
understood.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Faith always has to have an object. At salvation, the
object of faith is Jesus Christ. In the faith-rest life, the object of faith is
the Word of God, its promises, principles and doctrines. For the new believer,
the promises of the Word of God are in focus. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Hebrews 4:1 indicates that a believer should fear
something. What? That they fail to understand and use faith-rest? This passage
and context assumes that most believers know nothing of the post-salvation
inner peace in daily living.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore, let us fear if, while a promise remains of
entering His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short of it.&quot; 
(Hebrews 4:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The central purpose of the faith-rest life is found in
Hebrews 4:2. This passage gives the basic mechanics for the faith-rest life
which is the mixing of the Word of God with faith. The Greek begins with a
perfect periphrastic which is very strong. It says that we have been
evangelized and still are. We are still being given the Word. The “good news
preached” should be translated “the word of the report” and refers to the body
of truth communicated to the generation of Israel in the wilderness.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For indeed we have had good news preached to us, just as
they also; but the word they heard did not profit them, because it was not
united by faith in those who heard.&quot;  (Hebrews 4:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Did not profit them” is in the aorist tense and means at
each point with all points brought together into a single point. “Not united”
is a perfect passive participle. A participle indicates a principle of life. It
was their practice to not mix what they heard in faith or with faith. The
perfect tense indicates that they had reached a point where this practice
reached a climax and thereafter continued as a rule or norm. The passive voice
indicated that the Word received this kind of action on their part. “Who heard”
is an aorist active participle, which means that the practice or principle of
hearing was a characteristic of them. This is an adjectival participle in the
Greek.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For indeed we have had good news preached to us, just as
they also; but the word they heard did not profit them, because it was not
united by faith in those who heard.&quot;  (Hebrews 4:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers in Paul’s day believed just as the Israelite
believers did who came out of Egypt. However, the Word of God taught to Israel
was rejected and they would not claim God's promises. They remained in
carnality due to lack of faith in God's Word and His promises, thus they had no
inner rest. The very people who were described as “those who heard the Word”
were the same ones who “was not united by faith.” The issue is not a mere
exposure to Bible doctrine or promises, but the mixing of faith with them, or
to put it simply, to believe them.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A corrected translation of Hebrews 4:3 is, “For we which
have believed (the promises) do enter into rest, as He said, as I have sworn in
my wrath, they shall certainly not enter into my rest.” </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For we who have believed enter that rest, just as He has
said, &quot;AS I SWORE IN MY WRATH, THEY SHALL NOT ENTER MY REST,&quot;
although His works were finished from the foundation of the world.&quot; 
(Hebrews 4:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Hebrews 4:4-8 speaks about the “sabbath” which is a word
meaning “rest” and is an illustration of using faith-rest. Every day is a
sabbath to us in the Church Age because of this inner peace.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For He has said somewhere concerning the seventh day:
&quot;AND GOD RESTED ON THE SEVENTH DAY FROM ALL HIS WORKS&quot;; and again in
this passage, &quot;THEY SHALL NOT ENTER MY REST.&quot; Therefore, since it
remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly had good news preached to
them failed to enter because of disobedience, He again fixes a certain day,
&quot;Today,&quot; saying through David after so long a time just as has been
said before, &quot;TODAY IF YOU HEAR HIS VOICE, DO NOT HARDEN YOUR
HEARTS.&quot; For if Joshua had given them rest, He would not have spoken of
another day after that.&quot;  (Hebrews 4:4-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Basis of the Faith-Rest Life</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The basis of faith-rest is Positional Truth – the top
circle of the illustration below. All Church Age believers are placed into
union with Jesus Christ by God the Holy Spirit at salvation (Baptism of the
Holy Spirit). This is permanent. The function of faith-rest is whenever the
believer is filled with the Holy Spirit and therefore, in fellowship with God –
the bottom circle. This can only be achieved by confessions of known sins to
God the Father using 1 John 1:9. Rom. 8:1; Rom. 14:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in
Christ Jesus.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 8:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But he who doubts is condemned if he eats, because his eating
is not from faith; and whatever is not from faith is sin.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
14:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses><img width=500 height=300 id="Picture 1"
src="The%20Faith-Rest%20Life.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Faith-rest is from perfect God. No human deed or work can
be added to perfect divine provision. Hence, the believer must cease from their
deeds, human good, and enter into a rest where they do no work – the Holy
Spirit does the work. Heb. 3:7 - Heb. 4:l6. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Take care, brethren, that there not be in any one of you an
evil, unbelieving heart that falls away from the living God. But encourage one
another day after day, as long as it is still called “Today,” so that none of
you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. For we have become partakers
of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our assurance firm until the end,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews
3:12-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And to whom did He swear that they would not enter His rest,
but to those who were disobedient? So we see that they were not able to enter
because of unbelief.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 3:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, let us fear if, while a promise remains of entering
His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short of it. For indeed we have
had good news preached to us, just as they also; but the word they heard did
not profit them, because it was not united by faith in those who heard. For we
who have believed enter that rest, just as He has said, “AS I SWORE IN MY
WRATH, THEY SHALL NOT ENTER MY REST,” although His works were finished from the
foundation of the world.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 4:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the one who has entered His rest has himself also rested
from his works, as God did from His. Therefore let us be diligent to enter that
rest, so that no one will fall, through following the same example of
disobedience.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 4:10-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any
two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of
both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the
heart.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore let us draw near with confidence to the throne of
grace, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews
4:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This requires faith, not works. Faith is the absence of
human merit. Merit is the object of faith. Under faith-rest, the object of
faith is Bible doctrine, principles, and God’s promises. Mechanically, these
doctrines, promises, and principles must be mixed with faith. Heb. 4:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, let us fear if, while a promise remains of entering
His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short of it. For indeed we have
had good news preached to us, just as they also; but the word they heard did
not profit them, because it was not united by faith in those who heard.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews
4:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Bible contains more than 7,000 of God’s promises for
use while the believer is on the earth. Here are a few. 1 Peter 5:7; Isaiah
41:10; Psalms 55:22; Psalms 56:3; Psalms 4:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“casting all your anxiety on Him, because He cares for you.” 
(1 Peter 5:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“‘Do not fear, for I am with you; Do not anxiously look about
you, for I am your God. I will strengthen you, surely I will help you, Surely I
will uphold you with My righteous right hand.’”  (Isaiah 41:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Cast your burden upon the LORD and He will sustain you; He
will never allow the righteous to be shaken.”  (Psalms 55:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“When I am afraid, I will put my trust in You.”  (Psalms 56:3,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“In peace I will both lie down and sleep, For You alone, O
LORD, make me to dwell in safety.”  (Psalms 4:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Therefore, get under the teaching of a communicator of
Bible doctrine who uses Isagogics, Categories, and Exegesis (I.C.E.). If one is
not available locally, get recordings of one who does. Develop discernment with
regard to pastor-teachers. Comprehend the Word via the human spirit and the
power of the Holy Spirit who transfers the comprehended doctrine to the left
lobe of the soul as <i>gnosis</i>. Faith-belief regarding that <i>gnosis</i>
doctrine allows the Holy Spirit to transfer it to the right lobe of the soul as
<i>epignosis</i> doctrine. This results in a doctrinal frame of reference
results in the recycling of <i>epignosis</i> now applicable to life’s
situations. Because of <i>epignosis</i> in the soul and the resultant frame of
reference, the Word of God can be applied toward God and man. Eph. 3:18-19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the
breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ which
surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians
3:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As the previous stages function through the filling of
the Spirit and the operation of faith, an inner spiritual building is
constructed – the Edification Complex of the Soul. Use of the Word thus gives
inner rest and the desire to study the Word more and more. We continue to find
that the Lord has provided everything we need. 1 Thess. 5:18; Phil. 1:6; Rom.
8:28; 1 Sam. 17:47.</p>

<p class=Verses>“in everything give thanks; for this is God’s will for you in
Christ Jesus.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Thessalonians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For I am confident of this very thing, that He who began a
good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Philippians
1:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And we know that God causes all things to work together for
good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
8:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and that all this assembly may know that the LORD does not
deliver by sword or by spear; for the battle is the LORD’S and He will give you
into our hands.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Samuel 17:47, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are to apply the “Essence of God” promises to any
situation. Heb. 3:7-19; Exodus 17; Num. 20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Take care, brethren, that there not be in any one of you an
evil, unbelieving heart that falls away from the living God. But encourage one
another day after day, as long as it is still called “Today,” so that none of
you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 3:12-13,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For the sovereignty of God, we can have faith-rest in His
perfect plan for each one of us. For the righteousness of God, God is perfect
goodness. Any trial that confronts you will be good for you. For the justice of
God, God’s plan for you is always fair. For the love of God, every situation is
in the realm of His perfect love for you. For the eternal life of God, His life
is shared through every experience. John 14:19. </p>

<p class=Verses>““After a little while the world will no longer see Me, but you
will see Me; because I live, you will live also.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 14:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For the omniscience of God, He knew about your trials and
suffering before they ever happened. For the omnipresence of God, He is
everywhere, therefore He is always with you. Matt. 28:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“teaching them to observe all that I commanded you; and lo, I
am with you always, even to the end of the age.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 28:20,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For the omnipotence of God, He has the power to do
whatever He wants to. For the immutability of God, He never changes His
thinking toward you. All of His characteristics remain the same all of the
time. For the veracity of God, He is the perfect truth, so what He says in His
Word is true, and what you apply in your life is true.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Mechanics of the Faith-Rest Life</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The mechanics of the faith-rest life and how to use it in
your spiritual life are given in Hebrews 3:5 through Hebrews 4:16. The
faith-rest life is based on promises, or a cluster of promises which is called
a Bible doctrine. In the right lobe of the soul, <i>epignosis</i> Bible
doctrine is stored in the frame of reference where God's promises become combined
into doctrines and are applied to the situations in life. Heb. 4:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any
two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of
both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the
heart.” (Hebrews 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The mechanics of the faith-rest life include exposure to
the promises of God, belief in the promises of God, and then relating the
promises of God to the areas of life to which they pertain. 1 Peter 5:7; Isaiah
41:10; Psalms 55:22; Psalms 56:3; Psalms 4:8; 1 Thess. 5:18; Phil. 1:6; Rom.

<p class=Verses>&quot;casting all your anxiety on Him, because He cares for
you.&quot;  (1 Peter 5:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;'Do not fear, for I am with you; Do not anxiously look
about you, for I am your God. I will strengthen you, surely I will help you,
Surely I will uphold you with My righteous right hand.'&quot;  (Isaiah 41:10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Cast your burden upon the LORD and He will sustain you;
He will never allow the righteous to be shaken.&quot;  (Psalms 55:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When I am afraid, I will put my trust in You.&quot; 
(Psalms 56:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;In peace I will both lie down and sleep, For You alone, O
LORD, make me to dwell in safety.&quot;  (Psalms 4:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;in everything give thanks; for this is God's will for you
in Christ Jesus.&quot;  (1 Thessalonians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; For I am confident of this very thing, that He who began
a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus.&quot; 
(Philippians 1:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And we know that God causes all things to work together
for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His
purpose.&quot;  (Romans 8:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and that all this assembly may know that the LORD does
not deliver by sword or by spear; for the battle is the LORD'S and He will give
you into our hands.&quot;&quot;  (1 Samuel 17:47, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Church Age is the intensified stage of the Angelic
Conflict and calls for additional grace provision. The universal ministry of
the filling of the Holy Spirit as the means of spirituality did not occur until
the Church Age. John 7:39; John 16:14; 1 Cor. 6:19-20; Gal. 5:16; Eph. 5:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But this He spoke of the Spirit, whom those who believed in
Him were to receive; for the Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not
yet glorified.” (John 7:39, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;He will glorify Me, for He will take of Mine and will
disclose it to you.” (John 16:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy
Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and that you are not your own?
For you have been bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body.” (1
Corinthians 6:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the
desire of the flesh.” (Galatians 5:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but
be filled with the Spirit,” (Ephesians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The faith-rest life is the basis of spiritual victory in
the Angelic Conflict and continues as a stability principle of the believer’s
spiritual life. Heb. 11:6; 1 John 5:4-5; 2 Cor. 5:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who
comes to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who
seek Him.” (Hebrews 11:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For whatever is born of God overcomes the world; and this is
the victory that has overcome the world—our faith. Who is the one who overcomes
the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?” (1 John 5:4-5,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“for we walk by faith, not by sight—” (2 Corinthians 5:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Claiming God's Promises</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One side of the coin is confessing sin biblically. The
other side is claiming the promises or utilizing the faith-rest life. This is
the technique of habitually claiming the promises of God with the resultant
inner peace and stability that God gives. It is a technique for believers only.
It has nothing to do with the power of positive thinking so prevalent today.
Key passages are Hebrews 3:7-4:16, Exodus 17, Numbers 20 and many other
passages.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The faith-rest life can be exercised in this way: “Since
all things work together for good, I know God has a plan for my life. Not
everything may be good, but it will work together for good. Taking this verse
by faith, I can cast my cares upon Him before they even happen and by faith
give thanks for every happenstance, good or bad (from my viewpoint) because of
His plan. After all, the battle is the Lord’s because He is faithful. I don’t
have the spirit of fear, because He gives power, love and sound mindedness when
I continue in fellowship believing His promises. My mental attitude is
stabilized by knowing that if God be for us, who can be against us? After all,
He did the big thing in saving me, how easily He can take care of daily living
through me.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Characteristics of Using Faith-Rest</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What are the results or characteristics of a believer who
in fellowship utilizes these promises? Look at Hebrews 4:9-16. The believer is
characterized by inner rest and by ceasing from your own particular brand of
“fleshly works.” Heb. 4:9-10. </p>

<p class=Verses>“So there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God. For the
one who has entered His rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did
from His.” (Hebrews 4:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer is characterized by diligence and by knowing
the Word. Heb. 4:11-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore let us be diligent to enter that rest, so that no
one will fall, through following the same example of disobedience. For the word
of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing
as far as the division of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able
to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.” (Hebrews 4:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer is characterized by being willing to live an
open life under the divine inspection and scrutiny of the Almighty. Heb. 4:13. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all
things are open and laid bare to the eyes of Him with whom we have to
do.&quot;  (Hebrews 4:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer is characterized by effective biblical
witnessing and by testing. Heb. 4:14-15. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed
through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. For
we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One
who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin.” (Hebrews
4:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer is characterized by biblical prayer where
faith-rest is the basis for dynamics in prayer. Matt. 21:22; Mark 11:25; Heb.
4:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;And all things you ask in prayer, believing, you will
receive.&quot;” (Matthew 21:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses> “&quot;Whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have
anything against anyone, so that your Father who is in heaven will also forgive
you your transgressions.” (Mark 11:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore let us draw near with confidence to the throne
of grace, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of
need.&quot;  (Hebrews 4:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The faith-rest life produces a relaxed mental attitude in
the believer’s soul plus freedom from mental attitude sins. Isaiah 26:3-4; Rom.
5:5; 1 Cor. 13; Gal. 5:22. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;The steadfast of mind You will keep in perfect peace,
Because he trusts in You. &quot;Trust in the LORD forever, For in GOD the LORD,
we have an everlasting Rock.” (Isaiah 26:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been
poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.”
(Romans 5:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience,
kindness, goodness, faithfulness,” (Galatians 5:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Faith-Rest in the Old Testament</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Faith-rest was the basic system of spirituality among the
Old Testament saints. Old Testament saints did not have the indwelling of
Christ or the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. They were never commanded to be
filled with the Holy Spirit or to walk in the Spirit. Hab. 2:4; Heb. 11; Rom.
4:17-21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Behold, as for the proud one, His soul is not right
within him; But the righteous will live by his faith.” (Habakkuk 2:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Without becoming weak in faith he contemplated his own body,
now as good as dead since he was about a hundred years old, and the deadness of
Sarah's womb; yet, with respect to the promise of God, he did not waver in
unbelief but grew strong in faith, giving glory to God,” (Romans 4:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Holy Spirit regenerated in the Old Testament. The
Holy Spirit helped (called enduement) certain groups of people - kings,
craftsmen, prophets or writers of the Old Testament. Heb. 11:5-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“By faith Enoch was taken up so that he would not see death;
AND HE WAS NOT FOUND BECAUSE GOD TOOK HIM UP; for he obtained the witness that
before his being taken up he was pleasing to God. And without faith it is
impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is and
that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him.” (Hebrews 11:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Faith-rest produced a relaxed mental attitude. Isaiah
26:3-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;The steadfast of mind You will keep in perfect peace,
Because he trusts in You. &quot;Trust in the LORD forever, For in GOD the LORD,
we have an everlasting Rock.” (Isaiah 26:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><a name="_The_Faith-Rest_Life"></a><b>Examples of Not
Using Faith-Rest </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Israelites of the Exodus generation illustrate
believers who did not use the faith-rest life where they failed to claim the
promises of God. The Israelites had a lot of water problems. First they had too
much water called the Red Sea, then they had the wrong kind of water at Marah
where the bitter waters were made sweet, and then they had no water in the
desert in Exodus 17 and Numbers 20. God had given the Israelites all kinds of
promises. Exodus 14:13-14, says to not fear and stand still and see the
deliverance of the Lord from the Egyptian army bearing down on them. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But Moses said to the people, &quot;Do not fear! Stand by
and see the salvation of the LORD which He will accomplish for you today; for
the Egyptians whom you have seen today, you will never see them again forever.
&quot;The LORD will fight for you while you keep silent.&quot;&quot;  (Exodus
14:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They were terrified. They were told by Moses to get back
in fellowship and “stand still” mentally, that is to let the promises of God
carry them through. They could no nothing to save themselves from the Egyptian
army. Later on, the second generation of Israel would be marvelous soldiers,
for out of faith-rest comes divine viewpoint and divine guidance. But no one is
effective if they are torn up on the inside with fear and lack of trust in God.
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The conclusion of the Hebrews 3:7-18 passage is that not
claiming the promises of God in the spiritual life causes hardness of heart or
emotional revolt of the soul in the believer. In this passage, believers are
admonished to hear the Word of God. Israel is used as an example. Instead of
believing that God could accomplish what He had promised, they griped constantly.
Provocation refers to the griping of the Israelites in the desert.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore, just as the Holy Spirit says, &quot;TODAY IF
YOU HEAR HIS VOICE, DO NOT HARDEN YOUR HEARTS AS WHEN THEY PROVOKED ME, AS IN
THE DAY OF TRIAL IN THE WILDERNESS, WHERE YOUR FATHERS TRIED Me BY TESTING Me,
AND SAW MY WORKS FOR FORTY YEARS. &quot;THEREFORE I WAS ANGRY WITH THIS
GENERATION, AND SAID, 'THEY ALWAYS GO ASTRAY IN THEIR HEART, AND THEY DID NOT
KNOW MY WAYS'; AS I SWORE IN MY WRATH, 'THEY SHALL NOT ENTER MY REST.'&quot;
Take care, brethren, that there not be in any one of you an evil, unbelieving
heart that falls away from the living God. But encourage one another day after
day, as long as it is still called &quot;Today,&quot; so that none of you will
be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. For we have become partakers of
Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our assurance firm until the end,
while it is said, &quot;TODAY IF YOU HEAR HIS VOICE, DO NOT HARDEN YOUR HEARTS,
AS WHEN THEY PROVOKED ME.&quot; For who provoked Him when they had heard?
Indeed, did not all those who came out of Egypt led by Moses? And with whom was
He angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell
in the wilderness? And to whom did He swear that they would not enter His rest,
but to those who were disobedient?&quot;  (Hebrews 3:7-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Shockingly, a believer can have “an evil heart of
unbelief” regarding the Word of God and His promises. This type of believer is
always unproductive and never grows properly. According to Hebrews 3:13, the
faith-rest life should be taught daily, just as you emphasize the plan of
salvation daily.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But encourage one another day after day, as long as it is
still called &quot;Today,&quot; so that none of you will be hardened by the
deceitfulness of sin.” (Hebrews 3:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Daily Fuel of God’s Promises for the Faith-Rest Life</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Daily fuel for the faith-rest life is claiming God's
promises instead of worrying about everything! Upon rising in the morning and
through the day, apply the following promises. The Christian life can become
wonderful by using these promises consistently and faithfully. You’ll be glad
you did. Rom. 8:28; 1 Peter 5:7; 1 Thess. 5:18; 1 Sam. 17:47; 1 Cor. 1:9; 2 Tim.
1:7; Matt. 21:22; Phil. 4:19; Exodus 14:13-14; Psalms 4:8; Psalms 56:3; Isaiah
40:31; Isaiah 26:3; Isaiah 41:10; Rom. 8:31; Rom. 8:32.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And we know that God causes all things to work together
for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His
purpose.&quot;  (Romans 8:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;casting all your anxiety on Him, because He cares for
you.&quot;  (1 Peter 5:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;in everything give thanks; for this is God's will for you
in Christ Jesus.&quot;  (1 Thessalonians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and that all this assembly may know that the LORD does
not deliver by sword or by spear; for the battle is the LORD'S and He will give
you into our hands.&quot;&quot;  (1 Samuel 17:47, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;God is faithful, through whom you were called into
fellowship with His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of
power and love and discipline.&quot;  (2 Timothy 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;And all things you ask in prayer, believing, you
will receive.&quot; &quot;  (Matthew 21:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And my God will supply all your needs according to His
riches in glory in Christ Jesus.&quot;  (Philippians 4:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But Moses said to the people, &quot;Do not fear! Stand by
and see the salvation of the LORD which He will accomplish for you today; for
the Egyptians whom you have seen today, you will never see them again forever.
&quot;The LORD will fight for you while you keep silent.&quot;&quot;  (Exodus
14:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;In peace I will both lie down and sleep, For You alone, O
LORD, make me to dwell in safety.&quot;  (Psalms 4:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When I am afraid, I will put my trust in You.&quot; 
(Psalms 56:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Yet those who wait for the LORD Will gain new strength;
They will mount up with wings like eagles, They will run and not get tired,
They will walk and not become weary.&quot;  (Isaiah 40:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;The steadfast of mind You will keep in perfect
peace, Because he trusts in You.&quot;  (Isaiah 26:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;'Do not fear, for I am with you; Do not anxiously look
about you, for I am your God. I will strengthen you, surely I will help you,
Surely I will uphold you with My righteous right hand.'&quot;  (Isaiah 41:10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us,
who is against us?&quot;  (Romans 8:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him over
for us all, how will He not also with Him freely give us all things?&quot; 
(Romans 8:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Remember that according to Romans 12:2, the mind needs to
be renewed or renovated. The process of renewal involves the intake of the Word
of God. In other words, how is the printed Word of God converted to usable,
applicable Bible doctrine in my life? As the Word of God is communicated to the
positive believer by a pastor-teacher, the Holy Spirit transfers that
information to the human spirit which makes it spiritually understood. The Holy
Spirit then transfers that spiritual information to the left lobe (the mind) of
the soul (<i>nous</i> in the Greek) as <i>gnosis</i> or head knowledge. Head
knowledge in the believer is not applicable or usable in the spiritual life.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by
the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that
which is good and acceptable and perfect.” (Romans 12:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>However, the believer’s positive faith belief causes the
Holy Spirit to transfer head knowledge in the mind (<i>gnosis</i>) to full
knowledge (<i>epignosis</i>) in the right lobe of the soul. This faith-believed
knowledge is now usable in the Christian walk. The believed Word of God then
circulates in the right lobe of the soul (the heart) which is the authority of
the soul. The believer thus is matured and stabilized as they continue to take
in the Word. The believer’s thinking is thus being renewed. Rom. 3:12, Titus 3:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed
by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is,
that which is good and acceptable and perfect.&quot;  (Romans 12:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done
in righteousness, but according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration
and renewing by the Holy Spirit,&quot;  (Titus 3:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The renewing of the mind is the constant process of
taking in the facts of the Word while in fellowship and believing them by
faith. The circulation of the Word (<i>epignosis</i>) in the right lobe of the
soul draws in more spiritually factual information into the left lobe (the
mind) and the process keeps on repeating itself. So, the Christian life is much
more than having a verse for the year, or a life verse. This is habitually claiming
and using God's promises. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Take the promise verses listed above each morning and
review them while you are getting up. Since all things work together for good
for every believer who loves the Lord, I can cast all my cares upon Him.
Remember that not all things will immediately appear to be good. Certainly,
something is your life may be quite irritating when it happens, but it will
work together for good if you remain in fellowship applying the <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine in your soul to the situation. You can thank God for every
detail of the day before it ever gets underway because after all God is
faithful, the battle is the Lord’s and if God be for you, who can be against
you?</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This mental attitude of divine viewpoint brings mental
stability under the most trying of circumstances. Nothing can illustrate it
more vividly in my life personally than the events of September 21, 1966. On
that day at approximately 3:40 p.m. our stalwart son David, soon to be six
years of age was struck by an automobile and died four hours later. His trip
that day from school to his earthly home ended with arrival at his heavenly
home with the Lord he loved.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To show how the Lord sustains, I have taken the liberty
of quoting several passages of the “David Braun Memorial Letter” to show how
the Lord prepared us for that day. The Lord has used this event to win many
souls to Himself and we have never doubted for one minute the will of God in
the entire situation. Here is part of the letter.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Wednesday, September 21, 1966 started out as many
Nebraska mornings do, bright and sunny, an Indian summer day. Immediately after
arising, my wife claimed some verses, among them “This is the day the Lord hath
made, we will be glad and rejoice in it.” She, in her early morning devotions,
had again told the Lord that whatever His will was that day for Him to perform
it. I too was claiming verses in the early morning, for this is the habit of my
life also. Since “all things work together for good” we can “cast our every
care on Him.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Because of this provision, we gave “thanks for
everything” that would happen that day because after all “God is faithful” and
“the battle is the Lord’s.” And the attitude was, “If God be for us, who can be
against us?” Of course, we did not know that our David would be going to be
with the Lord later in the day.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>That morning for our devotions we quoted passages of
Scripture as was our custom. We quoted Psalm 34:1-4 and also 2 Timothy 3:14-17.
We usually quote Ephesians 6:1-4 and other passages of Scripture at all our
meals. The 2 Timothy passage was known thoroughly by David and was so
applicable to his life.</p>

<p class=Verses>“A Psalm of David when he feigned madness before Abimelech, who
drove him away and he departed. I will bless the LORD at all times; His praise
shall continually be in my mouth. My soul will make its boast in the LORD; The
humble will hear it and rejoice. O magnify the LORD with me, And let us exalt
His name together. I sought the LORD, and He answered me, And delivered me from
all my fears.” (Psalms 34:1-4, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“You, however, continue in the things you have learned and
become convinced of, knowing from whom you have learned them, and that from
childhood you have known the sacred writings which are able to give you the
wisdom that leads to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. All
Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for
correction, for training in righteousness; so that the man of God may be
adequate, equipped for every good work.” (2 Timothy 3:14-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.
HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER (which is the first commandment with a promise),
SO THAT IT MAY BE WELL WITH YOU, AND THAT YOU MAY LIVE LONG ON THE EARTH.
Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the
discipline and instruction of the Lord.” (Ephesians 6:1-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Before David had reached his third year, he knew 50 or so
verses by heart and just before he turned his third year, he had very
wondrously accepted Christ as His personal Savior. The Lord sustained us
through it all and continues to do so. Under one of the most fiery trials of
life, His grace was real and His stability was right there because of His
promises.</p>
