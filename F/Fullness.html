<h2><a name="_D-Fullness"></a><a name="_Fullness"></a>Fullness</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Fullness is defined as the state or quality of being full
or filled, the state of abounding, abundance, completeness.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Fullness of the Time</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fullness of the time was characterized by a maximum
amount of illness and a minimum amount of Satanic miracles. So Christ’s
miracles involving healing was effective to the maximum. In Galatians 4:4-5,
“fullness” is <span lang=EL>πλη</span>́<span lang=EL>ρωμα</span> (plērōma)
and means that which has been filled, that which fills, completeness, complete
or fullness of time, fullness in the sense of fulfillment, abundance.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His
Son, born of a woman, born under the Law, so that He might redeem those who
were under the Law, that we might receive the adoption as sons.” (Galatians
4:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Time” was God’s perfect timing for the Messiah, Jesus
Christ to arrive on earth and to die spiritually for the sins of mankind. From
the very beginning, after Adam and Eve’s fall in the Garden, God promised that
one day the seed of the woman would come. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And I will put enmity Between you and the woman, And between
your seed and her seed; He shall bruise you on the head, And you shall bruise
him on the heel.&quot;” (Genesis 3:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Genesis 3:15 predicted that Satan would bruise the heel
of the seed of the woman. Bruising the heel indicates a serious injury and one
of terrible suffering. When Christ went to the Cross and paid the penalty for
the sins of mankind, this was the fulfillment of Satan bruising the heel of the
seed of the woman. However, at the same time, Christ bruised Satan’s head,
which meant that Christ dealt Satan a fatal blow, destroying and defeating him
at the Cross.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Galatians 4:4, “God sent forth” is in the aorist tense
and refers to a point in time when God the Father sent God the Son on a mission
– to bring salvation to mankind. “His Son” means His adult son (deity). “Born
of a woman” is Jesus Christ taking on Himself the form of true humanity so that
we might receive adoption.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Born under the law” refers to being born a Jew under the
authority of the Mosaic Law. The humanity of Jesus Christ was subject to the
Law. Jesus Christ fulfilled the Law perfectly. Believers of the Church Age are
not subject to the Law. However, the Law is fulfilled when the believer walks
in fellowship. Matt. 5:17; Rom. 10:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the
Prophets; I did not come to abolish but to fulfill.” (Matthew 5:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone
who believes.” (Romans 10:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord’s arrival on earth was the perfect time in that
the Roman occupation of Palestine provided stable conditions for our Lord’s
ministry. It provided police protection. The crowds that followed Him caused a
minimum amount of killing, harassment, etc. It provided good communication for
that day. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Fullness of the Times</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ephesians 1:10, “fullness” is also <span lang=EL>πλη</span>́<span
lang=EL>ρωμα</span> (plērōma) and “times” refers to the Church Age. Every
believer in the Church Age is provided grace resources and blessings from God
beyond those provided in any previous dispensation. </p>

<p class=Verses>“with a view to an administration suitable to the fullness of
the times, that is, the summing up of all things in Christ, things in the
heavens and things on the earth. In Him” (Ephesians 1:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Fullness of Him</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ephesians 1:23, the “fullness of Him” refers to the
filling of the Holy Spirit who empowers the Church Age believer’s spiritual
life that results in spiritual maturity. </p>

<p class=Verses>“which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all.”
(Ephesians 1:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Fullness of the Gentiles</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The “times of the Gentiles” in Luke 21:24 and “fullness
of the Gentiles” in Romans 11:25 refer to the dispensation of the Church Age.
Until the Church Age is completed, there will be no reforming or regathering of
the remnant of Israel. This will occur in the dispensation of the Tribulation
following the Rapture of the Church. </p>

<p class=Verses>“and they will fall by the edge of the sword, and will be led
captive into all the nations; and Jerusalem will be trampled under foot by the
Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.” (Luke 21:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For I do not want you, brethren, to be uninformed of this
mystery—so that you will not be wise in your own estimation—that a partial
hardening has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come
in;” (Romans 11:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Fullness of Deity, Fullness of God</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Colossians 2:9-10, “the fullness of Deity” and in Ephesians
3:19 the “fullness of God” both refer to God the Holy Spirit who indwells every
Church Age believer. “Made complete” is <span lang=EL>πληρο</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (plēroō) and means to make full, to fill up, to cause to
abound, to furnish or supply liberally. We are filled with the Holy Spirit when
we are in fellowship with God following confessions of sin. We are “made
complete” through the ministry of God the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For in Him all the fullness of Deity dwells in bodily form,
and in Him you have been made complete, and He is the head over all rule and
authority;” (Colossians 2:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that
you may be filled up to all the fullness of God.” (Ephesians 3:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Colossians 1:19, “all the fullness” is also <span
lang=EL>πλη</span>́<span lang=EL>ρωμα</span> (plērōma) and refers to the
humanity of Jesus Christ living the spiritual life in hypostatic union with the
deity of God the Son. This first use of this unique spiritual life became the
universal spiritual life for every believer in the Church Age.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For it was the Father's good pleasure for all the fullness to
dwell in Him,” (Colossians 1:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Fullness of Christ</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the dispensation of the Church Age, every believer is
given the opportunity and God's grace provision to advance to spiritual
maturity - “the fullness of Christ.” Eph. 4:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the
knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature
which belongs to the fullness of Christ.” (Ephesians 4:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Since we have the same spiritual life that our Lord had,
we have the opportunity of executing God’s plan to achieve the fullness of
Christ. Our Lord set the standard when He lived the unique spiritual life
during His First Advent. Using the enabling power of the Holy Spirit and
applying the <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in His soul, our Lord quickly grew
to spiritual maturity.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>His Fullness</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 1:15-16, “His fullness” refers to royalty and the
Church Age.  John 1:16 is the transition when ritual is out and the reality of
the plan of God is in. “Grace upon grace” means that God's grace resources in
the Church Age with the enabling power of the Holy Spirit enable every believer
to fulfill the plan of God for their lives. </p>

<p class=Verses>“John testified about Him and cried out, saying, &quot;This was
He of whom I said, 'He who comes after me has a higher rank than I, for He
existed before me.'&quot; For of His fullness we have all received, and grace
upon grace.” (John 1:15-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Fulfillment</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 11:12, “fulfillment” refers to the Church Age as
the dispensation where all believers, both Jews and Gentiles, have both the
opportunity and God's grace provisions to fulfill the plan of God for their
lives. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Now if their transgression is riches for the world and their
failure is riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their fulfillment be!”
(Romans 11:12, NASB)</p>
