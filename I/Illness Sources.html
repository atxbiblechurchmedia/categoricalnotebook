<h2>Illness Sources</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are three major sources of illness – physiological,
psychosomatic, and demon-induced illness. Physiological illness is a physical
illness or organic disease. Psychosomatic illness is a mental illness. Demon-induced
illness is when demons possess unbelievers where they can produce certain kinds
of diseases. Satan and or demons are also permitted by God at times to affect
believers health from the outside. However, no believer can be indwelt by a
demon because their bodies are already indwelt by God the Holy Spirit, Jesus
Christ as the Shekinah Glory, and by God the Father. See category on <a
href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/I/Indwelling%20of%20the%20Trinity.html">Indwelling of the Trinity</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Demon-Induced Illness</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Demons can bring on illness and malfunction. Matt. 12:22;
Luke 13:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute was brought
to Jesus, and He healed him, so that the mute man spoke and saw.” (Matthew
12:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;And this woman, a daughter of Abraham as she is, whom
Satan has bound for eighteen long years, should she not have been released from
this bond on the Sabbath day?&quot;” (Luke 13:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Rarely, some types of deafness, dumbness, and paralysis
can be caused by demon possession. Matt. 9:32-33; Mark 5:5; Mark 9:17-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“As they were going out, a mute, demon-possessed man was
brought to Him. After the demon was cast out, the mute man spoke; and the
crowds were amazed, and were saying, &quot;Nothing like this has ever been seen
in Israel.&quot;” (Matthew 9:32-33, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Constantly, night and day, he was screaming among the tombs
and in the mountains, and gashing himself with stones.” (Mark 5:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And one of the crowd answered Him, &quot;Teacher, I brought
You my son, possessed with a spirit which makes him mute; and whenever it
seizes him, it slams him to the ground and he foams at the mouth, and grinds
his teeth and stiffens out. I told Your disciples to cast it out, and they
could not do it.&quot;” (Mark 9:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When a demon causes an illness or disease, removal of the
demon causes an instant cure. This is termed healing in Matthew 10:1, Mark
6:13, Acts 8:7, Mark 1:32-34, and Acts 19:12. In cases where demon possession
did not cause illness, they are just cast out without mention of healing.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Jesus summoned His twelve disciples and gave them authority
over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every kind of disease and
every kind of sickness.” (Matthew 10:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And they were casting out many demons and were anointing with
oil many sick people and healing them.” (Mark 6:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For in the case of many who had unclean spirits, they were
coming out of them shouting with a loud voice; and many who had been paralyzed
and lame were healed.” (Acts 8:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“When evening came, after the sun had set, they began bringing
to Him all who were ill and those who were demon-possessed. And the whole city
had gathered at the door. And He healed many who were ill with various
diseases, and cast out many demons; and He was not permitting the demons to
speak, because they knew who He was.” (Mark 1:32-34, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“so that handkerchiefs or aprons were even carried from his
body to the sick, and the diseases left them and the evil spirits went out.”
(Acts 19:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Satan as a Source of Illness </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Through demon possession, Satan uses demons to produce certain
abnormal activities. Satan blinds through religion. Satan, if allowed by God,
can remove someone from authority and also cause a shortened life. Psalms 109:7;
Psalms 109:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“When he is judged, let him come forth guilty, And let his
prayer become sin.” (Psalms 109:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Let his days be few; Let another take his office.” (Psalms
109:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan can be allowed by God to administer the sin unto
death. 1 Cor. 5:5; 1 Tim. 1:19-20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I have decided to deliver such a one to Satan for the
destruction of his flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the
Lord Jesus.” (1 Corinthians 5:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“keeping faith and a good conscience, which some have rejected
and suffered shipwreck in regard to their faith. Among these are Hymenaeus and
Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan, so that they will be taught not to
blaspheme.” (1 Timothy 1:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan has the power of death, when allowed by God. Psalms
109:9; Heb. 2:14-15. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Let his children be fatherless And his wife a widow.” (Psalms
109:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood, He
Himself likewise also partook of the same, that through death He might render
powerless him who had the power of death, that is, the devil, and might free
those who through fear of death were subject to slavery all their lives.”
(Hebrews 2:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan is a murderer. John 8:44; 1 John 3:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the
desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not
stand in the truth because there is no truth in him. Whenever he speaks a lie,
he speaks from his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies.” (John
8:44, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“not as Cain, who was of the evil one and slew his brother. And
for what reason did he slay him? Because his deeds were evil, and his brother's
were righteous.” (1 John 3:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan was allowed by God to cause the death of Job’s ten
children. Job 1:12; Job 1:18-19. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD said to Satan, &quot;Behold, all that he has is
in your power, only do not put forth your hand on him.&quot; So Satan departed
from the presence of the LORD.” (Job 1:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“While he was still speaking, another also came and said,
&quot;Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their
oldest brother's house, and behold, a great wind came from across the
wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young
people and they died, and I alone have escaped to tell you.&quot;” (Job
1:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan was permitted by God to produce Job’s illness since
Job was a believer. Job 2:6-8. </p>

<p class=Verses>“So the LORD said to Satan, &quot;Behold, he is in your power,
only spare his life.&quot; Then Satan went out from the presence of the LORD
and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot to the crown of his
head. And he took a potsherd to scrape himself while he was sitting among the
ashes.” (Job 2:6-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan persecutes children and he can remove wealth. Psalms
109:10-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Let his children wander about and beg; And let them seek
sustenance far from their ruined homes. Let the creditor seize all that he has,
And let strangers plunder the product of his labor.” (Psalms 109:10-11, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan can turn everyone against a person. Satan can cut
off posterity to the next generation. Psalms 109:12-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Let there be none to extend lovingkindness to him, Nor any to
be gracious to his fatherless children. Let his posterity be cut off; In a
following generation let their name be blotted out.” (Psalms 109:12-13, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan uses demons to produce certain disease in
individuals. In Luke 13:16, the cause of this woman’s disease was demon
possession. The doctors could not heal her because she was bound by Satan.
Doctors today are baffled by demon-induced illness. This is not a passage
against doctors! Christ healed the woman. In cases of demon possession causes
illness, the casting out of the demon cures the illness. Acts 10:38.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;And this woman, a daughter of Abraham as she is, whom
Satan has bound for eighteen long years, should she not have been released from
this bond on the Sabbath day?&quot;” (Luke 13:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You know of Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed Him with
the Holy Spirit and with power, and how He went about doing good and healing
all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him.” (Acts 10:38, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan is used as a disciplinary agent by God. 1 Cor. 5:5;
1 Tim. 1:19-20; 1 Tim. 3:6-7; 2 Cor. 2:10-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I have decided to deliver such a one to Satan for the
destruction of his flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the
Lord Jesus.” (1 Corinthians 5:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“keeping faith and a good conscience, which some have rejected
and suffered shipwreck in regard to their faith. Among these are Hymenaeus and
Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan, so that they will be taught not to
blaspheme.” (1 Timothy 1:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and not a new convert, so that he will not become conceited
and fall into the condemnation incurred by the devil. And he must have a good
reputation with those outside the church, so that he will not fall into
reproach and the snare of the devil.” (1 Timothy 3:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But one whom you forgive anything, I forgive also; for indeed
what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, I did it for your sakes in
the presence of Christ, so that no advantage would be taken of us by Satan, for
we are not ignorant of his schemes.” (2 Corinthians 2:10-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan was permitted, from the outside, to buffet Paul
with a “thorn in the flesh” type of disease or pain. 2 Cor. 12:7. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, for
this reason, to keep me from exalting myself, there was given me a thorn in the
flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me—to keep me from exalting myself!” (2
Corinthians 12:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are two ways of getting well – prayer and seeking
medical help. Prayer is mentioned in James 5:13-14. The “anointing of oil”
refers to medical help in those days. Oil was used medicinally. Today, the
believer should seek all of the medical capabilities and technology that are
available to them. This too is God's grace provision. The Good Samaritan used
oil and wine on the man found beaten on the side of the road from Jerusalem to
Jericho in Luke 10:33-34. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Is anyone among you suffering? Then he must pray. Is anyone
cheerful? He is to sing praises.” (James 5:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But a Samaritan, who was on a journey, came upon him;
and when he saw him, he felt compassion, and came to him and bandaged up his
wounds, pouring oil and wine on them; and he put him on his own beast, and
brought him to an inn and took care of him.” (Luke 10:33-34, NASB)</p>
