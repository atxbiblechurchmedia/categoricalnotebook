<h2>Israel, Regathering and Restoration</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Regathering </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Fifth Cycle of Discipline will be removed at the Second
Advent when Israel will be regathered in the Land. Matt. 24:29-31; Mark
13:24-27; Isaiah 11:10-16; Ezek. 20:34.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But immediately after the tribulation of those days THE
SUN WILL BE DARKENED, AND THE MOON WILL NOT GIVE ITS LIGHT, AND THE STARS WILL
FALL from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. &quot;And then
the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and then all the tribes of
the earth will mourn, and they will see the SON OF MAN COMING ON THE CLOUDS OF
THE SKY with power and great glory. &quot;And He will send forth His angels
with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four
winds, from one end of the sky to the other.” (Matthew 24:29-31, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But in those days, after that tribulation, THE SUN WILL
BE DARKENED AND THE MOON WILL NOT GIVE ITS LIGHT, AND THE STARS WILL BE FALLING
from heaven, and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken. &quot;Then
they will see THE SON OF MAN COMING IN CLOUDS with great power and glory.
&quot;And then He will send forth the angels, and will gather together His
elect from the four winds, from the farthest end of the earth to the farthest
end of heaven.” (Mark 13:24-27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I will bring you out from the peoples and gather you
from the lands where you are scattered, with a mighty hand and with an
outstretched arm and with wrath poured out;” (Ezekiel 20:34, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Isaiah 11:10-16 is the regathering passage. In Isaiah
11:10, “in that day” refers to the Millennium, “root of Jesse” refers to Jesus
Christ as the root or foundation, and “His resting place” refers to salvation. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then in that day The nations will resort to the root of Jesse,
Who will stand as a signal for the peoples; And His resting place will be
glorious.” (Isaiah 11:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Isaiah 11:11, “remnant” is the regenerate of Israel, “Cush”
is Ethiopia, “Elam” is Syria, “Shinar” is Babylon, “Hamath” is Syria, and “islands
of the sea” refers to the entire world.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then it will happen on that day that the Lord Will again
recover the second time with His hand The remnant of His people, who will
remain, From Assyria, Egypt, Pathros, Cush, Elam, Shinar, Hamath, And from the
islands of the sea.” (Isaiah 11:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Isaiah 11:12, “He” is Jesus Christ, “standard” is a
regimental flag, and “banished ones” are Jews under the fifth cycle of
discipline.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He will lift up a standard for the nations And assemble
the banished ones of Israel, And will gather the dispersed of Judah From the
four corners of the earth.” (Isaiah 11:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Isaiah 11:14 is the fulfillment of the Palestinian
Covenant.</p>

<p class=Verses>“They will swoop down on the slopes of the Philistines on the
west; Together they will plunder the sons of the east; They will possess Edom
and Moab, And the sons of Ammon will be subject to them.” (Isaiah 11:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Isaiah 11:15-16, “tongue of the Sea of Egypt” is the
Red Sea, “the River” is the Euphrates, and “remnant of His people” refers to
the 10 tribes.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the LORD will utterly destroy The tongue of the Sea of
Egypt; And He will wave His hand over the River With His scorching wind; And He
will strike it into seven streams And make men walk over dry-shod. And there
will be a highway from Assyria For the remnant of His people who will be left,
Just as there was for Israel In the day that they came up out of the land of
Egypt.” (Isaiah 11:15-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Feast of the Trumpets is a picture of the regathering
of Israel in the future. Joel 2:1; Joel 2:15-21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Blow a trumpet in Zion, And sound an alarm on My holy
mountain! Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble, For the day of the LORD
is coming; Surely it is near,” (Joel 2:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD will be zealous for His land And will have pity
on His people. The LORD will answer and say to His people, &quot;Behold, I am
going to send you grain, new wine and oil, And you will be satisfied in full
with them; And I will never again make you a reproach among the nations.” (Joel
2:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fact that there are Jews in the Land today only shows
that Satan is active today. The Jews today are still under the fifth cycle of
discipline, which means they are going to be scattered until Jesus Christ
returns. Then and only then will Jesus Christ regather them. He will whistle
for them and the Jews will come back into the Land of Promise. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the meantime, you are going to find Jews scattered in
many lands speaking many Gentile languages. Because of these languages, they
will be able to evangelize during the Tribulation - the 144,000. There will be
some Jews in the Land during the Tribulation, under a dictator.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When David’s greater son, Jesus Christ, comes back as
King, only then can Jews can come back. No Jew is in the Land, legitimately,
without the King. The King is in heaven in session at the right hand of God the
Father. When He returns, He will be in the Land and then the Jews can go back.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jews are under a double curse today of spiritual death as
unbelievers and the fifth cycle of discipline as a race. The only way a Jew can
get out from under the fifth cycle of discipline today is by way of
regeneration, which results in the spiritual life via regeneration whereby they
are no longer a Jew, but part of the Church and a member of the Body of Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Restoration</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jews will be restored as a Nation - Israel under God at
the Second Advent of Jesus Christ. At that time, four unconditional covenants
will be fulfilled. See category on the <a href="#_D-Covenants_to_Israel">Covenants
to Israel</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Isaiah 35:1-2, “wilderness” is the desert and “glory
of Lebanon” are the trees in the desert.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The wilderness and the desert will be glad, And the Arabah
will rejoice and blossom; Like the crocus It will blossom profusely And rejoice
with rejoicing and shout of joy. The glory of Lebanon will be given to it, The
majesty of Carmel and Sharon. They will see the glory of the LORD, The majesty
of our God.” (Isaiah 35:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Isaiah 35:3-4, “Encourage” means to make strong, “come
with vengeance” refers to the Second Advent and to the Baptism of Fire when
unbelievers are judged.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Encourage the exhausted, and strengthen the feeble. Say to
those with anxious heart, &quot;Take courage, fear not. Behold, your God will
come with vengeance; The recompense of God will come, But He will save
you.&quot;” (Isaiah 35:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Isaiah 35:5-6, believers alive at the Second Advent
are not give resurrection bodies. Health is restored. They populate the earth.
Capital punishment is the only source of death. “Streams in the Arabah”
indicates that Jesus Christ will cause nature to be substantially improved.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the eyes of the blind will be opened And the ears of the
deaf will be unstopped. Then the lame will leap like a deer, And the tongue of
the mute will shout for joy. For waters will break forth in the wilderness And
streams in the Arabah.” (Isaiah 35:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Isaiah 35:7-8, the “Highway of Holiness” will be so
wide you can’t wander off of it. “Unclean” is the unbeliever.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The scorched land will become a pool And the thirsty ground
springs of water; In the haunt of jackals, its resting place, Grass becomes
reeds and rushes. A highway will be there, a roadway, And it will be called the
Highway of Holiness. The unclean will not travel on it, But it will be for him
who walks that way, And fools will not wander on it.” (Isaiah 35:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Isaiah 65:20-22 “the one who does not reach the age of
one hundred” refers to capital punishment for capital crimes. “They will not
build and another inhabit, They will not plant and another eat” refers to
private ownership of property and the Jews living in complete freedom.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;No longer will there be in it an infant who lives but a
few days, Or an old man who does not live out his days; For the youth will die
at the age of one hundred And the one who does not reach the age of one hundred
Will be thought accursed. &quot;They will build houses and inhabit them; They
will also plant vineyards and eat their fruit. &quot;They will not build and
another inhabit, They will not plant and another eat; For as the lifetime of a
tree, so will be the days of My people, And My chosen ones will wear out the
work of their hands.” (Isaiah 65:20-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Isaiah 65:23-25, war will not come along and destroy
what is accumulated. “While they are still speaking, I will hear” refers to the
prayer system of the Millennium. Carnivorous animals will become herbivorous. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;They will not labor in vain, Or bear children for
calamity; For they are the offspring of those blessed by the LORD, And their
descendants with them. &quot;It will also come to pass that before they call, I
will answer; and while they are still speaking, I will hear. &quot;The wolf and
the lamb will graze together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox; and dust
will be the serpent's food. They will do no evil or harm in all My holy
mountain,&quot; says the LORD.” (Isaiah 65:23-25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Israel’s Future</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The nation of Israel was founded on regeneration.
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Then on down through history, the leadership of
Israel had some outstanding believers - Moses, Joshua, David and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Born-again Jews have a future in the Tribulation through
witnessing and custodianship of the Word. At the Second Advent, the
unconditional covenants will be fulfilled. They will thus enjoy the Kingdom on
earth.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The purpose of the Jewish nation was custodianship of the
Word, responsibility for its dissemination, and providing the genealogy for the
line of Jesus Christ. Rom. 3:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Great in every respect. First of all, that they were entrusted
with the oracles of God.” (Romans 3:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fifth cycle of discipline during the Church Age is
the result of their failure in fulfilling this purpose. The racial Jew is under
a curse today and is scattered (fifth cycle of discipline) all over the world,
yet they will not lose their identity. The only way cursing can be turned into
blessing for the racial Jew today is for that Jew to personally accept Jesus
Christ as Savior.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Church Age, the Jew is under a double curse of
spiritual death and the fifth Cycle of discipline. Cursing can be turned into
blessing. In the Church Age, regeneration makes them members of the Church and
no longer Jews. Salvation removes the Jew from the double curse. Gal. 3:28.</p>

<p class=Verses>“There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor
free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ
Jesus.” (Galatians 3:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Those Jews who were alive on the day of Pentecost and
were believers were entered into the Church Age by being made a member of the
Body of Christ. They were no longer regenerate Jews, but Church Age believers
and members of the Body of Christ. The Jew in the Church Age will never be a
part of Israel, but the moment they accept Christ, they are entered into union
with Christ and become members of the Church, part of the Body of Christ. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The regenerate Jews of the Age of Israel are a part of
that kingdom which will exist in the future at the Second Advent and have
promises under the four unconditional covenants to Israel. The way to
evangelize Israel today is to give them the Gospel, not to try to make the Old
Testament clear. Paul was a Jew and became a member of the Church. Rom. 1:16;
Rom. 1:11; 1 Cor. 12:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God
for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the
Greek.” (Romans 1:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For I long to see you so that I may impart some spiritual gift
to you, that you may be established;” (Romans 1:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether
Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one
Spirit.” (1 Corinthians 12:13, NASB)</p>
