<h2>Inheritance (Heirship)</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><a name="_D-Inner_Beauty_of"></a>Heirship denotes sharing
the destiny of Jesus Christ as joint heirs. Inheritance is a link to eternity. Heirship
is the plan of God. Every Church Age believer in Jesus Christ is in union with
Christ. The Lord Jesus Christ is the heir of God. His heirship becomes our
heirship because we are in Him. Eph. 1:11. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;also we have obtained an inheritance, having been
predestined according to His purpose who works all things after the counsel of
His will,&quot;  (Ephesians 1:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 8:16-17, “children” refers to the doctrine of
sonship, “heirs” refers to the doctrine of heirship, and “fellow heirs” means
sharing all that Christ has by virtue of being in union with Him. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are
children of God, and if children, heirs also, heirs of God and fellow heirs
with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him so that we may also be glorified with
Him. &quot;  (Romans 8:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If you are not in the family of God, how can you be an
heir of God? To enter the family of God, you must have faith in Jesus Christ as
your Savior. The Lord is the heir of all things and we share in all He has. Heb.
1:2; Gal. 3:26.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;in these last days has spoken to us in His Son, whom He
appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the world.&quot; 
(Hebrews 1:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ
Jesus.&quot;  (Galatians 3:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 Peter 1:4 lists the four characteristics of our
inheritance in Jesus Christ. “Imperishable” means our inheritance cannot be
destroyed by death. “Undefiled” means our inheritance cannot be defiled by our
old sin nature. “Will not fade away” means our inheritance cannot be destroyed
by catastrophe, either natural or human. “Reserved” means our inheritance
cannot be destroyed. Our inheritance is secure forever.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;to obtain an inheritance which is imperishable and
undefiled and will not fade away, reserved in heaven for you,&quot;  (1 Peter
1:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our inheritance from God means that we must have been
justified by grace. God the Father’s satisfaction with the perfect work of
Jesus Christ on the Cross was followed by the imputation of His very own perfect
righteousness to the believer. Titus 3:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;so that being justified by His grace we would be made
heirs according to the hope of eternal life.&quot;  (Titus 3:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To inherit from God, one must possess God’s eternal life.
So, to be an heir of God, you must have His perfect righteousness and eternal
life. 1 John 5:11‑12; 1 Cor. 15:50. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And the testimony is this, that God has given us eternal
life, and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has the life; he who does
not have the Son of God does not have the life.&quot;  (1 John 5:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now I say this, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot
inherit the kingdom of God; nor does the perishable inherit the
imperishable.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 15:50, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Heirship is based on election. Heirship is based on the
death of another. Therefore, heirship of Church Age believers is based on the
New Covenant. Rom. 5:8; Heb. 9:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that
while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.&quot;  (Romans 5:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For this reason He is the mediator of a new covenant, so
that, since a death has taken place for the redemption of the transgressions
that were committed under the first covenant, those who have been called may
receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.&quot;  (Hebrews 9:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Heirship is provided for us as part of God’s divine
promise on the basis of grace. It is provided above our imagination and it will
last forever and ever. Gal. 3:28-29.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave
nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ
Jesus. And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's descendants, heirs
according to promise.&quot;  (Galatians 3:28-29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Salvation is the qualification for heirship with an even
greater inheritance for eternity. Col. 1:12; 1 Peter 1:3‑5; Heb. 2:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified us to
share in the inheritance of the saints in Light.&quot;  (Colossians 1:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope
through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to obtain an
inheritance which is imperishable and undefiled and will not fade away,
reserved in heaven for you, who are protected by the power of God through faith
for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.” (1 Peter 1:3-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;God also testifying with them, both by signs and wonders
and by various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit according to His own
will.&quot;  (Hebrews 2:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The indwelling Holy Spirit is the down payment on our eternal
inheritance of perfect eternal prosperity. Eph. 1:14; Gal. 4:6; Eph. 1:13‑14.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;who is given as a pledge of our inheritance, with a view
to the redemption of God's own possession, to the praise of His glory.&quot; 
(Ephesians 1:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of
His Son into our hearts, crying, &quot;Abba! Father!&quot;&quot;  (Galatians
4:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;In Him, you also, after listening to the message of
truth, the gospel of your salvation—having also believed, you were sealed in
Him with the Holy Spirit of promise, who is given as a pledge of our
inheritance, with a view to the redemption of God's own possession, to the
praise of His glory.&quot;  (Ephesians 1:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We can know the glory of our inheritance. Eph. 1:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened,
so that you will know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of
the glory of His inheritance in the saints,&quot;  (Ephesians 1:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Unbelievers will not have an inheritance. 1 Cor. 6:9-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit
the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor
adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor
drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, will inherit the kingdom of God.&quot; 
(1 Corinthians 6:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our inheritance cannot be squandered. God can only treat
heirs in love and mercy. Imagine being heirs in the plan of God. This is a
tremendous doctrine.</p>
