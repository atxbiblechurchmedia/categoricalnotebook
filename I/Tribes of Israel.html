<h2>Tribes of Israel</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Chronological Sequence</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ruben, the son of Leah as first born, should have had rulership
of the tribe, but he lost it to Judah. He should have been the priesthood of
the tribe, but he lost it to Levi. He should have had the Double Portion, but he
lost it to Joseph (Ephraim and Manasseh). Gen. 29:32.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“Leah conceived and bore a son and named him Reuben, for she
said, &quot;Because the LORD has seen my affliction; surely now my husband will
love me.&quot;” (Genesis 29:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Simeon, son of Leah. Gen. 29:33.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then she conceived again and bore a son and said,
&quot;Because the LORD has heard that I am unloved, He has therefore given me
this son also.&quot; So she named him Simeon.” (Genesis 29:33, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Levi, son of Leah, the priestly tribe. Gen. 29:34.</p>

<p class=Verses>“She conceived again and bore a son and said, &quot;Now this
time my husband will become attached to me, because I have borne him three
sons.&quot; Therefore he was named Levi.” (Genesis 29:34, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Judah, son of Leah. Gen. 29:35.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And she conceived again and bore a son and said, &quot;This
time I will praise the LORD.&quot; Therefore she named him Judah. Then she
stopped bearing.” (Genesis 29:35, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Dan, son of Bilhah (Rachel’s handmaid). Gen. 30:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Rachel said, &quot;God has vindicated me, and has indeed
heard my voice and has given me a son.&quot; Therefore she named him Dan.”
(Genesis 30:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Naphtali, son of Bilhah. Gen. 30:8.</p>

with my sister, and I have indeed prevailed.&quot; And she named him Naphtali.”
(Genesis 30:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Gad, son of Zilpah (Leah’s handmaid). Gen. 30:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Leah said, &quot;How fortunate!&quot; So she named him
Gad.” (Genesis 30:11, NASB)</p>

NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Issachar, son of Leah: Gen. 30:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Leah said, &quot;God has given me my wages because I gave
my maid to my husband.&quot; So she named him Issachar.” (Genesis 30:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Zebulun, son of Leah. Gen. 30:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Leah said, &quot;God has endowed me with a good gift; now
my husband will dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons.&quot; So she
named him Zebulun.” (Genesis 30:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Joseph, son of Rachel. This tribe received the double
portion instead of Reuben. It went to two sons of Joseph - Ephraim and
Manasseh. Gen. 30:24.</p>

<p class=Verses>“She named him Joseph, saying, &quot;May the LORD give me
another son.&quot;” (Genesis 30:24, NASB)</p>

she named him Ben-oni; but his father called him Benjamin.” (Genesis 35:18,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Historical Sequence</b></p>

of Israel from the time of Malachi up to the time of Christ. Gen. 49:3; Gen.
49:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Reuben, you are my firstborn; My might and the beginning
of my strength, Preeminent in dignity and preeminent in power.” (Genesis 49:3,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Simeon and Levi are brothers; Their swords are
implements of violence.” (Genesis 49:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Judah, son of Leah, is a picture of Israel at the time of
the Second Advent. Gen. 49:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Judah, your brothers shall praise you; Your hand shall
be on the neck of your enemies; Your father's sons shall bow down to you.”
(Genesis 49:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Zebulun and Issachar, sons of Leah, depict Israel
scattered among the nations during the Church Age. Gen. 49:13-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Zebulun will dwell at the seashore; And he shall be a
haven for ships, And his flank shall be toward Sidon. &quot;Issachar is a
strong donkey, Lying down between the sheepfolds.” (Genesis 49:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Dan, son of Bilhah, depicts the apostate Jews in the
Tribulation. The Dictator of Palestine, the False Prophet, will come from this
tribe. Gen. 49:16-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Dan shall judge his people, As one of the tribes of
Israel. &quot;Dan shall be a serpent in the way, A horned snake in the path,
That bites the horse's heels, So that his rider falls backward.” (Genesis
49:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Gad and Asher, sons of Zilpah, will be a picture of the
believing Jews during the Tribulation. Gen. 49:19-20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;As for Gad, raiders shall raid him, But he will raid at
their heels. &quot;As for Asher, his food shall be rich, And he will yield
royal dainties.” (Genesis 49:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Naphtali, son of Bilhah will be a picture of the
believing Jews during the Tribulation. Gen. 49:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Naphtali is a doe let loose, He gives beautiful words.”

Advent of Jesus Christ, especially to Israel. Gen. 49:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Joseph is a fruitful bough, A fruitful bough by a
spring; Its branches run over a wall.” (Genesis 49:22, NASB)</p>

the rule of Christ during the Millennium. Gen. 49:27.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Benjamin is a ravenous wolf; In the morning he devours
the prey, And in the evening he divides the spoil.&quot;” (Genesis 49:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The three great prophecies of Genesis are Salvation, the
origin and trend of the races through Genesis 10, and one national entity. Gen.
3:15; Gen. 9:25; Gen. 49. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And I will put enmity Between you and the woman, And between
your seed and her seed; He shall bruise you on the head, And you shall bruise
him on the heel.&quot;” (Genesis 3:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So he said, &quot;Cursed be Canaan; A servant of servants He
shall be to his brothers.&quot;” (Genesis 9:25, NASB)</p>
