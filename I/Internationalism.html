<h2><a name="_Internationalism"></a>Internationalism</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Internationalism is the governing of more than one nation
under one head. A major passage on internationalism is Genesis 11, the Tower of
Babel episode. This demonstrated God’s divine attitude toward internationalism.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers are told to be faithful to their national
entities. No form of internationalism is acceptable to God. This includes
political internationalism such as Communism, Socialism and the United Nations.
Religious internationalism includes some eastern religions, the Roman Catholic
Church, and the World Council of Churches. Rom. 13:1-7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Every person is to be in subjection to the governing
authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist
are established by God.” (Romans 13:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Render to all what is due them: tax to whom tax is due; custom
to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor.” (Romans 13:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Christianity is opposed to any form of internationalism. Internationalism
is a vicious attack on Divine Institution #4 - Nationalism and also destroys
Divine Institution #1 - Volition. The Tower of Babel was a combination of
political and religious internationalism.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Internationalism is a Satanic device to try to frustrate
the plan of God by breaking down, infiltrating, and opposing the plan of God. To
understand the philosophy of Satan’s Internationalism, study the following
passages (besides Genesis 11). Rom. 12:9-10; Isaiah 14:14-19; Rev. 20:8; Rev.
12:9-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil; cling to
what is good. Be devoted to one another in brotherly love; give preference to
one another in honor;” (Romans 12:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“'I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will make
myself like the Most High.' &quot;Nevertheless you will be thrust down to
Sheol, To the recesses of the pit. &quot;Those who see you will gaze at you,
They will ponder over you, saying, 'Is this the man who made the earth tremble,
Who shook kingdoms, Who made the world like a wilderness And overthrew its
cities, Who did not allow his prisoners to go home?' &quot;All the kings of the
nations lie in glory, Each in his own tomb. &quot;But you have been cast out of
your tomb Like a rejected branch, Clothed with the slain who are pierced with a
sword, Who go down to the stones of the pit Like a trampled corpse.” (Isaiah
14:14-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four
corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for the war; the
number of them is like the sand of the seashore.” (Revelation 20:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the great dragon was thrown down, the serpent of old who
is called the devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was thrown down
to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him. Then I heard a loud
voice in heaven, saying, &quot;Now the salvation, and the power, and the
kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ have come, for the accuser
of our brethren has been thrown down, he who accuses them before our God day
and night.” (Revelation 12:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan is said to be the “god of this world” and is the father
of religion. Satan is also said to be the “ruler of this world.” 2 Cor. 4:3-4; John
12:31; John 14:30. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who
are perishing, in whose case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the
unbelieving so that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory of
Christ, who is the image of God.” (2 Corinthians 4:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Now judgment is upon this world; now the ruler of this
world will be cast out.” (John 12:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I will not speak much more with you, for the ruler of
the world is coming, and he has nothing in Me;” (John 14:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan is also called the “prince of the power of the air.”
Satan is the ruler of this present world system. Eph. 2:2. In Job 1:7 and Job
2:2, “roaming about on the earth and walking around on it” is an idiom for
rulership in the Hebrew.</p>

<p class=Verses>“in which you formerly walked according to the course of this
world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is
now working in the sons of disobedience.” (Ephesians 2:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD said to Satan, &quot;From where do you come?&quot;
Then Satan answered the LORD and said, &quot;From roaming about on the earth
and walking around on it.&quot;” (Job 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD said to Satan, &quot;Where have you come from?&quot;
Then Satan answered the LORD and said, &quot;From roaming about on the earth
and walking around on it.&quot;” (Job 2:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Whenever Satan starts a religious organization to
counteract the Word of God, a demonic organization is always involved. When
Satan finds the need to establish a new religion somewhere, that new religion
is compatible with the culture of that area (e.g., Mormonism, etc.).</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some of Satan’s religions are internationalist in
character and some are local. Mormonism began as a localized religion and since
has become international as has the Jehovah’s Witnesses. During the Church Age,
religious internationalism is active, but it will never be as strong as in the
Tribulation, when it will reach its maximum.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Internationalism results in maximum destruction of governing
bodies on this earth, minimum use of free will resulting in minimum freedom,
maximum heathenism or negative volition at the paint of God-consciousness, and
minimum amount of evangelism. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Philosophy of Internationalism</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Internationalism results from seven aspects of man’s
revolt against God’s plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Idealistic Rebellion Against God.</i> God had told
them to spread abroad after the flood, but instead of spreading abroad, they
built up. God promised in the Noahic Covenant that He would never again destroy
the world by water. They did not believe God’s Word. They rejected the Noahic
Covenant and they hoped that the next time God did something like that they
would be above the water line. This tells us that they were familiar with the
Word of God, but they defied the Word and they set up an antithetical idealism
- a flood-proof structure. Gen. 9:1; Gen. 9:7; Gen. 11:1-4. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, &quot;Be
fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth.” (Genesis 9:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;As for you, be fruitful and multiply; Populate the earth
abundantly and multiply in it.&quot;” (Genesis 9:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now the whole earth used the same language and the same
words.” (Genesis 11:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“They said, &quot;Come, let us build for ourselves a city, and
a tower whose top will reach into heaven, and let us make for ourselves a name,
otherwise we will be scattered abroad over the face of the whole earth.&quot;”
(Genesis 11:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Volitional Rebellion Against God.</i> Man was to
spread out. In Genesis 11:4, “let us” means that man in mass had rejected
Divine Institution #4, Nationalism. They rationalized that by holding together
they could solve the problems of the human race. However, the panacea is not
the masses in internationalism, but individual, personal. So there has been
from the first the conflict between individuals and collectivism, which is
anti-Divine Institution #1, Volition. A decadent nation tends to mass in cities
resulting in one of the characteristics of the fourth cycle of discipline. Lev.
26:25.</p>

<p class=Verses>“'I will also bring upon you a sword which will execute
vengeance for the covenant; and when you gather together into your cities, I
will send pestilence among you, so that you shall be delivered into enemy
hands.” (Leviticus 26:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Governmental Rebellion Against God.</i> They wanted to
build a city. This was to be an international city. They should have continued
with an agriculture economy, which afforded the privacy needed to raise
families.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Physical Rebellion Against God.</i> Man’s reaction to
the flood of past history was to build a tower above the high-water mark of the
flood. Man also thought that the arm of the flesh was strong enough to save.
The result was a gigantic brick tower, a ziggurat, an Assyrian-Babylon tower.  Man’s
collective thinking was, “We’ll show you, God. We’ll build a physical structure
that will leave us high and dry if you try that flood thing again.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Spiritual Rebellion Against God.</i> The tower was to
reach heaven. They felt that an international brotherhood was the answer and
that man’s work would get them to heaven without God’s help. The fact that it
was obviously impossible to build a structure up to heaven was beside the
point. They were intent on showing that by man’s ability and labor alone, they
would succeed. This was a classic grace versus legalism operation. God had said
that He would provide by His grace alone the way to heaven. These men said, “we
will do it, we don’t need God.” Any system of internationalism applies the same
concept. We will provide heaven on earth, the absolute and the perfect.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Personal Rebellion Against God.</i> In Genesis 11:4, “let
us make for ourselves a name” means to let us make a reputation and is pure egoism.
We are going to make a reputation for ourselves. This is self-exaltation. Man
receives the glory in the cult of egoism. Man by man’s abilities can solve
man’s problems. Not so.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Structural Rebellion Against God.</i> In Genesis 11:4,
“otherwise we will be scattered abroad”  means they refused the divine edict. God
said to be scattered. They said we’ll stick together. This is also the
philosophy that materialism is the god of man and can solve the problems of
man.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Internationalism actually abolishes national government,
private property, marriage and family life. It makes the state responsible for
education and people’s needs. Inheritance is also abolished, as is biblical
Christianity and patriotism.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Origin of Internationalism</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There was quite a population gain four generations after
the great flood. God had given the command for mankind to scatter throughout
the earth and form many nations. They disobeyed this command and we see Satan,
who was the ruler of the world, attempting to destroy the whole earth. Gen.
11:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the LORD
confused the language of the whole earth; and from there the LORD scattered
them abroad over the face of the whole earth.” (Genesis 11:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Genesis 11:1 says that the whole earth was of one
language. At first glance, this may seem like a pretty good idea. Today, there
is a great deal of emphasis on modern high-speed communication. It might seem
wonderful if we all spoke the same language. However, several times in human history
people have attempted to formulate one international language.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now the whole earth used the same language and the same
words.” (Genesis 11:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Greece tried it with some measure of success. It was
attempted with Latin several different times in Western Europe. And, of course,
we have several modern attempts that are almost ridiculous like Esperanto and
so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>From the divine viewpoint this is not desirable at all.
God has divided the human race for the purpose of giving everyone in the human
race maximum freedom. But you cannot have maximum freedom if you have one world
government of any type. The old sin nature cannot stand world rulership. The
human ego is always too great. The sin nature’s power lust plus ego lust plus
Satan being the ruler of the world means that Satan controls and these are the
objectives of Satan.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The rise of internationalism came from this one language
and one speech rebellion against God. So it became a curse. If everyone spoke
the same language today, there would still not be world peace and mutual
understanding. Man still possesses an old sin nature and cultural exchange is
never the answer.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The answer is personal and individual. At the start, Socialism
champions the rights of the individual, but its deeper doctrine merges the
individual into the mass and thus they lose their identify and freedom. But the
Gospel of Jesus Christ is the only good news that takes the individual out of
the mass and makes them an individual through regeneration.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Divine Attitude Toward Internationalism </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 11:5, God “came down to see” what man was up
to. This is an anthropopathism as God is omniscient and omnipresent and does
not need to go anywhere to see all that can be seen. </p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD came down to see the city and the tower which the
sons of men had built.” (Genesis 11:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 11:6, God labeled it as internationalism. God
knew that man doing anything “which they purpose to do” would lead to their own
destruction. </p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD said, &quot;Behold, they are one people, and they all
have the same language. And this is what they began to do, and now nothing
which they purpose to do will be impossible for them.” (Genesis 11:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 11:7, “let Us” refers to the Trinity. God
broke up the first try at internationalism.  God’s attitude toward
internationalism is always negative because He desires to allow mankind to live
in freedom where volition toward God-consciousness and volition toward
salvation through the work of Jesus Christ on the Cross can always be exercised.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Come, let Us go down and there confuse their language,
so that they will not understand one another's speech.&quot;” (Genesis 11:7,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Start of Nationalism </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Those of the same language banded together in nations.
Thus, Genesis 10 performs a two-fold purpose. It explains the prophecy at the
end of Genesis 9. It also explains how God stopped the first great system of
Internationalism.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He stopped it by spreading them geographically. He
stopped it by spreading them linguistically. God makes different races. These
are all precepts of Nationalism. There is no super race. When a nation gets
powerful and breaks down national barriers, then that nation destroys itself
and goes downhill.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Illustrations of Internationalism </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There have been many forms of Internationalism in human
history. None of them have ever succeeded. Socialism and Marxism use the United
Nations and the World Council of Churches to try to achieve their goals. They
are all trying to achieve the same goal - rule the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Gnosticism is a system of religious Internationalism that
lasted nearly 600 years before it bit the dust. Some saw that heathenism and
the religions of the world were going down, so they combined the best points of
heathenism with Judaism and took some of the vocabulary and teachings of
Christianity and this was fused into one system of Internationalism. It almost
conquered the world. There are portions of seven New Testament epistles that warn
against Gnosticism as a system of religious Internationalism.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Romanism was the next great system of religious Internationalism.
This started out about 600-700 AD as just another branch of Christianity. Suddenly,
it developed and reached out and took control of everything.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Illuminati was started in 1776 by Adam Weishaupt. This
began its operation in Western Europe and had six points which were taken over
by Stalin on how to conquer the United States by peaceful means. Do you want
this? Abolition of national government so a single world government can take
over! This abolishes private property and destroys human enterprise. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Abolition of inheritance and our federal income tax
system are trying to do the same thing - without legislation. This includes
abolition of marriage and family life where the State owns all babies and takes
responsibility for their education from the cradle to the grave. There is no
regard for parent’s volition. Many would like to abolish biblical Christianity.
To them, the Bible is the great enemy. They would like to abolish patriotism in
any form because they feel it is an enemy of Internationalism.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1932 when Stalin wrote his treatise, he took six
points from Adam Weishaupt’s Illuminati to be applied for the conquest of the
United States. Try to see how many are already being practiced in our country
today. They are:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1. Use
philosophy, mysticism, cults in order to discredit Christian doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>2. The
destruction of marriage and introduction of theoretical interracial practices.
Marriages between black and white.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>3. In the realm
of culture and ascetics, cultivate the ugly, the futuristic, the aberrant in
art, drama and music. The stuff that passes for art is fantastic, the stuff of nightmares.
Look at drama, or the movies today and what they portray. They are sadistic,
melodramatic, immoral, perverted, and psychotic.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>4. Create
unrest, suspicion, revolt among the working classes, promote class warfare. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>5. Standardize
the cheap and the shoddy, advocate state ownership of property and business as
the antidote, exchange all foreign currency at slight discounts for United
States gold and gradually exchange all gold from circulation. This has already been
accomplished.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>6. Set up the
idea of thinking Internationally so as to undermine all national patriotism,
undermine all preparation for defense and ridicule all patriotic efforts.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Rycoff in Pravada stated, “It is our duty to inculcate in
the minds of all nations the theory of international friendship, pacificism and
disarmament and at the same time build up our own military establishment.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Yneen said, “When a country is selected for attack, we
must first set up before the youth of that land a mental barrage which will
forever prohibit the youth to be molded into an armed force to oppose our
invading armies.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Nikolai Bukharin the bloody butcher gives a significant
trend, “Friendship with liberal-minded ministers should be sought.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If you look at the writings of prominent ministers of
today and the last 50 years, you will see many who are tolerant of Socialism and
Marxism ideology. Such ministers who advocate the destruction of our military
weapons of mass destruction and are opposed to any form of military training.
Some of these ministers say there is religious freedom in countries such as
China, Russia, and Cuba and plead for better understanding with such
totalitarian countries. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Word of God makes it very clear that Internationalism
destroys evangelism, is against the Word of God, and ultimately keeps people
from accepting Jesus Christ as their personal Savior.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><a name="_Internationalism_in_the"></a><b>Internationalism
in the Tribulation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Tribulation will be the greatest period of Internationalism
that the world has ever known. The king of the North – northern 
internationalism. The king of the South – southern /African internationalism. The
king of the East – eastern internationalism. King of the West – religious
internationalism. Internationalism will be a trend right down to the Second
Advent of Jesus Christ and only Jesus Christ will destroy it.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Internationalism is the governing of more than one nation
under one head. When a dictator finds they need a new religion somewhere to
counter the truth, they start one compatible with the culture of that area.
Some of their religions are international in nature and some are local. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There will be two types of internationalism in the
Tribulation – Religious and Political. Babylon will represent religious
internationalism as the Revived Roman Empire and its religious system in the
Tribulation. All international religious organizations will be under demon
influence. The only bona fide Internationalism will be a theocracy and will
come into existence at the Second Advent of Christ to the earth. Our Lord will
rule personally, but there will still be nations in operation. Rev. 20:4
through Rev. 22:2.</p>
