<h2><a name="_Indwelling_1"></a><a name="_D-Indwelling_of_the"></a>Indwelling
of the Trinity</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The body of every Church Age believer is indwelt by each
member of the Trinity. This is the only dispensation in human history where the
believer’s body is indwelt by God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy
Spirit. This indwelling is permanent and cannot be changed. It is also
independent of whether the believer is spiritual or carnal.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All Church Age believers are indwelled by God the Father.
John 14:23; Eph. 4:6; 2 John 1:9; Phil. 2:13. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Jesus answered and said to him, &quot;If anyone loves Me, he
will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and
make Our abode with him.” (John 14:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and
in all.” (Ephesians 4:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Anyone who goes too far and does not abide in the teaching of
Christ, does not have God; the one who abides in the teaching, he has both the
Father and the Son.” (2 John 1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“for it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work
for His good pleasure.” (Philippians 2:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All Church Age believers are indwelled by God the Son. John
14:20; John 17:22-23; Rom. 8:10; 2 Cor. 13:5; Gal. 2:20; Col. 1:27; 1 John
3:24.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and
you in Me, and I in you.” (John 14:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;The glory which You have given Me I have given to them,
that they may be one, just as We are one; I in them and You in Me, that they
may be perfected in unity, so that the world may know that You sent Me, and
loved them, even as You have loved Me.” (John 17:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“If Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin,
yet the spirit is alive because of righteousness.” (Romans 8:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Test yourselves to see if you are in the faith; examine
yourselves! Or do you not recognize this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is
in you—unless indeed you fail the test?” (2 Corinthians 13:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“to whom God willed to make known what is the riches of the
glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of
glory.” (Colossians 1:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All Church Age believers are indwelled by God the Holy
Spirit. Rom. 8:11; 1 Cor. 3:16; 1 Cor. 6:19-20; 2 Cor. 6:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells
in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your
mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you.” (Romans 8:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do you not know that you are a temple of God and that the
Spirit of God dwells in you?” (1 Corinthians 3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy
Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and that you are not your own?
For you have been bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body.” (1
Corinthians 6:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Or what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For we are
the temple of the living God; just as God said, &quot;I WILL DWELL IN THEM AND
WALK AMONG THEM; AND I WILL BE THEIR GOD, AND THEY SHALL BE MY PEOPLE.” (2
Corinthians 6:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Father has provided each believer with unique grace
resources. The indwelling of every Church Age believer by each member of the infinite,
eternal, and omnipresent Trinity is the most unusual grace provision in human
history. This has not and will not occur in any other dispensation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><a name="_Indwelling_of_Jesus"></a><b>Indwelling of God
the Father</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Father indwells the body of every Church Age
believer to glorify His plan for the Church Age. His indwelling is assurance of
His work in eternity past on behalf of each Church Age believer. John 14:23;
Eph 4:6; 2 John 1:9</p>

<p class=Verses>“Jesus answered and said to him, &quot;If anyone loves Me, he
will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and
make Our abode with him.” (John 14:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and
in all.” (Ephesians 4:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Anyone who goes too far and does not abide in the teaching of
Christ, does not have God; the one who abides in the teaching, he has both the
Father and the Son.” (2 John 1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The indwelling of God the Father provides blessings to
the believer while on earth and in eternity. God the Father indwells us in
order that these might become a reality. His presence guarantees the
availability of those blessings.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He has designed the spiritual life for every Church Age
believer by which we execute His plan, purpose, and will for our lives. He is
the author of the plan of God. Part of that perfect plan is an individual plan and
ministry for every Church Age believer. The indwelling of God the Father
glorifies His plan for the Church Age. Eph. 1:3; Eph. 1:6; Eph. 1:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ,”
(Ephesians 1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely
bestowed on us in the Beloved.” (Ephesians 1:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“to the end that we who were the first to hope in Christ would
be to the praise of His glory.” (Ephesians 1:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The indwelling of God the Father in every Church Age
believer is unique and without precedent. It is a part of the mystery doctrine
of the Church Age. Never before in history has any believer been indwelt by God
the Father.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><a name="_Indwelling_of_the"></a><b>Indwelling of God the
Son, Jesus Christ </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The deity of Jesus Christ as the Shekinah Glory indwells
the body of every Church Age believer. This is unique in human history. Rom.
8:10; Col. 1:27.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin,
yet the spirit is alive because of righteousness.” (Romans 8:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“to whom God willed to make known what is the riches of the
glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of
glory.” (Colossians 1:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For the Church Age, Jesus Christ is not visible to
mankind on earth and will continue to reside in the third heaven until the
Rapture of the Church. The indwelling of the deity of Jesus Christ as the
Shekinah Glory is our guarantee that God will provide His unlimited grace
resources including the enabling divine power of the Holy Spirit who empowers
the believer to live the spiritual life and to fulfill God's plan for your
life. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The indwelling of the deity of Jesus Christ as the
Shekinah Glory is our guarantee that divine blessings will be given to the
believer who advances in the spiritual life and fulfills the plan of God for
their lives. The indwelling of Jesus Christ guarantees our eternal security,
our eternal life after death and a resurrection body at the Rapture of the
Church and into eternity. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The indwelling of Jesus Christ is a sign that every
Church Age believer is a member of the family of God, a royal priesthood. The
indwelling of Jesus Christ is the basis for the believer assigning top priority
to their relationship with God over relationships with people. This
relationship is tested by your attitude toward Bible doctrine. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Knowing that Jesus Christ indwells your body becomes the
motivation and confidence you need to advance to spiritual maturity. Jesus
Christ now indwells you as a guarantee of your security, riches, and blessings
both in this life and in eternity. Jesus Christ conveys those blessings to His
own righteousness in us.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Christ indwells us to motivate us to keep advancing
spiritually. If you understand the doctrine of the indwelling of Christ, you
will have the capacity to enjoy your grace blessings without being destroyed
from lack of capacity. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/J/Jesus%20Christ%2C%20Indwelling.html">Jesus
Christ, Indwelling</a>. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Indwelling of God the Holy Spirit </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>From the moment of salvation onward, God the Holy Spirit
permanently indwells the body of every Church Age believer. The Holy Spirit
indwells the body of every Church Age believer to make their bodies a suitable
temple for the indwelling of the deity of Jesus Christ as the Shekinah Glory
and for the permanent indwelling of God the Father. The Holy Spirit also
indwells the body of every Church Age believer to provide a base of operation
for the use of His omnipotence to empower the believer’s spiritual life via the
filling of the Holy Spirit. The believer can then grow spiritually and execute
the plan of God in the spiritual life. John 7:39; Rom. 5:5; Rom. 8:9; Rom. 8:11;
John 14:17; 1 Cor. 3:16; 1 Cor. 6:19-20; Gal. 3:2; Gal. 4:6; 1 John 3:24; 1 Cor.
2:12; 2 Cor. 1:21; 2 Cor 6:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But this He spoke of the Spirit, whom those who believed in
Him were to receive; for the Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not
yet glorified.” (John 7:39, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“However, you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed
the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if anyone does not have the Spirit of
Christ, he does not belong to Him.” (Romans 8:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“that is the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive,
because it does not see Him or know Him, but you know Him because He abides
with you and will be in you.” (John 14:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy
Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and that you are not your own?
For you have been bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body.” (1
Corinthians 6:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The one who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in
him. We know by this that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He has given us.”
(1 John 3:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Or what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For we are
the temple of the living God; just as God said, &quot;I WILL DWELL IN THEM AND
WALK AMONG THEM; AND I WILL BE THEIR GOD, AND THEY SHALL BE MY PEOPLE.” (2
Corinthians 6:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The indwelling of the Holy Spirit in every believer was
prophesied prior to the beginning of the Church Age by Jesus Christ. This indwelling
was impossible before Jesus Christ had ascended and was glorified. See category
