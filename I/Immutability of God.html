<h2>Immutability of God</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><a name="_D-Imputation"></a>God is immutable and
therefore never changes. Since He is and always has been perfect and absolute
in all of His attributes, He cannot improve or be less than perfection.
Therefore, if He changed, He would no longer be absolute and perfect. God has
never changed from what He has always been with perfect consistency from
eternity past on through to eternity future. Nothing that has ever happened or
will happen causes any member of the triune God to change in any way. He is
perfect and unchangeable is all of His attributes. God’s plan for humanity has
never changed from eternity past where it always existed with God. Because God
never changes, He is absolute stability. Psalms 102:27; Mal. 3:6; Heb. 13:8; James
1:17; Isaiah 40:28.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;But You are the same, And Your years will not come
to an end.&quot;  (Psalms 102:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;For I, the LORD, do not change; therefore you, O
sons of Jacob, are not consumed.&quot;  (Malachi 3:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and
forever.&quot;  (Hebrews 13:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Every good thing given and every perfect gift is from
above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation
or shifting shadow.&quot;  (James 1:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Do you not know? Have you not heard? The Everlasting God,
the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth Does not become weary or tired.
His understanding is inscrutable.&quot;  (Isaiah 40:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God’s Immutability Results In Faithfulness</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s immutability means that He is perfectly faithful in
all things - no matter what we think, say, or do. He is faithful in His
provision and protection to all members of the human race throughout their
lives. He provides us all with His sustaining grace blessing of the form of
food, clothing, shelter, transportation, and He perpetuates our lives. All of
God’s provision and protection perpetuates our lives so that we have time and
opportunity to achieve, through positive volition, all that God has planned for
our lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For believers, He provides additional blessing because of
our consistent learning of and obedience to Bible doctrine. This learning and
obedience to His Word through the filling of the Holy Spirit results in
spiritual growth, an increased capacity for love, life, liberty, and an
increased capacity to properly handle the blessings that He bestows.    </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The immutability of God's character means that God never
lets others down. He is eternally and perfectly faithful. God’s perfect
faithfulness is a product of His immutability. Psalms 36:5; Psalms 89:33;
Psalms 119:90; Lam. 3:23. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Your lovingkindness, O LORD, extends to the heavens, Your
faithfulness reaches to the skies.&quot;  (Psalms 36:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;But I will not break off My lovingkindness from
him, Nor deal falsely in My faithfulness.&quot;  (Psalms 89:33, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Your faithfulness continues throughout all generations;
You established the earth, and it stands.&quot;  (Psalms 119:90, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; They are new every morning; Great is Your
faithfulness.&quot;  (Lamentations 3:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is faithful to keep each and every one of His
promises. Num. 23:19; 1 Kings 8:56; 2 Cor. 1:20; Titus 1:1-2; Heb. 10:23; Heb.
11:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;God is not a man, that He should lie, Nor a son of
man, that He should repent; Has He said, and will He not do it? Or has He
spoken, and will He not make it good?&quot;  (Numbers 23:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Blessed be the LORD, who has given rest to His
people Israel, according to all that He promised; not one word has failed of
all His good promise, which He promised through Moses His servant.&quot;  (1
Kings 8:56, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For as many as are the promises of God, in Him they are
yes; therefore also through Him is our Amen to the glory of God through
us.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 1:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Paul, a bond-servant of God and an apostle of Jesus
Christ, for the faith of those chosen of God and the knowledge of the truth
which is according to godliness, in the hope of eternal life, which God, who
cannot lie, promised long ages ago,&quot;  (Titus 1:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without
wavering, for He who promised is faithful;&quot;  (Hebrews 10:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;By faith even Sarah herself received ability to conceive,
even beyond the proper time of life, since she considered Him faithful who had
promised.&quot;  (Hebrews 11:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is faithful to forgive our sins that we acknowledge
or name to Him in prayer. God is also faithful to keep us secure in our
salvation. 1 John 1:9; 2 Tim. 2:12-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&quot;  (1 John
1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If we endure, we will also reign with Him; If we deny
Him, He also will deny us; If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He
cannot deny Himself.&quot;  (2 Timothy 2:12-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is faithful in that He delivers us in times of
pressure. He is faithful in our suffering. 1 Cor. 10:13; 1 Peter 4:19.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;No temptation has overtaken you but such as is common to
man; and God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you
are able, but with the temptation will provide the way of escape also, so that
you will be able to endure it.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 10:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore, those also who suffer according to the will of
God shall entrust their souls to a faithful Creator in doing what is
right.&quot;  (1 Peter 4:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He is faithful in that He will provide eternal blessings
to us. God is also faithful in that He always stabilizes us as believers
through His Word. 1 Thess. 5:24; 2 Thess. 3:3. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Faithful is He who calls you, and He also will bring it
to pass.&quot;  (1 Thessalonians 5:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But the Lord is faithful, and He will strengthen and
protect you from the evil one. &quot;  (2 Thessalonians 3:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is also faithful. Heb. 3:1-2; Heb. 13:8;
Rev. 1:5; Rev. 19:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly
calling, consider Jesus, the Apostle and High Priest of our confession; He was
faithful to Him who appointed Him, as Moses also was in all His house.&quot; 
(Hebrews 3:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and
forever.&quot;  (Hebrews 13:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the
firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To Him who
loves us and released us from our sins by His blood—&quot;  (Revelation 1:5,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and
He who sat on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges
and wages war.&quot;  (Revelation 19:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God’s Perfection Is Unchanging</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is perfect in every way. In order to stay that way,
He cannot change from that pinnacle of absolute and undiluted perfection. This
is immutability. Therefore, our perfect God cannot change. Psalms 102:26-27;
Mal. 3:6; Heb. 1:12. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Even they will perish, but You endure; And all of
them will wear out like a garment; Like clothing You will change them and they
will be changed. &quot;But You are the same, And Your years will not come to an
end.&quot;  (Psalms 102:26-27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;For I, the LORD, do not change; therefore you, O
sons of Jacob, are not consumed.&quot;  (Malachi 3:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;AND LIKE A MANTLE YOU WILL ROLL THEM UP; LIKE A GARMENT
THEY WILL ALSO BE CHANGED. BUT YOU ARE THE SAME, AND YOUR YEARS WILL NOT COME
TO AN END.&quot;&quot;  (Hebrews 1:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He cannot ever become better that He is or less perfect
than He is. He has always been perfect since before time began and will remain
so for the eternal future. God is not capable of changing nor is He susceptible
to change.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The immutability of God is consistent with His freedom
and ceaseless activity. God is free to do anything He wills consistent with His
perfect attributes and character. He is also able to do anything He wills, but
it must always be consistent with His perfect attributes and character. This
means that God’s provision of our eternal salvation based on our
non-meritorious faith belief in the substitutionary spiritual death of Jesus
Christ on the Cross is the centerpiece of His eternal purpose. God the Father planned
it, Jesus Christ executed it, and the Holy Spirit reveals it.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God’s Word and Works Never Change</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s Word and works never change because they were
perfect in eternity past and will remain perfect for the eternal future. Matt.
24:35; Psalms 119:89; Isaiah 40:8; Eccl. 3:14. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will
not pass away. &quot;  (Matthew 24:35, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; Lamedh. Forever, O LORD, Your word is settled in
heaven.&quot;  (Psalms 119:89, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The grass withers, the flower fades, But the word of our
God stands forever.&quot;  (Isaiah 40:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I know that everything God does will remain forever;
there is nothing to add to it and there is nothing to take from it, for God has
so worked that men should fear Him.&quot;  (Ecclesiastes 3:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s works are manifest in everything around us. Because
He never changes, we can count on God’s promises. Heb. 6:17-20. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;In the same way God, desiring even more to show to the
heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of His purpose, interposed with an
oath, so that by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to
lie, we who have taken refuge would have strong encouragement to take hold of
the hope set before us. This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, a hope both
sure and steadfast and one which enters within the veil, where Jesus has
entered as a forerunner for us, having become a high priest forever according
to the order of Melchizedek.&quot;  (Hebrews 6:17-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Word of God or the Bible is perfectly consistent in
the original languages that were inspired by the Holy Spirit and written by
human authors prior to 70 AD. The Bible reflects God’s thinking for mankind.
Scripture also presents to the human race God’s perfect and unchanging plan and
purpose for each of us. 1 Cor. 2:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL
INSTRUCT HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s immutability means that He always makes use of His
infinite power consistently with His perfect attributes and essence. His
perfect plan has never changed from eternity past to now. God does not change
His plan or His mind. Num. 23:19; 1 Sam. 15:29; Psalms 33:11. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;God is not a man, that He should lie, Nor a son of
man, that He should repent; Has He said, and will He not do it? Or has He
spoken, and will He not make it good?&quot;  (Numbers 23:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Also the Glory of Israel will not lie or change His
mind; for He is not a man that He should change His mind.&quot;&quot;  (1
Samuel 15:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The counsel of the LORD stands forever, The plans of His
heart from generation to generation.&quot;  (Psalms 33:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We see it merely unfolding around us as time passes.
Nothing God does is every arbitrary. None of His policies toward us are ever
arbitrary. Nothing of God or what He does is ever based on or affected by our
human responses. Everything He does is totally compatible with His plan and
purpose. Therefore, God's unchanging character and Word provide the basis for
our so unique spiritual life.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Erroneous Biblical Interpretation of Anthropopathisms</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Although God never changes, the Scripture sometimes
appears to say that God changes, becomes angry, and generally takes on human
failings and attributes. These are anthropopathisms. The dictionary defines an
anthropopathism as the attribution of human feelings to things not human, such
as inanimate objects, animals, or natural phenomena. In the Word of God,
anthropopathisms are used to ascribe to God human characteristics which He does
not actually possess in order to explain His divine policy in terms of our
limited frame of reference. Therefore, this is language of accommodation. It
does not really describe who and what God is.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some Bible verses such as 1 Samuel 15:35, Genesis 6:6,
Jeremiah 26:3, Psalms 44:23, and Exodus 32:14 seem to be counter to God’s
immutability principle, but these are anthropopathisms. The Bible is the
inerrant inspired word of God. The purpose of Scripture is to communicate God’s
plan and purpose to the human race. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Samuel did not see Saul again until the day of his death;
for Samuel grieved over Saul. And the LORD regretted that He had made Saul king
over Israel.&quot;  (1 Samuel 15:35, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The LORD was sorry that He had made man on the earth, and
He was grieved in His heart.&quot;  (Genesis 6:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;'Perhaps they will listen and everyone will turn from his
evil way, that I may repent of the calamity which I am planning to do to them
because of the evil of their deeds.'&quot;  (Jeremiah 26:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Arouse Yourself, why do You sleep, O Lord? Awake, do not
reject us forever.&quot;  (Psalms 44:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So the LORD changed His mind about the harm which He said
He would do to His people.&quot;  (Exodus 32:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When we change, which we always do, God may seem to
change in our view in certain passages of Scripture. This is because our frame
of reference has changed in some way. This changing frame of reference occurs
many times in the world around us. For example, if you are sitting in a train
traveling quickly down the tracks, you might observe someone next to the train
standing still. You appear to be moving to them, but they also appears to be
moving in the opposite direction because you are sitting still inside the
train. It’s all a matter of perspective. The reality is that God is not
changing and remains perfectly consistent with His own unchanging character. 
Also, He will handle different things in our lives in different ways, but
always consistent with His perfectly immutable character.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The problem with anthropopathisms that represent God in
the Bible is that they are misunderstood. They really represent the His perfect
attitude toward changes in man or history in human language so that we can
understand God’s policy. God does not get angry or hate. These sinful emotions
are human emotions. God has no emotions and is incapable of sinning or being
tempted to sin. He is perfect. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Erroneous Biblical Interpretation of Anthropomorphisms</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Another problem is that anthropomorphic representations
of God in the Bible are very often misunderstood. The dictionary defines
anthropomorphisms as attribution of human motivation, characteristics, or
behavior to inanimate objects, animals, or natural phenomena. In the Word of
God, anthropomorphisms are biblical figures of speech, which attribute human
motivation, characteristics, or behavior to God which He does not possess. They
actually represent God’s perfect attitude toward man’s variations or variations
in history in human language, so that man can understand God’s policy. God the
Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit do not actually possess hands as in
Colossians 3:1 and  Mark 16:19. God does not have eyes and ears as in Psalms
34:15-16 and Isaiah 1:15. God does not have wings as in Psalms 36:7. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore if you have been raised up with Christ, keep
seeking the things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of
God.&quot;  (Colossians 3:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So then, when the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, He was
received up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God.&quot;  (Mark
16:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The eyes of the LORD are toward the righteous And His
ears are open to their cry. The face of the LORD is against evildoers, To cut
off the memory of them from the earth.&quot;  (Psalms 34:15-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;So when you spread out your hands in prayer, I will
hide My eyes from you; Yes, even though you multiply prayers, I will not
listen. Your hands are covered with blood.&quot;  (Isaiah 1:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;How precious is Your lovingkindness, O God! And the
children of men take refuge in the shadow of Your wings.&quot;  (Psalms 36:7,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Unfolding of God’s Perfect Plan</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s perfect and unchanging plan is coming to fruition
for each of us as we live our lives. The fact that we see it unfolding before
our eyes does not mean that His plan is changing. It is simply happening as God
planned it in eternity past in its perfect detail and outcome. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God knew all the knowable in eternity past. This is
referred to as His omniscience. He also knew in eternity past all that could be
known including every detail of life’s actions and consequences. He knew all
that every human being would think, say, and do during their entire lives. He
also knew what every human being could have thought, could have said, could
have done, but did not. This principle also applies to all of God’s creatures.
He knew every action, consequence and reaction of every created thing and
object from eternity past as well. See category on the <a href="#_Plan_of_God">Plan
of God</a>.</p>
