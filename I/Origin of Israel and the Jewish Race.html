<h2>Origin of Israel and the Jewish Race</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are three words for the Jewish race: Hebrew, Jew,
and Israel. There are three categories of Jews. The racial Jew is anyone with
the genes of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The regenerate Jew is any Jew who has
accepted by faith the Messiah, Jesus Christ as their Savior. The religious Jew
is the non-regenerate Jew who chooses to reject Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All nations are founded on physical birth except the
nation Israel, which was founded on the new birth. For the first three
generations, the basis for the nation Israel was founded on regeneration. Abraham
was a Chaldean by natural birth. Through regeneration he became a Jew. He “crossed
over the river” and became a Hebrew or the first missionary.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Abraham was saved in Ur of the Chaldees as a Gentile. God’s
absolute righteousness (+R) was imputed to him upon faith belief and Abraham
was then justified by God the Father. Abraham was justified or vindicated in
the eyes of the unbeliever when he offered Isaac. James 2:21; Gen. 12:2; Deut.
7:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered
up Isaac his son on the altar?” (James 2:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And I will make you a great nation, And I will bless you, And
make your name great; And so you shall be a blessing;” (Genesis 12:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For you are a holy people to the LORD your God; the LORD
your God has chosen you to be a people for His own possession out of all the
peoples who are on the face of the earth.” (Deuteronomy 7:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the land of Canaan, Abraham was circumcised, which was
the sign that he was now a Jew. Abraham was the pattern for salvation in the
Old Testament for both Gentile and Jew as he was both a saved Gentile and a
saved Jew.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Abraham had two sons - Ishmael and Isaac. Ishmael (from
which comes the Arabic race) was not born-again and remained a Gentile. Isaac
was born-again and became a Jew. Isaac had two sons - Esau and Jacob. Esau was
not born-again and remained a Gentile. Jacob was born-again and became a Jew. All
of Jacob’s sons were racially Jews and formed the new nation of Israel. They
were also all believers and therefore regenerate Jews.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Abrahamic Covenant is based on regeneration, hence
the promises made to Abraham and believed by him can only be passed on to
another believer - in this case Isaac. Ishmael was the natural seed, but not the
spiritual seed of Abraham. Isaac was both natural seed and spiritual seed.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The will of God had not failed the Jews, but the Jews of
Paul’s day had failed the will of God by negative volition towards Jesus
Christ. Therefore, as natural or racial, but not spiritual seed of Abraham,
they could not receive God’s promises made to Abraham.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Physical decent or natural birth is worthless in
transmission of divine promises. They can only be transmitted in regeneration.
Likewise, Jacob and Esau have the same father and mother, but the difference
again is in spiritual birth.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All people born from then on through the Old Testament
and beyond were racial Jews, but not necessarily regenerate. The Jewish race
from the tribes of Israel on is based on genes, not on regeneration as in the
first three generations. This is why the phrase, “God of Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob” is often used. Others have the genes of Abraham, but not the genes of
Isaac and Jacob i.e., Arabs. The Jews are a race which does not lose
identification and is part of their discipline. </p>
