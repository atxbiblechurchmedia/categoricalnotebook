<h2>Imitators of God</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As members of the royal family of God, we should bear a
family resemblance. Gal. 3:26; 1 John 1:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ
Jesus.&quot;  (Galatians 3:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;What was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we
have seen with our eyes, what we have looked at and touched with our hands,
concerning the Word of Life—&quot;  (1 John 1:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ as God is the manifest person of the
Trinity. John 1:18; John 6:46; 1 Tim. 6:16; 1 John 4:12. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;No one has seen God at any time; the only begotten God
who is in the bosom of the Father, He has explained Him. &quot;  (John 1:18,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;Not that anyone has seen the Father, except the
One who is from God; He has seen the Father. &quot;  (John 6:46, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;who alone possesses immortality and dwells in
unapproachable light, whom no man has seen or can see. To Him be honor and
eternal dominion! Amen.&quot;  (1 Timothy 6:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;No one has seen God at any time; if we love one another,
God abides in us, and His love is perfected in us.&quot;  (1 John 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ as humanity set the pattern for the filling
of the Holy Spirit. In His humanity, Jesus Christ was the most perfectly
adjusted person. Luke 2:40; Luke 2:52.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved
children;&quot;  (Ephesians 5:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And Jesus kept increasing in wisdom and stature, and in
favor with God and men.&quot;  (Luke 2:52, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers are commanded to become imitators of the
manifest person of the Godhead, Jesus Christ. Eph. 5:1; Gal. 4:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved
children;&quot;  (Ephesians 5:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;My children, with whom I am again in labor until Christ
is formed in you—&quot;  (Galatians 4:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This command can only be executed when the believer is
filled with the Holy Spirit. Gal. 3:16-17; Phil. 1:20-21.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed.
He does not say, &quot;And to seeds,&quot; as referring to many, but rather to
one, &quot;And to your seed,&quot; that is, Christ. What I am saying is this:
the Law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, does not invalidate a
covenant previously ratified by God, so as to nullify the promise.&quot; 
(Galatians 3:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;according to my earnest expectation and hope, that I will
not be put to shame in anything, but that with all boldness, Christ will even
now, as always, be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death. For to me,
to live is Christ and to die is gain.&quot;  (Philippians 1:20-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is compatible with the ministry of the Holy Spirit
in the Church Age. John 7:39; John 16:14; 1 Cor. 6:19-20.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But this He spoke of the Spirit, whom those who believed
in Him were to receive; for the Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not
yet glorified.&quot;  (John 7:39, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;He will glorify Me, for He will take of Mine and
will disclose it to you. &quot;  (John 16:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy
Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and that you are not your own?
For you have been bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your
body.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 6:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The filling of the Holy Spirit produces the character of
Jesus Christ in the believer. This fulfills the command to become imitators of
Jesus Christ. Gal. 5:22-23; 2 Cor. 3:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,
patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against
such things there is no law.&quot;  (Galatians 5:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;being manifested that you are a letter of Christ, cared
for by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on
tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 3:3,
NASB)</p>
