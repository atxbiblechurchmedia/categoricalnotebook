<h2>Israel’s Responsibility and Failure</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Once internationalism was outlawed in Tower of Babel
incident in Genesis 11 and with the inauguration of nationalism, we have a
scattering of nations geographically, linguistically, and racially. This
demands missionary activity. Abraham was the first foreign missionary. He was born
a Gentile and became a Jew by faith belief in the future Messiah, Jesus Christ.
Gen. 15:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the LORD
confused the language of the whole earth; and from there the LORD scattered
them abroad over the face of the whole earth.” (Genesis 11:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then he believed in the LORD; and He reckoned it to him as
righteousness.” (Genesis 15:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first title for a missionary was “Hebrew,” which
means “one who crosses over the river.” Abraham became a Hebrew. He crossed
over the River Euphrates and came into Canaan and evangelized. Converts were
Aner, Mamre, Eshcol and many others. Gen. 14:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then a fugitive came and told Abram the Hebrew. Now he was
living by the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and brother of Aner,
and these were allies with Abram.” (Genesis 14:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Age of Israel, Jews were responsible for
custodianship of the Word and dissemination of the Gospel. Rom. 3:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Great in every respect. First of all, that they were entrusted
with the oracles of God.” (Romans 3:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Israel was a missionary base because they had
custodianship of the Word. Those who became born-again were to grow in grace
and knowledge of the Savior and to evangelize. Jews were to go to the Gentiles
and bring them the message of the Gospel. An example was Jonah.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first failure was when Jews generally failed to
accept the Messiah to come, Jesus Christ as Savior. Instead, they accepted the
Mosaic Law as a way of salvation and sought human righteousness as the basis of
salvation rather than divine righteousness, which can only be credited to the
individual on the basis of faith in Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The second failure was having failed at the point of
salvation, they failed at the point of missions. You cannot become a missionary
unless you are born-again. Their failure led to a change in dispensation and in
administrators and the fifth cycle of discipline for Israel. During their fifth
cycle of discipline, the Church is the missionary base.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Even though Israel failed, God used other means and
Gentiles were saved in Old Testament times. Rom. 9:30-33. </p>

<p class=Verses>“What shall we say then? That Gentiles, who did not pursue
righteousness, attained righteousness, even the righteousness which is by
faith; but Israel, pursuing a law of righteousness, did not arrive at that law.
Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as though it were by works.
They stumbled over the stumbling stone, just as it is written, &quot;BEHOLD, I
LAY IN ZION A STONE OF STUMBLING AND A ROCK OF OFFENSE, AND HE WHO BELIEVES IN
HIM WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.&quot;” (Romans 9:30-33, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In fact, probably more Gentiles were saved in the Old
Testament than Jews according to this passage. Jews had a perfect system for
disseminating the Gospel: Levitical feasts, offerings, Holy Days, etc. They
will again evangelize during the Tribulation. This is part of their future.</p>
