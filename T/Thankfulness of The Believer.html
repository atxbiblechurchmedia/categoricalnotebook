<h2>Thankfulness of The Believer</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Thanksgiving and grace are synonyms and both speak of a
gracious mental attitude. This results in an attitude which does not take anything
in life for granted. Do not take your freedom for granted. In the USA, we
currently have the freedom to attend the church of our choice. We have freedom
to live where we desire. We have freedom to pursue the vocation of our liking. We
have the freedom to make friends with whom we wish. 1 Peter 2:6; John 4:24.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this is contained in Scripture: &quot;BEHOLD, I LAY IN
ZION A CHOICE STONE, A PRECIOUS CORNER stone, AND HE WHO BELIEVES IN HIM WILL
NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.&quot;” (1 Peter 2:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in
spirit and truth.&quot;” (John 4:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You should not take your marriage for granted. The biggest
problem in marriage is time. The next biggest problem in marriage is duration. The
next biggest problem is distraction. The next biggest problem in marriage is
administration. Here is the principle of headship and authority orientation. 1
Cor. 7:29; 1 Cor. 7:35; Eph. 5:18-21; Eph. 5:22-24; Eph. 5:25-26; Eph. 5:28-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But this I say, brethren, the time has been shortened, so that
from now on those who have wives should be as though they had none;” (1
Corinthians 7:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“This I say for your own benefit; not to put a restraint upon
you, but to promote what is appropriate and to secure undistracted devotion to
the Lord.” (1 Corinthians 7:35, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but
be filled with the Spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and
spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord; always
giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even
the Father; and be subject to one another in the fear of Christ.” (Ephesians
5:18-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord. For
the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church,
He Himself being the Savior of the body. But as the church is subject to
Christ, so also the wives ought to be to their husbands in everything.”
(Ephesians 5:22-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the
church and gave Himself up for her, so that He might sanctify her, having
cleansed her by the washing of water with the word,” (Ephesians 5:25-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own
bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself; for no one ever hated his own
flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also does the church,”
(Ephesians 5:28-29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You should not take your family for granted. Teach your
children to respect authority. Teach them self-discipline and to accept
responsibility for their talk and actions. Teach them the principle of hard
work in business and to finish a task once it is started. Teach them the right
of private ownership and private enterprise. Prov. 30:11; Prov. 30:17; Eph.
6:1-4; 2 Thess. 3:10; 1 Tim. 6:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“There is a kind of man who curses his father And does not
bless his mother.” (Proverbs 30:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The eye that mocks a father And scorns a mother, The ravens of
the valley will pick it out, And the young eagles will eat it.” (Proverbs
30:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.
HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER (which is the first commandment with a promise),
SO THAT IT MAY BE WELL WITH YOU, AND THAT YOU MAY LIVE LONG ON THE EARTH.
Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the
discipline and instruction of the Lord.” (Ephesians 6:1-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For even when we were with you, we used to give you this
order: if anyone is not willing to work, then he is not to eat, either.” (2
Thessalonians 3:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“All who are under the yoke as slaves are to regard their own
masters as worthy of all honor so that the name of God and our doctrine will
not be spoken against. Those who have believers as their masters must not be
disrespectful to them because they are brethren, but must serve them all the
more, because those who partake of the benefit are believers and beloved. Teach
and preach these principles.” (1 Timothy 6:1-2, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You should not take for granted the twin virtues of
honesty and integrity. <span lang=EL>Τ</span>he entire book of Proverbs. You
should avoid the so-called legal dishonesty we see so much of today. Micah 4:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Each of them will sit under his vine And under his fig tree,
With no one to make them afraid, For the mouth of the LORD of hosts has
spoken.” (Micah 4:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You should not take your nation for granted. A nation
rises and falls on the basis of its attitude toward the Word of God. A nation
rises and falls on the basis of the respect that people have for its laws.</p>
