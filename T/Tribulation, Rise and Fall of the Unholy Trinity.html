<h2>Tribulation, Rise and Fall of the Unholy Trinity</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The unholy trinity will be made up of Satan, the Dictator
of the Revived Roman Empire, and the Dictator of Palestine. The two dictators
go to battle at Armageddon. Rev. 16:13-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the
mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean
spirits like frogs; for they are spirits of demons, performing signs, which go
out to the kings of the whole world, to gather them together for the war of the
great day of God, the Almighty.” (Revelation 16:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They are utterly defeated by Jesus Christ at Armageddon
and are the first to be cast into the Lake of Fire. Rev. 19:20. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And the beast was seized, and with him the false prophet who
performed the signs in his presence, by which he deceived those who had
received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image; these two
were thrown alive into the lake of fire which burns with brimstone.”
(Revelation 19:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They will still be there at the end of the Millennium
when Satan will be cast into the Lake of Fire. Therefore, we know that the Lake
of Fire is eternal punishment and that the soul lives forever. Rev. 20:10. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of
fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also; and they
will be tormented day and night forever and ever.” (Revelation 20:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Satan</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan has four names. In Revelation 16:13 and Revelation
12:4, “the dragon” refers to Satan’s tremendous power. In Revelation 12:9, “the
serpent of old” refers to Satan. Whenever Satan is referred to as a serpent, it
is always referring to the devil’s activities whereby man became a sinner. “The
devil” refers to Satan as a slanderer and maligner. The Greek word here for
“Satan” is <span lang=EL>Σατανα</span>͂<span lang=EL>ς</span> (Satanas) and is
a transliteration from the Hebrew word <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>שׂטן</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>(śâṭân) meaning adversary, opponent, accuser, or enemy.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the
mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean
spirits like frogs;” (Revelation 16:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And his tail swept away a third of the stars of heaven and
threw them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to
give birth, so that when she gave birth he might devour her child.” (Revelation
12:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the great dragon was thrown down, the serpent of old who
is called the devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was thrown down
to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.” (Revelation 12:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan is the basic enemy of the believer and God. Satan
is the chief antagonist in the Angelic Conflict. Satan’s original status is
found in Ezekiel 28:12-14. Satan is a cherub. Originally he was the defender of
divine essence, guarding the throne room of God. He was replaced by four
angels.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Son of man, take up a lamentation over the king of Tyre
and say to him, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, &quot;You had the seal of perfection,
Full of wisdom and perfect in beauty. &quot;You were in Eden, the garden of
God; Every precious stone was your covering: The ruby, the topaz and the
diamond; The beryl, the onyx and the jasper; The lapis lazuli, the turquoise
and the emerald; And the gold, the workmanship of your settings and sockets,
Was in you. On the day that you were created They were prepared. &quot;You were
the anointed cherub who covers, And I placed you there. You were on the holy
mountain of God; You walked in the midst of the stones of fire.” (Ezekiel
28:12-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan’s first fall is in Ezekiel 28:15. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You were blameless in your ways From the day you were
created Until unrighteousness was found in you.” (Ezekiel 28:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan is operative now along with his fallen angels or demons.
Satan continues this type of operation until the middle of the Tribulation when
we see Satan’s second fall. Ezekiel 28:16; Rev. 12:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;By the abundance of your trade You were internally
filled with violence, And you sinned; Therefore I have cast you as profane From
the mountain of God. And I have destroyed you, O covering cherub, From the
midst of the stones of fire.” (Ezekiel 28:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the great dragon was thrown down, the serpent of old who
is called the devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was thrown down
to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.” (Revelation 12:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the Second Advent of Jesus Christ, He binds Satan for
the 1,000 years of the Millennium during the time of perfect environment on
earth. Rev. 20:1-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding the key
of the abyss and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold of the dragon, the
serpent of old, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years;
and he threw him into the abyss, and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he
would not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were
completed; after these things he must be released for a short time.”
(Revelation 20:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan is released at the end of the 1,000 years and
causes the Gog and Magog Revolt, which proves that perfect environment is not
the answer. Fire comes down from heaven and ends the revolt completely. Rev.
20:7-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“When the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released
from his prison, and will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four
corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for the war; the
number of them is like the sand of the seashore. And they came up on the broad
plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city,
and fire came down from heaven and devoured them. And the devil who deceived
them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the
false prophet are also; and they will be tormented day and night forever and
ever.” (Revelation 20:7-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan is cast into the Lake of Fire at the end of the
Millennium. This is the final fall of Satan. Rev. 20:10; Matt. 25:41; Ezekiel
28:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of
fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also; and they
will be tormented day and night forever and ever.” (Revelation 20:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Then He will also say to those on His left, 'Depart from
Me, accursed ones, into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil
and his angels;” (Matthew 25:41, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;By the multitude of your iniquities, In the
unrighteousness of your trade You profaned your sanctuaries. Therefore I have
brought fire from the midst of you; It has consumed you, And I have turned you
to ashes on the earth In the eyes of all who see you.” (Ezekiel 28:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Dictator of the Revived Roman Empire </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan, as the ruler of this world, made a bona fide offer
to Jesus Christ in Matthew 4:8-10. Christ rejected his offer. Again he will offer
the kingdoms of the world - this time to the Dictator of the Revived Roman
Empire who will accept the offer. His fall is prophesied in Revelation 13:10.
His fall will occur in Revelation 19:20. See category on <a
href="#_D-The_Two_Beasts_1">The Two Beasts of the Tribulation</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Again, the devil took Him to a very high mountain and showed
Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory; and he said to Him,
&quot;All these things I will give You, if You fall down and worship me.&quot;
Then Jesus said to him, &quot;Go, Satan! For it is written, 'YOU SHALL WORSHIP
THE LORD YOUR GOD, AND SERVE HIM ONLY.'&quot;” (Matthew 4:8-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“If anyone is destined for captivity, to captivity he goes; if
anyone kills with the sword, with the sword he must be killed. Here is the
perseverance and the faith of the saints.” (Revelation 13:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the beast was seized, and with him the false prophet who
performed the signs in his presence, by which he deceived those who had
received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image; these two
were thrown alive into the lake of fire which burns with brimstone.”
(Revelation 19:20, NASB)</p>
