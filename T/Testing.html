<h2><a name="_Testing"></a><a name="_D-The_Testimony_of"></a><a
name="_Testing_1"></a>Testing</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Tests are designed to reveal your true character to
yourself. Tests are designed to reveal in overt activity your invisible
capability. Tests when passed are designed to enhance relationships and rapport
between individual believers. Tests are designed to bring doctrine into action
that possibly has only been learned and never applied.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Tests of one person can bring a great deal of pressure on
others and sooner or later they become involved in the tests. Tests often come
in series and often in many different ways. Tests can be recognized by
believers with doctrine who stay in fellowship and do not form conclusions
until they get all the facts.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The higher the spiritual growth level of the believer,
the more sophisticated and challenging the tests become. Tests can ride in on
the tail of a seemingly neutral issue or problem. That which may be interpreted
on the surface as expressing one thing will give a totally different picture
when viewed from the standpoint of a specific test for a certain believer or
set of believers.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In local churches, sometimes tests are congregation
oriented, other times pastor oriented, other times staff oriented or deacon board
oriented. In the face of a test, divine wisdom is shown in not being hasty in
word or decision until all factors can be isolated.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Often it takes the ministry of several spiritual gifts
over some time to isolate a certain type of sophisticated test. The passing of
tests often and most always results in more stability than was present before
the test was faced. Believers who pass tests come out on the other side of the
pipe stronger not weaker than when they went into it.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><a name="_Proof_From_Testing"></a><b>Volition Under
Testing </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pattern of volition and its testing was established
in the Garden of Eden. You may eat of everything with one exception. The fruit
of this tree you may not eat. The composition of volition in choosing good or
evil makes it possible to be tested. However, to test volition just for the
sake of testing is no issue. Testing volition is in God’s plan because of the
Angelic Conflict. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In eternity past, God created angels with volition. One
angel chose to react to God’s plan and refuse it. He believed the way of good
via God’s plan was not superior to his way of evil, Satan’s plan. Therefore, a
conflict began to rage. Is God’s plan of divine good superior to Satan’s plan
of angelic and human good? A period of time was given for the platform of God
to be explained and the platform of Satan. Eph. 1; Isaiah 14.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Those angels who chose for Satan exercised negative
volition. Those who chose for God exercised positive volition. The angels were
confirmed in negative and positive volition. Heb. 2:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For if the word spoken through angels proved unalterable, and
every transgression and disobedience received a just penalty,” (Hebrews 2:2,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God and elect angels operate under a plan of positive
volition. Satan and fallen angels operate under a program of negative volition.
Two ways of life were offered to Adam and the woman in the Garden. They were
tested in these two options while in innocence. God presented Bible doctrine to
Adam and the woman (later called Eve after the Fall) in the cool of the day.
Satan via the serpent presented his challenge to Bible doctrine in the cool of
the day (before Bible class). The woman got the message to Adam immediately. He
listened. Then, they did not show up for Bible class with God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This challenge was a test because Adam was equipped to
make a choice. Did he really believe what God had taught based on who God is or
did he believe what Eve said because of who she was and who Satan is? A test is
designed for confirmation of what you actually believe or disbelieve. Once a
test is passed, there is a confirmation of belief in Bible doctrine resident in
the right lobe of the soul. Heb. 2.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Greek Words For Testing</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i><u>Adokimos </u></i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 1:28, “depraved” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span
lang=EL>δο</span>́<span lang=EL>κιμος</span> (adokimos) and refers to an
unbeliever who has <i>epignosis</i> understanding of the Gospel and has
rejected it.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any
longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do those things which are not
proper,” (Romans 1:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 9:27, “disqualified” refers to a
believer reaching spiritual maturity and failing to pass tests resulting in
reversionism. </p>

<p class=Verses>“but I discipline my body and make it my slave, so that, after
I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified.” (1 Corinthians
9:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 13:5-7, “do not fail the test” is not
the normal life of the believer, but following the program of Satan with a
Christian vocabulary. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Test yourselves to see if you are in the faith; examine
yourselves! Or do you not recognize this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is
in you—unless indeed you fail the test? But I trust that you will realize that
we ourselves do not fail the test. Now we pray to God that you do no wrong; not
that we ourselves may appear approved, but that you may do what is right, even
though we may appear unapproved.” (2 Corinthians 13:5-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Timothy 3:8, “rejected” is equated with
subjectivity, signs, and hustle but most of all with no spiritual maturity.
Therefore, this word best describes the believer leaving God’s plan in the
Church Age. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men also
oppose the truth, men of depraved mind, rejected in regard to the faith.” (2
Timothy 3:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Titus 1:16, “worthless” is the title attached to
pseudo-spiritual production, hustle, etc. </p>

<p class=Verses>“They profess to know God, but by their deeds they deny Him,
being detestable and disobedient and worthless for any good deed.” (Titus 1:16,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 6:8, “worthless” indicates God’s rejection of
a believer’s production which is not based on God’s plan.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but if it yields thorns and thistles, it is worthless and
close to being cursed, and it ends up being burned.” (Hebrews 6:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i><u>Dokimos </u></i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 10:18, “approved” is <span lang=EL>δο</span>́<span
lang=EL>κιμος</span> (dokimos) and refers to testing for the purpose of passing
the test. It is God’s will for the believer to pass the test.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For it is not he who commends himself that is approved, but he
whom the Lord commends.” (2 Corinthians 10:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Timothy 2:15, “approved” refers to the studying of
God’s plan as the greatest encouragement toward living the spiritual life. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman
who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth.” (2
Timothy 2:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In James 1:12, “approved” refers to confirmation of the
believer’s concept of passing tests on earth will be given at the Judgment Seat
of Christ. This is also a confirmation of positive volition.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Blessed is a man who perseveres under trial; for once he has
been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to
those who love Him.” (James 1:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i><u>Dokimazō </u></i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 1:28, “did not see fit to acknowledge God” is <span
lang=EL>ου</span>̓ (ou) plus <span lang=EL>δοκιμα</span>́<span lang=EL>ζω</span>
(dokimazō) and refers to the unbeliever negative to the Gospel who will not
approve of God’s plan in their thinking.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any
longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do those things which are not
proper,” (Romans 1:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 2:18, “approved” is used in a sarcastic sense
of apostates who use Christian vocabulary to prove they know God’s will.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and know His will and approve the things that are essential,
being instructed out of the Law,” (Romans 2:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 14:22, “approves” means that living is relaxed
living. </p>

<p class=Verses>“The faith which you have, have as your own conviction before
God. Happy is he who does not condemn himself in what he approves.” (Romans
14:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 16:3, “approval” refers to approval of
men of integrity to carry an offering to Jerusalem. </p>

<p class=Verses>“When I arrive, whomever you may approve, I will send them with
letters to carry your gift to Jerusalem;” (1 Corinthians 16:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 8:8, “proving” refers to overt
expressions of the spiritual life, the passing of tests involving the mental
attitude motivation of grace when giving.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I am not speaking this as a command, but as proving through
the earnestness of others the sincerity of your love also.” (2 Corinthians 8:8,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 8:22, “tested” refers to Titus who
passed many tests in his ministry as a communicator of Bible doctrine. </p>

<p class=Verses>“We have sent with them our brother, whom we have often tested
and found diligent in many things, but now even more diligent because of his
great confidence in you.” (2 Corinthians 8:22, NASB)</p>
