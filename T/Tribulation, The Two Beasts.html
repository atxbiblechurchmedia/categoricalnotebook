<h2>Tribulation, The Two Beasts </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The First Beast – The Dictator of the Revived Roman
Empire</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The First Beast’s political function will be the Dictator
of the Revived Roman Empire, the king of the West. Racially he will be a
Gentile. Religiously he will be the head of the World Council of Churches, the
ecumenical religion of the Tribulation. Rev. 13:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And the dragon stood on the sand of the seashore. Then I
saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and on
his horns were ten diadems, and on his heads were blasphemous names.&quot; 
(Revelation 13:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He is called a beast because he will be demon possessed.
In his thought pattern and modus operandi, he will be like a wild animal. He
will be under the direct jurisdiction of Satan. Rev. 16:1; Rev. 13:2. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon and out
of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three
unclean spirits like frogs;&quot;  (Revelation 16:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his
feet were like those of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. And the
dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority.&quot; 
(Revelation 13:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He will perform miracles. The demon who will indwell,
motivate and empower this dictator is one of the highest rank of all fallen
angels. In Revelation 9:11, this demon is called “Apollyon” and “Abaddon” and
refers to the angel in command of fallen angels in the bottomless pit. In
Revelation 11:7, <span lang=EL>θηρι</span>́<span lang=EL>ον</span> (thērion)
means a beast or wild animal and is used for this dictator because he will act
like a wild animal. Rev. 17:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;They have as king over them, the angel of the abyss; his
name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in the Greek he has the name Apollyon.&quot; 
(Revelation 9:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When they have finished their testimony, the beast that
comes up out of the abyss will make war with them, and overcome them and kill
them.&quot;  (Revelation 11:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints,
and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. When I saw her, I wondered
greatly.&quot;  (Revelation 17:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Other Names For the Dictator of the Revived Roman
Empire</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The “Antichrist.” The “king of the West” in the
Armageddon Campaign. The “Beast” in Revelation 13:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his
feet were like those of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. And the
dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority.&quot; 
(Revelation 13:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The “man of lawlessness” and the “son of destruction” in
2 Thessalonians 2:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Let no one in any way deceive you, for it will not come
unless the apostasy comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the
son of destruction,&quot;  (2 Thessalonians 2:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He will be the “beast coming up out of the sea” in
Revelation 13:1. This will be his political title. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And the dragon stood on the sand of the seashore. Then I
saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and on
his horns were ten diadems, and on his heads were blasphemous names.&quot; 
(Revelation 13:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He will be the rider of the white horse in Revelation
6:2. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I looked, and behold, a white horse, and he who sat on it
had a bow; and a crown was given to him, and he went out conquering and to
conquer.&quot;  (Revelation 6:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He will be the scarlet beast with seven heads and ten
horns in Revelation 17:3. This will be his religious title.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And he carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness;
and I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast, full of blasphemous names, having
seven heads and ten horns.&quot;  (Revelation 17:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He will be the Abomination of Desolation in Matthew
24:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Therefore when you see the ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION which
was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let the
reader understand),”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 24:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He will be the useless shepherd of Zechariah 11:15-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The LORD said to me, &quot;Take again for yourself the
equipment of a foolish shepherd. &quot;For behold, I am going to raise up a
shepherd in the land who will not care for the perishing, seek the scattered,
heal the broken, or sustain the one standing, but will devour the flesh of the
fat sheep and tear off their hoofs. &quot;Woe to the worthless shepherd Who
leaves the flock! A sword will be on his arm And on his right eye! His arm will
be totally withered And his right eye will be blind.&quot;&quot;  (Zechariah
11:15-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He will be the little horn in Daniel 7:8-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;While I was contemplating the horns, behold,
another horn, a little one, came up among them, and three of the first horns
were pulled out by the roots before it; and behold, this horn possessed eyes
like the eyes of a man and a mouth uttering great boasts. &quot;I kept looking
Until thrones were set up, And the Ancient of Days took His seat; His vesture
was like white snow And the hair of His head like pure wool. His throne was
ablaze with flames, Its wheels were a burning fire.&quot;  (Daniel 7:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He will be an insolent king skilled in intrigue in Daniel
8:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;In the latter period of their rule, When the
transgressors have run their course, A king will arise, Insolent and skilled in
intrigue.&quot;  (Daniel 8:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He will be the prince who is to come in Daniel 9:26-27.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Then after the sixty-two weeks the Messiah will be
cut off and have nothing, and the people of the prince who is to come will
destroy the city and the sanctuary. And its end will come with a flood; even to
the end there will be war; desolations are determined. &quot;And he will make a
firm covenant with the many for one week, but in the middle of the week he will
put a stop to sacrifice and grain offering; and on the wing of abominations
will come one who makes desolate, even until a complete destruction, one that
is decreed, is poured out on the one who makes desolate.&quot;&quot;  (Daniel
9:26-27, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He will be the leader of Tyre in Ezekiel 28:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Son of man, say to the leader of Tyre, 'Thus says
the Lord GOD, &quot;Because your heart is lifted up And you have said, 'I am a
god, I sit in the seat of gods In the heart of the seas'; Yet you are a man and
not God, Although you make your heart like the heart of God—&quot;  (Ezekiel
28:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>His empire is described as the image’s feet partly of
iron and partly of clay in Daniel 2:32-33.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;The head of that statue was made of fine gold, its
breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of bronze, its legs of
iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay.&quot;  (Daniel 2:32-33, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>2 Thessalonians 2 coupled with Revelation 13:1-10 gives
us a picture of a very brilliant person, a man who will create a marvelous
public relations image, a man who will be very handsome, even as Satan himself.
The world will be astounded at his fantastic rise to power. Rev. 13:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I saw one of his heads as if it had been slain, and his
fatal wound was healed. And the whole earth was amazed and followed after the
beast;&quot;  (Revelation 13:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Second Beast – The Dictator of Palestine</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Jewish Dictator of Palestine in the Tribulation may
also be called an antichrist because he tries to pass himself off as Jesus
Christ. He too will be controlled by Satan. He will come to the Jews and will
deceive them into thinking he is the Messiah. He will counterfeit the Lord
Jesus Christ “like a lamb” in Revelation 13:11. Dan. 11:37.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth; and
he had two horns like a lamb and he spoke as a dragon.&quot;  (Revelation
13:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;He will show no regard for the gods of his fathers
or for the desire of women, nor will he show regard for any other god; for he
will magnify himself above them all.&quot;  (Daniel 11:37, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Dictator of Palestine will rise to power at the same
time as the first beast. He will control Palestine and will establish
Neo-Judaism. He will seek an alliance at the middle of the Tribulation with the
Dictator of the Revived Roman Empire because he will need help. The Dictator of
Palestine will cause the Mark of the Beast to be accepted in Palestine causing
the loss of freedom. Rev. 13:16-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And he causes all, the small and the great, and the rich
and the poor, and the free men and the slaves, to be given a mark on their
right hand or on their forehead, and he provides that no one will be able to
buy or to sell, except the one who has the mark, either the name of the beast
or the number of his name.&quot;  (Revelation 13:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He will set himself up as the Savior. Dan. 11:36. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Then the king will do as he pleases, and he will
exalt and magnify himself above every god and will speak monstrous things
against the God of gods; and he will prosper until the indignation is finished,
for that which is decreed will be done.&quot;  (Daniel 11:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He will divide the land for gain. Dan. 11:39.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;He will take action against the strongest of
fortresses with the help of a foreign god; he will give great honor to those
who acknowledge him and will cause them to rule over the many, and will parcel
out land for a price.&quot;  (Daniel 11:39, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In this way he will make himself an antichrist - instead
of Christ and against Christ. He will also be under the jurisdiction of Satan
who will give him his power. Rev. 13:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his
feet were like those of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. And the
dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority.&quot; 
(Revelation 13:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He is called a beast because he will have uncontrolled
rule over many people. He will perform miracles, etc. Rev. 13:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He performs great signs, so that he even makes fire come
down out of heaven to the earth in the presence of men.&quot;  (Revelation
13:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Other Names for the Dictator of Palestine </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Dictator of Palestine is called “the false prophet”
in Revelation 16:13, Revelation 19:20, and Revelation 20:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon and out
of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three
unclean spirits like frogs;&quot;  (Revelation 16:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And the beast was seized, and with him the false prophet
who performed the signs in his presence, by which he deceived those who had
received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image; these two
were thrown alive into the lake of fire which burns with brimstone.&quot; 
(Revelation 19:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake
of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also; and they
will be tormented day and night forever and ever.&quot;  (Revelation 20:10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Dictator of Palestine is called “another beast coming
up out of the earth” in Revelation 13:11 or the “Second Beast.” The Dictator of
Palestine is called “the king” in Daniel 11:36-40.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth; and
he had two horns like a lamb and he spoke as a dragon.&quot;  (Revelation
13:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Then the king will do as he pleases, and he will
exalt and magnify himself above every god and will speak monstrous things
against the God of gods; and he will prosper until the indignation is finished,
for that which is decreed will be done.&quot;  (Daniel 11:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Dictator of Palestine is called a “serpent” and a “horned
snake” in Genesis 49:17. He will be from the tribe of Dan and is the serpent
that bites the horse’s heels. Gen. 49:16-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Dan shall be a serpent in the way, A horned snake
in the path, That bites the horse's heels, So that his rider falls
backward.&quot;  (Genesis 49:17, NASB)</p>
