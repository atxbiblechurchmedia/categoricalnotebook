<h2>Pre-Tribulation or Post-Tribulation Rapture?</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The purpose of the Tribulation will be to prepare the
nation of Israel for the Messiah and to pour judgment on unbelieving man and
nations.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><img width=550 height=450 id="Picture 1"
src="Pre-Tribulation%20or%20Post-Tribulation%20Rapture.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In every dispensation, believers have had tribulation in
their lives. In fact, tribulation is very intense for believers during the
Church Age because of the Angelic Conflict. Every believer is a target of Satan
and his demons. However, the Tribulation is a time of preparation for Israel’s
restoration, not the Church for glory. None of the Old Testament passages on
the Tribulation mention the Church. Deut. 4:29-30; Jer. 30:4-11; Dan 9:24-27;
Dan 12:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But from there you will seek the LORD your God, and you
will find Him if you search for Him with all your heart and all your soul.
&quot;When you are in distress and all these things have come upon you, in the
latter days you will return to the LORD your God and listen to His voice.”
(Deuteronomy 4:29-30, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Seventy weeks have been decreed for your people and your
holy city, to finish the transgression, to make an end of sin, to make
atonement for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up
vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy place. &quot;So you are to know
and discern that from the issuing of a decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem
until Messiah the Prince there will be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks; it will
be built again, with plaza and moat, even in times of distress. &quot;Then after
the sixty-two weeks the Messiah will be cut off and have nothing, and the
people of the prince who is to come will destroy the city and the sanctuary.
And its end will come with a flood; even to the end there will be war;
desolations are determined. &quot;And he will make a firm covenant with the
many for one week, but in the middle of the week he will put a stop to
sacrifice and grain offering; and on the wing of abominations will come one who
makes desolate, even until a complete destruction, one that is decreed, is
poured out on the one who makes desolate.&quot;” (Daniel 9:24-27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Now at that time Michael, the great prince who stands
guard over the sons of your people, will arise. And there will be a time of
distress such as never occurred since there was a nation until that time; and
at that time your people, everyone who is found written in the book, will be
rescued. &quot;Many of those who sleep in the dust of the ground will awake,
these to everlasting life, but the others to disgrace and everlasting
contempt.” (Daniel 12:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>None of the New Testament passages on the Tribulation
mention the Church. The Rapture of the Church is never mentioned in any passage
dealing with the Second Advent of Christ after the Tribulation. Matt. 24; 1
Thess. 1:9-10; 1 Thess. 5:4-9; Rev. 4 - 19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For they themselves report about us what kind of a reception
we had with you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve a living and
true God, and to wait for His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead,
that is Jesus, who rescues us from the wrath to come.” (1 Thessalonians 1:9-10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But you, brethren, are not in darkness, that the day would
overtake you like a thief; for you are all sons of light and sons of day. We
are not of night nor of darkness; so then let us not sleep as others do, but
let us be alert and sober. For those who sleep do their sleeping at night, and
those who get drunk get drunk at night. But since we are of the day, let us be
sober, having put on the breastplate of faith and love, and as a helmet, the
hope of salvation. For God has not destined us for wrath, but for obtaining
salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,” (1 Thessalonians 5:4-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The leading exponent of the Post-Tribulational view
George Ladd in his book, “The Blessed Hope,” page 165 says, “With the exception
of one passage, the author will grant that the Scripture nowhere explicitly
states that the Church will go through the Great Tribulation. God’s people are
seen in the Tribulation, but they are not called the Church but the elect or
the saints. Nor does the Word explicitly place the Rapture at the end of the
Tribulation. Most of the references to these final events lack chronological
indications. However, in one passage, Rev 20, the Resurrection is placed at the
return of Christ in glory. This is more than an inference.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If the Word of God is our final authority, shouldn’t
there be more Scriptural documentation for a Post-Tribulational view than this
stated above? The fact that Revelation 20 states there is a resurrection after
the Tribulation is true. However, it is not referring to the Rapture of the
Church, but the resurrection of Old Testament saints.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A proper literal interpretation of Daniel’s 70 weeks, Daniel
9:24-27, finds that 69 of them are historically fulfilled, but the last week (“week”
means seven years) is yet future. Daniel’s prophecy refers to Israel. The Age
of Israel stops at the Cross, seven years short, and is picked up again after
the Rapture of the Church. The Tribulation is Jewish in flavor, not the Church.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Seventy weeks have been decreed for your people and your
holy city, to finish the transgression, to make an end of sin, to make
atonement for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up
vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy place. &quot;So you are to know
and discern that from the issuing of a decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem
until Messiah the Prince there will be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks; it will
be built again, with plaza and moat, even in times of distress. &quot;Then after
the sixty-two weeks the Messiah will be cut off and have nothing, and the
people of the prince who is to come will destroy the city and the sanctuary.
And its end will come with a flood; even to the end there will be war;
desolations are determined. &quot;And he will make a firm covenant with the
many for one week, but in the middle of the week he will put a stop to
sacrifice and grain offering; and on the wing of abominations will come one who
makes desolate, even until a complete destruction, one that is decreed, is
poured out on the one who makes desolate.&quot;” (Daniel 9:24-27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Church is not appointed to the wrath to be poured out
on Israel and unsaved Gentiles. Rom. 5:9; 1 Thess. 1:9-10; 1 Thess. 5:9. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we
shall be saved from the wrath of God through Him.” (Romans 5:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For they themselves report about us what kind of a reception
we had with you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve a living and
true God, and to wait for His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead,
that is Jesus, who rescues us from the wrath to come.” (1 Thessalonians 1:9-10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For God has not destined us for wrath, but for obtaining
salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,” (1 Thessalonians 5:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Church therefore cannot enter “the great day of their
wrath.” Rev. 6:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“for the great day of their wrath has come, and who is able to
stand?&quot;” (Revelation 6:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Church will not be overtaken by the Day of the Lord,
which includes the Tribulation. 1 Thess. 5:1-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For you yourselves know full well that the day of the Lord
will come just like a thief in the night. While they are saying, &quot;Peace
and safety!&quot; then destruction will come upon them suddenly like labor
pains upon a woman with child, and they will not escape.” (1 Thessalonians
5:2-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But you, brethren, are not in darkness, that the day would
overtake you like a thief;” (1 Thessalonians 5:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For God has not destined us for wrath, but for obtaining
salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,” (1 Thessalonians 5:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believers in the time of Paul’s writing had been
under such severe persecution that they thought they were in the Tribulation.
Paul tells them that before the Tribulation can begin, the Rapture of the
Church will take place and only then will the Man of Sin be revealed. The
church of Philadelphia was promised deliverance from the “hour of testing.” Rev.
3:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“‘Because you have kept the word of My perseverance, I also
will keep you from the hour of testing, that hour which is about to come upon
the whole world, to test those who dwell on the earth.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation
3:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is characteristic of God’s faithfulness to deliver
believers before a divine judgment is inflicted upon the world as illustrated
in the deliverance of Noah, Lot, Rahab, etc. 2 Peter 2:6-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and if He condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to
destruction by reducing them to ashes, having made them an example to those who
would live ungodly lives thereafter; and if He rescued righteous Lot, oppressed
by the sensual conduct of unprincipled men (for by what he saw and heard that
righteous man, while living among them, felt his righteous soul tormented day
after day by their lawless deeds), then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly
from temptation, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment for the day of
judgment,” (2 Peter 2:6-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the time of the Rapture of the Church, all believers
go to the Father’s house in heaven and do not immediately return to the earth
after meeting Christ in the air as the Post-Tribulationists teach. John 14:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again
and receive you to Myself, that where I am, there you may be also.” (John 14:3,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The godly remnant of the Tribulation, the “elect,” are
pictured as Israelites not members of the Church. Matt. 24:22; Matt. 24:31;
Matt 25:1-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Unless those days had been cut short, no life would have
been saved; but for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short.”
(Matthew 24:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET
and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of
the sky to the other.” (Matthew 24:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Pre-Tribulationism, as opposed to the Post-Tribulationism,
does not confuse general terms like “elect” and “saints” which apply to the
saved of all ages with specific terms like Church and those in Christ, which
refer to believers of the Church Age only. The Church is uniformly exhorted to
look for the coming of the Lord while believers in the Tribulation are directed
to look for signs. Matthew 24.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Holy Spirit is omnipresent whether the Church is
absent or present. However, when the Holy Spirit is removed as the Indweller of
the Church, the restraint of evil is removed. This is a specific type of evil
that He restrains, referring to ecumenical religion (the mystery of iniquity).
When the true Church is raptured, the false apostate church is left behind
under the Man of Sin. 2 Thess. 2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And you know what restrains him now, so that in his time he
will be revealed. For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only he
who now restrains will do so until he is taken out of the way.” (2
Thessalonians 2:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If the expression, “unless the apostasy comes first” was
translated literally, “unless the departure comes first,” it would plainly show
the necessity of the Rapture taking place before the beginning of the
Tribulation. 2 Thess. 2:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Let no one in any way deceive you, for it will not come unless
the apostasy comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of
destruction,” (2 Thessalonians 2:3, NASB)</p>
