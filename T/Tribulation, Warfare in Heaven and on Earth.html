<h2>Tribulation, Warfare in Heaven and on Earth</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Until the middle of the Tribulation, Satan will spend a
great deal of time in heaven attending angelic convocations and accusing mature
believers such as he did with Job. He will not be shut out of heaven until the
middle of the Tribulation. Once Satan and all his fallen angels are confined to
earth, Satan becomes desperate to avoid his certain judgment. He will attack
Israel with a vengeance, especially Jewish believers. Rev. 12:7-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And there was war in heaven, Michael and his angels waging war
with the dragon. The dragon and his angels waged war, and they were not strong
enough, and there was no longer a place found for them in heaven. And the great
dragon was thrown down, the serpent of old who is called the devil and Satan,
who deceives the whole world; he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels
were thrown down with him. Then I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying,
&quot;Now the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of our God and the
authority of His Christ have come, for the accuser of our brethren has been
thrown down, he who accuses them before our God day and night.” (Revelation
12:7-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Warfare will be between the elect angelic forces led by
Michael and fallen angels led by Satan. Until this time, Michael doesn’t have
permission to strike Satan. He had previously come into conflict with Satan
over the body of Moses, who will be one of the two witnesses in the Tribulation.
Jude 1:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But Michael the archangel, when he disputed with the devil and
argued about the body of Moses, did not dare pronounce against him a railing
judgment, but said, &quot;The Lord rebuke you!&quot;” (Jude 1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The result of this warfare at Mid-Tribulation will be the
removal of Satan from heaven by Michael. Satan will be cast out of heaven and
confined to the earth. All demons will be cast out of heaven by elect angels
and also confined to earth. Once Satan is cast to the earth, he will get very
tough with the human race. He will intent to seek and completely destroy the
Jews will intensify, but they will overcome him through the Blood of the Lamb.
Rev. 12:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb
and because of the word of their testimony, and they did not love their life
even when faced with death.” (Revelation 12:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan prosecutes Israel to a great extent and this
results in the middle of the Tribulation flight of the Jews to the mountains.
Probably Satan’s first act after being cast out of heaven (with God’s
permission) will be to release the invading demons from the bottomless pit. This
will be the Fifth Trumpet Judgment. Rev. 9:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star from heaven
which had fallen to the earth; and the key of the bottomless pit was given to
him.” (Revelation 9:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While Satan remains the ruler of the world as he is now, he
will be confined to the earth, his new prison. The ultimate result of Satan’s
prosecution of Israel will be in the Armageddon Campaign. Rev. 16:12-16.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river, the
Euphrates; and its water was dried up, so that the way would be prepared for
the kings from the east. And I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon and
out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three
unclean spirits like frogs; for they are spirits of demons, performing signs,
which go out to the kings of the whole world, to gather them together for the
war of the great day of God, the Almighty. (&quot;Behold, I am coming like a
thief. Blessed is the one who stays awake and keeps his clothes, so that he
will not walk about naked and men will not see his shame.&quot;) And they
gathered them together to the place which in Hebrew is called Har-Magedon.”
(Revelation 16:12-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the Second Advent of Jesus Christ at the end of the
Tribulation, Jesus Christ will utterly destroy Satan’s human armies and order
an elect angel to remove Satan from the earth and bind him for the 1,000 years
of the Millennium. As for Satan’s two dictators, the Beast and the False
Prophet, will be the first ones to be cast into the Lake of Fire for eternity. Rev.
20:1-3; Isaiah 14:12; Rev. 12:7-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding the key
of the abyss and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold of the dragon, the
serpent of old, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years;
and he threw him into the abyss, and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he
would not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were
completed; after these things he must be released for a short time.”
(Revelation 20:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;How you have fallen from heaven, O star of the
morning, son of the dawn! You have been cut down to the earth, You who have
weakened the nations!&quot;  (Isaiah 14:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And there was war in heaven, Michael and his angels
waging war with the dragon. The dragon and his angels waged war, and they were
not strong enough, and there was no longer a place found for them in heaven.
And the great dragon was thrown down, the serpent of old who is called the
devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was thrown down to the earth,
and his angels were thrown down with him.&quot;  (Revelation 12:7-9, NASB)</p>
