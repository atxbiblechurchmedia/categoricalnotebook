<h2>Time Utilization, Regret Under Extreme Circumstances</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Psalms 42-43 contain the musing of a captive of the
Assyrian captivity in 722 BC. He is sitting in a dungeon contemplating how he
got there and if he would ever get out. In Psalms 42:1-5, we have the
reflections of this prisoner of war. In the crisis, he longed for the Word of
God. Psalms 42:1. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For the choir director. A Maskil of the sons of Korah. As the
deer pants for the water brooks, So my soul pants for You, O God.” (Psalms
42:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>His first regret was that he wanted to learn more Bible
doctrine and apply it to the current situation, but he had limited Bible
doctrine in his soul. He had not made good use of his time earlier. His second
regret was whether he would ever again get to go to Bible class. He saw people
going by carrying their idols and it makes him thirst for the Lord. Psalms 42:2.
</p>

<p class=Verses>“My soul thirsts for God, for the living God; When shall I come
and appear before God?” (Psalms 42:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the crisis, he cried because of his circumstances. This
is sinful weeping, being a cry-baby. There is no residual doctrine in his soul
to sustain him. They taunted him daily asking him, “Hey, boy, where’s your
God?” He could make no impact for Christ. He had no testimony. Psalms 42:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“My tears have been my food day and night, While they say to me
all day long, &quot;Where is your God?&quot;” (Psalms 42:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the crisis, he was depressed and remembered he didn’t take
in the Word of God when he had many days to do so. He had other priorities. Psalms
42:4 </p>

<p class=Verses>“These things I remember and I pour out my soul within me. For
I used to go along with the throng and lead them in procession to the house of
God, With the voice of joy and thanksgiving, a multitude keeping festival.”
(Psalms 42:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“I pour out my soul within me” means he was in extreme
depression. He remembered long ago going to Bible class and learning the Word
of God. His third regret was not making Bible class and the daily intake and
application of Bible doctrine his highest priority in life. He had not made
good use of his time. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He was in despair and knew that God had the answers but
he couldn’t apply them. He had very little <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in
his soul to apply to the situation. He knew that only God could deliver him
from this hopeless situation. Psalms 42:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Why are you in despair, O my soul? And why have you become
disturbed within me? Hope in God, for I shall again praise Him For the help of
His presence.” (Psalms 42:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 42:6, “O my God, my soul is in despair within
me” means he was a believer and he realized that he actually brought this
situation upon himself. He didn’t stockpile the Word when he had available time
and his testing was minor compared to his current extreme situation. He then
remembered the goodness of God as a young man. What had the Lord done for him?
“The land of the Jordan” refers to a military deliverance. “The peaks of Hermon”
refers to a famous hunting area and hunting deliverance. “Mount Mizar” refers
to his deliverance from a natural disaster. </p>

<p class=Verses>“O my God, my soul is in despair within me; Therefore I
remember You from the land of the Jordan And the peaks of Hermon, from Mount
Mizar.” (Psalms 42:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 42:7, “Deep calls to deep” refers to when he
was in a narrow canyon, a flash flood was caused by a huge downpour upstream
and a wall of water hit him and he almost drowned. If God delivered him in time
past, He would do it again. Grace will find a way.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Deep calls to deep at the sound of Your waterfalls; All Your
breakers and Your waves have rolled over me.” (Psalms 42:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 42:8, he realized that he could not recall any
Bible doctrine, but he did remember a song. “God of my life” means that he
finally confessed his known sins to God the Father and got back into
fellowship. However, he didn’t stay in fellowship long and became inconsistent.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD will command His lovingkindness in the daytime; And
His song will be with me in the night, A prayer to the God of my life.” (Psalms
42:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>His inconsistency as a prisoner of war produced instability.
In Psalms 42:9, “my rock” refers to Jesus Christ as his Messiah. He was
questioning whether God was paying attention to his plight. This is
inconsistent. “I go mourning” means he was deeply depressed.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I will say to God my rock, &quot;Why have You forgotten me?
Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?&quot;” (Psalms
42:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 42:10, he was facing pressure without Bible
doctrine and without fellowship. “As a shattering of my bones” refers to the
constant pressure he was under. “My adversaries revile me” means the Assyrian
soldiers picked on him because he was a cry-baby. The Assyrians did not bother
courageous soldiers. They laugh at him and continued to ask him where was his
God. “Boy, where is your God?”</p>

<p class=Verses>“As a shattering of my bones, my adversaries revile me, While
they say to me all day long, &quot;Where is your God?&quot;” (Psalms 42:10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 42:11, he repeats his lament of soul despair. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Why are you in despair, O my soul? And why have you become
disturbed within me? Hope in God, for I shall yet praise Him, The help of my
countenance and my God.” (Psalms 42:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 43:1, “Vindicate me” means to judge, to
evaluate, to hear what he had to say. “An ungodly nation” refers to Assyria. “Deliver
me from the deceitful and unjust man!” refers to his friend who talked him out
of Bible class and could be translated, “Deliver me from that fraud, that
phony, that kept me out of Bible class.”</p>

<p class=Verses>“Vindicate me, O God, and plead my case against an ungodly
nation; O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man!” (Psalms 43:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 43:2, he continues his inconsistency. He just
can’t stay on the track. “Why have You rejected me?” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>זָנַח</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(zanach) and means he is into self-pity.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For You are the God of my strength; why have You rejected me?
Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?” (Psalms 43:2,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 43:3-4, he finally realizes that he needs to
return to learning the Word of God as a priority. “O send out Your light and
Your truth” is his prayer for God to bring Bible doctrine to him. </p>

<p class=Verses>“O send out Your light and Your truth, let them lead me; Let
them bring me to Your holy hill And to Your dwelling places. Then I will go to
the altar of God, To God my exceeding joy; And upon the lyre I shall praise
You, O God, my God.” (Psalms 43:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This was the prayer of Paul when he prayed that God would
give him the spirit of wisdom and revelation. In these verses, “knowledge”
refers to <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the soul. Eph. 1:17; Phil. 1:9; Col.
1:9-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory,
may give to you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of Him.”
(Ephesians 1:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And this I pray, that your love may abound still more and more
in real knowledge and all discernment,” (Philippians 1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason also, since the day we heard of it, we have
not ceased to pray for you and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge
of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding, so that you will walk in
a manner worthy of the Lord, to please Him in all respects, bearing fruit in
every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God;” (Colossians 1:9-10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Therefore, make good use of the time God has given you
today so you can be thankful tomorrow as well. By the way, the prisoner of war
did finally escape the Assyrians and wrote these two Psalms.</p>
