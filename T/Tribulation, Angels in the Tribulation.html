<h2>Tribulation, Angels in the Tribulation</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The “four living creatures” in Revelation 4:8-9, Revelation
6, and Revelation 15:7 will be living creatures - seraphim angels of highest
rank because of their six wings. These are the four angels that took Satan’s
place guarding the throne room of God. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And the four living creatures, each one of them having six
wings, are full of eyes around and within; and day and night they do not cease
to say, “HOLY, HOLY, HOLY is THE LORD GOD, THE ALMIGHTY, WHO WAS AND WHO IS AND
WHO IS TO COME.” And when the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks
to Him who sits on the throne, to Him who lives forever and ever,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation
4:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels
seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation
15:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are two Greek words for “living creatures” –  <span
lang=EL>ζω</span>͂<span lang=EL>ον</span> (zōon) referring to angels and <span
lang=EL>θηρι</span>́<span lang=EL>ον</span><span lang=EL> </span>(thērion) referring
to a beast or wild animal. It is used for men who act like animals. <i>Thērion</i>
is used in Revelation 13:1 referring to the Dictator of the Revived Roman
Empire and the Dictator of Palestine.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the dragon stood on the sand of the seashore. Then I saw a
beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and on his
horns were ten diadems, and on his heads were blasphemous names.” (Revelation
13:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Revelation 4:4 and Revelation 5:8, “twenty-four elders”
refers to angels of rank. “Elder” denotes rank, not age. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Around the throne were twenty-four thrones; and upon the
thrones I saw twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white garments, and golden
crowns on their heads.” (Revelation 4:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“When He had taken the book, the four living creatures and the
twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each one holding a harp and
golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.” (Revelation
5:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Revelation 7:1-2, “four angels standing at the four
corners of the earth” is an idiom that refers to the North, East, West, and South.
These are angels who are in charge of the weather.</p>

<p class=Verses>“After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of
the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth, so that no wind would blow
on the earth or on the sea or on any tree. And I saw another angel ascending
from the rising of the sun, having the seal of the living God; and he cried out
with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was granted to harm the earth
and the sea,” (Revelation 7:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Revelation 8:2, seven angels administer the seven
trumpet judgments.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven
trumpets were given to them.” (Revelation 8:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Revelation 9:14, four special fallen angels are bound
under the Euphrates River. </p>

<p class=Verses>“one saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet,
&quot;Release the four angels who are bound at the great river
Euphrates.&quot;” (Revelation 9:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Revelation 10, the angelic herald is mentioned. </p>

<p class=Verses>“I saw another strong angel coming down out of heaven, clothed
with a cloud; and the rainbow was upon his head, and his face was like the sun,
and his feet like pillars of fire; and he had in his hand a little book which
was open. He placed his right foot on the sea and his left on the land;”
(Revelation 10:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land
lifted up his right hand to heaven, and swore by Him who lives forever and
ever, WHO CREATED HEAVEN AND THE THINGS IN IT, AND THE EARTH AND THE THINGS IN
IT, AND THE SEA AND THE THINGS IN IT, that there will be delay no longer,”
(Revelation 10:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Revelation 12:7-9, the elect angels are with Michael
and the fallen angels are with Satan. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And there was war in heaven, Michael and his angels waging war
with the dragon. The dragon and his angels waged war, and they were not strong
enough, and there was no longer a place found for them in heaven. And the great
dragon was thrown down, the serpent of old who is called the devil and Satan,
who deceives the whole world; he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels
were thrown down with him.” (Revelation 12:7-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Revelation 14, the seven angels of judgment are
mentioned. In Revelation 16, seven angels administer the seven vial or bowl judgments.
An angel will be in charge of preserving the water supply. Rev. 16:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And I heard the angel of the waters saying, &quot;Righteous
are You, who are and who were, O Holy One, because You judged these things;”
(Revelation 16:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Revelation 19:17-18, an angel calls all birds to a “great
supper of God” - a judgment supper. This is not to be confused with the
marriage supper of the lamb in Revelation 19:7-8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, and he cried out with
a loud voice, saying to all the birds which fly in midheaven, &quot;Come,
assemble for the great supper of God, so that you may eat the flesh of kings
and the flesh of commanders and the flesh of mighty men and the flesh of horses
and of those who sit on them and the flesh of all men, both free men and
slaves, and small and great.&quot;” (Revelation 19:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Let us rejoice and be glad and give the glory to Him,
for the marriage of the Lamb has come and His bride has made herself
ready.&quot; It was given to her to clothe herself in fine linen, bright and
clean; for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.” (Revelation
19:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It will be an angel who will bind Satan at the end of the
Tribulation, probably Michael. Rev. 20:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding the key
of the abyss and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold of the dragon, the
serpent of old, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand
years;” (Revelation 20:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Revelation 1:1, we have an interpreting angel. </p>

<p class=Verses>“The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave Him to show to
His bond-servants, the things which must soon take place; and He sent and
communicated it by His angel to His bond-servant John,” (Revelation 1:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Revelation 2 and 3, “the angel of the church” refers
to the pastor-teachers in each of the churches mentioned. Rev. 2:1; Rev. 2:8;
Rev. 2:12; Rev. 2:18; Rev. 3:1; Rev. 3:7; Rev. 3:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;To the angel of the church in Ephesus write: The One who
holds the seven stars in His right hand, the One who walks among the seven
golden lampstands, says this:” (Revelation 2:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;To the angel of the church in Sardis write: He who has
the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars, says this: 'I know your deeds,
that you have a name that you are alive, but you are dead.” (Revelation 3:1,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Revelation 21:12, the twelve angels guard the 12 gates
of Jerusalem in Eternity. </p>

<p class=Verses>“It had a great and high wall, with twelve gates, and at the
gates twelve angels; and names were written on them, which are the names of the
twelve tribes of the sons of Israel.” (Revelation 21:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Seven Angels of Judgment</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Elect angels will administer a lot of judgment on behalf of
the Lord Jesus Christ. Probably these angels will take on human form. They will
evangelize in two ways - love and fear.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first angel in Revelation 14:6-7 gives warning. His
job will be to present the principle of grace before judgment.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And I saw another angel flying in midheaven, having an eternal
gospel to preach to those who live on the earth, and to every nation and tribe
and tongue and people; and he said with a loud voice, &quot;Fear God, and give
Him glory, because the hour of His judgment has come; worship Him who made the
heaven and the earth and sea and springs of waters.&quot;” (Revelation 14:6-7,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The second angel in Revelation 14:8 will have the
responsibility to administer judgment to religion. Religion is the satanic
counterfeit of true relationship with God. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And another angel, a second one, followed, saying,
&quot;Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, she who has made all the nations
drink of the wine of the passion of her immorality.&quot;” (Revelation 14:8,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The third angel in Revelation 14:9-13 will judge those
who adhere to religion. Both the system and those who are a part of the system will
be judged. In the 10-nation confederation, there will be the union of church
and state. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then another angel, a third one, followed them, saying with a
loud voice, &quot;If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives a
mark on his forehead or on his hand, he also will drink of the wine of the
wrath of God, which is mixed in full strength in the cup of His anger; and he
will be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels
and in the presence of the Lamb. &quot;And the smoke of their torment goes up
forever and ever; they have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast
and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.&quot; Here is the
perseverance of the saints who keep the commandments of God and their faith in
Jesus. And I heard a voice from heaven, saying, &quot;Write, 'Blessed are the
dead who die in the Lord from now on!'&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; says the Spirit,
&quot;so that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow with
them.&quot;” (Revelation 14:9-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fourth angel in Revelation 14:14-16 will administer military
judgment. This will be the prologue of the Armageddon Campaign. Judgments will involve
the slaughter of armies which will be authorized by Jesus Christ, who will be
seated with a sharp sickle in His hand. The reasons for this judgment will be rejection
of Jesus Christ and anti-Semitism. Details can be found in Revelation 19:15-21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and sitting on the
cloud was one like a son of man, having a golden crown on His head and a sharp
sickle in His hand. And another angel came out of the temple, crying out with a
loud voice to Him who sat on the cloud, &quot;Put in your sickle and reap, for
the hour to reap has come, because the harvest of the earth is ripe.&quot; Then
He who sat on the cloud swung His sickle over the earth, and the earth was
reaped.” (Revelation 14:14-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fifth angel in Revelation 14:17 will also administer
military judgment. This angel will be responsible for killing off part of the
armies in the Armageddon Campaign. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven,
and he also had a sharp sickle.” (Revelation 14:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The sixth angel in Revelation 14:18 will also administer
military judgment, but toward military unbelievers. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then another angel, the one who has power over fire, came out
from the altar; and he called with a loud voice to him who had the sharp
sickle, saying, &quot;Put in your sharp sickle and gather the clusters from the
vine of the earth, because her grapes are ripe.&quot;” (Revelation 14:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The seventh angel in Revelation 14:19-20 administers
judgment to “the clusters from the vine” those who will be overdue for judgment.
</p>

<p class=Verses>“So the angel swung his sickle to the earth and gathered the
clusters from the vine of the earth, and threw them into the great wine press
of the wrath of God. And the wine press was trodden outside the city, and blood
came out from the wine press, up to the horses' bridles, for a distance of two
hundred miles.” (Revelation 14:19-20, NASB)</p>
