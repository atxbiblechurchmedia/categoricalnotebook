<h2>Tribulation, Why The Church Does Not Go Through the Tribulation</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Church and Israel are two separate entities
representing Jesus Christ. The Tribulation will be the last remaining seven
years of the Jewish Age (the Age of Israel) and therefore, the Church will not be
present. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/D/Daniel%E2%80%99s%2070th%20Week%20%E2%80%93%20The%20Tribulation.html">Daniel’s 70th Week -
The Tribulation</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The 144,000 evangelists in the Tribulation will all be
Jews. During this last remaining seven years of the Age of Israel, they will be
administrators responsible for the dissemination of the Gospel. Rev. 7:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And I heard the number of those who were sealed, one hundred
and forty-four thousand sealed from every tribe of the sons of Israel:”
(Revelation 7:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Revelation 2 and 3 depict the conditions of the Church
Age starting on the Day of Pentecost and ending with the Rapture of the Church.
In Revelation 2 and 3 in the messages to the churches, there is a phrase that
is repeated seven times - “He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says
to the churches.” Rev. 2:7; Rev. 2:11; Rev. 2:17; Rev. 2:29; Rev. 3:6; Rev.
3:13; Rev. 3:22. </p>

<p class=Verses>“'He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the
churches. To him who overcomes, I will grant to eat of the tree of life which
is in the Paradise of God.'” (Revelation 2:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“'He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the
churches.'” (Revelation 2:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i><span style='color:blue'>“'He who has an ear, let him
hear what the Spirit says to the churches.'&quot;” (Revelation 3:22, NASB)</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The next time it occurs is in Revelation 13:9, but here the
phrase is cut off after “hear” indicating that it is no longer addressed to the
churches. This means that the Church has been removed from the earth at the
Rapture before the Tribulation begins. Rev. 7-19. </p>

<p class=Verses>“If anyone has an ear, let him hear.” (Revelation 13:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Revelation 4:1, “these things” refers to the Church
Age and “after these things” refers to the Tribulation.</p>

<p class=Verses>“After these things I looked, and behold, a door standing open
in heaven, and the first voice which I had heard, like the sound of a trumpet
speaking with me, said, &quot;Come up here, and I will show you what must take
place after these things.&quot;” (Revelation 4:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Revelation 4:6, the Church is pictured in heaven as a
“sea of glass” and means the “sea” of people in the Church are at rest. The “sea”
must be interpreted in context. At other times as in Revelation 15:2, “sea” has
a completely different connotation. </p>

<p class=Verses>“and before the throne there was something like a sea of glass,
like crystal; and in the center and around the throne, four living creatures
full of eyes in front and behind.” (Revelation 4:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire, and
those who had been victorious over the beast and his image and the number of
his name, standing on the sea of glass, holding harps of God.” (Revelation
15:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Law of Double Jeopardy means that one cannot be
judged twice for the same infraction. By application, our sins cannot be judged
twice. We know that Jesus Christ was judged for the sins of all mankind on the Cross.
We also know that all Church Age believers make up the Body of Christ because
they are all in permanent union with Jesus Christ (Baptism of the Holy Spirit).
Therefore, when Jesus Christ breaks the seals of judgment in Revelation 6, He would
be bringing judgment upon Himself if the Church were present on earth. In a
related application of this principle, when Paul (then called Saul) was
persecuting the Church, Jesus Christ said that Paul was persecuting Him in Acts
9:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him,
&quot;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?&quot;” (Acts 9:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The reason for the Third Vial Judgment in Revelation 16:6
is that they have shed the blood of “saints and prophets.” This is Jewish Age terminology,
not “saints and preachers” (a Church Age term). </p>

<p class=Verses>“for they poured out the blood of saints and prophets, and You
have given them blood to drink. They deserve it.&quot;” (Revelation 16:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All Church Age believers will have departed planet earth at
the Rapture. The Tribulation starts with unbelievers only. In Revelation 13:6,
“those who dwell in heaven” refers to Church Age believers already raptured. In
this verse, the First Beast is trying to explain away the Rapture. 1 Thess.
4:14-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God
will bring with Him those who have fallen asleep in Jesus. For this we say to
you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming
of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep. For the Lord
Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel
and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we
who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to
meet the Lord in the air, and so we shall always be with the Lord.” (1
Thessalonians 4:14-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And he opened his mouth in blasphemies against God, to
blaspheme His name and His tabernacle, that is, those who dwell in heaven.”
(Revelation 13:6, NASB)</p>
