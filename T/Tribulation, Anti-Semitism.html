<h2>Tribulation, Anti-Semitism</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Tribulation will be the greatest period of
anti-Semitism the world has ever known. Rev. 12. Anti-Semitism is Satanic in
nature. A warning against anti-Semitism is given in Genesis 12:1-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now the LORD said to Abram, &quot;Go forth from your
country, And from your relatives And from your father's house, To the land
which I will show you; And I will make you a great nation, And I will bless
you, And make your name great; And so you shall be a blessing; And I will bless
those who bless you, And the one who curses you I will curse. And in you all
the families of the earth will be blessed.&quot;&quot;  (Genesis 12:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Anti-Semitism before the Cross involved the lineage of
the true humanity of Jesus Christ. The line of Messiah was Jewish and Jews have
always been under attack. For example, Mary was a descendant of the family of
David who was in the tribe of Judah. Anti-Semitism before the Cross attempted
to destroy Jesus Christ at birth and up to the Cross. Anti-Semitism before the
Cross opposed Israel as a race and was directed, as always, by Satan.
Anti-Semitism after the Cross also seeks to destroy all Jews so that God’s four
unconditional covenants to Israel cannot be fulfilled at the Second Advent. Rev.
12:3-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then another sign appeared in heaven: and behold, a great
red dragon having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads were seven
diadems. And his tail swept away a third of the stars of heaven and threw them
to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give
birth, so that when she gave birth he might devour her child.&quot; 
(Revelation 12:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Anti-Semitism comes from some strange sources. There is a
breed of conservative that is anti-Jew. He blames all the world’s troubles on a
Jewish conspiracy. Conspiracies do exist, but they always involve more than the
Jews. Anti-Jew thinking can bring discipline on your church. Avoid this mental
attitude sin like the plague.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In spite of Satanic attempts, Israel will continue to
exist in the world. Israel existed in the Land and still exists out of the Land
currently still under the Fifth Cycle of Discipline or the Diaspora. In the
middle of the Tribulation, Satan and all fallen angels will be cast out of
heaven and confined to the earth. This will be Satan’s second fall. He will
increase his persecution of Israel using military strength causing Jewish
believers to flee to the mountains. Rev. 12:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And the serpent poured water like a river out of his
mouth after the woman, so that he might cause her to be swept away with the
flood.&quot;  (Revelation 12:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s protection for Israel in the Tribulation will be in
the form of disturbances on earth, which prevent the armies from following the
fleeing regenerate Israel. Probably the 4th and 6th Vial judgments. Satan’s
hatred for Israel is the background for the Armageddon Campaign. Rev. 12:17.
See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/A/Anti-Semitism.html">Anti-Semitism</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So the dragon was enraged with the woman, and went off to
make war with the rest of her children, who keep the commandments of God and
hold to the testimony of Jesus.&quot;  (Revelation 12:17, NASB)</p>
