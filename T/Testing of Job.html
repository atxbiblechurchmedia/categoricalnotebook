<h2><a name="_Testing_of_Job"></a>Testing of Job</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers must receive Jesus Christ as their Savior and
then they must grow spiritually. In growing spiritually to maturity, the
believer must be tested many times. Most people today grow from physical
babyhood to maturity at about 20 years of age. A certain amount of testing is
allotted to them which is common to man. Job 1:1; 1 Cor. 10:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and that
man was blameless, upright, fearing God and turning away from evil.” (Job 1:1,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“No temptation has overtaken you but such as is common to man;
and God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are
able, but with the temptation will provide the way of escape also, so that you
will be able to endure it.” (1 Corinthians 10:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The only way of escape or handling the testing is through
application of Bible doctrine while filled with God the Holy Spirit. The length
of the testing is more severe than the intensity of testing. Job was able to
take robbery, arson, economic collapse, loss of children, health and rapport
with the wife, but the test of his interpersonal relationships with other men
was the most difficult. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Men tend to be aggressive. They initiate and tend to be dogmatic
and dislike being under another’s authority. They don’t like to be bulldogged,
coerced, or embarrassed. Once crossed, they never forget. For a man to be grace
oriented is all about the <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in their soul. He
does not lose his manhood or headship the Bible doctrine way. Therefore, men
will tend to be inflexible and condemnatory. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When Job became depressed from the intensity of his
testing, he was disoriented to the plan of God. Job 3:1-12. He became desirous
for oblivion. Job 3:13-19. He became fearful. Job 3:20-25. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Afterward Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his
birth. And Job said, &quot;Let the day perish on which I was to be born, And
the night which said, 'A boy is conceived.'” (Job 3:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Why did I not die at birth, Come forth from the womb and
expire?” (Job 3:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For now I would have lain down and been quiet; I would
have slept then, I would have been at rest,” (Job 3:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Or like a miscarriage which is discarded, I would not
be, As infants that never saw light. &quot;There the wicked cease from raging,
And there the weary are at rest.” (Job 3:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Why is light given to him who suffers, And life to the
bitter of soul, Who long for death, but there is none, And dig for it more than
for hidden treasures,” (Job 3:20-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden, And
whom God has hedged in? &quot;For my groaning comes at the sight of my food,
And my cries pour out like water. &quot;For what I fear comes upon me, And what
I dread befalls me.” (Job 3:23-25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Eliphaz when conversing, misapplied Bible doctrine and
assumed to have the answers. He considered Job to be a know-it-all. He was
chastisement conscious, rather than Christ-conscious. Job 4:17; Job 4; Job 5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;According to what I have seen, those who plow iniquity
And those who sow trouble harvest it. &quot;By the breath of God they perish,
And by the blast of His anger they come to an end.” (Job 4:8-9, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“'Can mankind be just before God? Can a man be pure before his
Maker?” (Job 4:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For affliction does not come from the dust, Nor does
trouble sprout from the ground, For man is born for trouble, As sparks fly
upward. &quot;But as for me, I would seek God, And I would place my cause
before God;” (Job 5:6-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Behold, how happy is the man whom God reproves, So do
not despise the discipline of the Almighty. &quot;For He inflicts pain, and
gives relief; He wounds, and His hands also heal.” (Job 5:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Bildad when conversing, had faulty observation. He also
had a faulty conclusion and was a hypocrite by claiming to be spiritually mature
when he wasn’t. Job 8:2; Job 8:13. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;How long will you say these things, And the words of
your mouth be a mighty wind?” (Job 8:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;So are the paths of all who forget God; And the hope of
the godless will perish,” (Job 8:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Zophar when conversing, spoke for God and was
presumptuous. He was sin-centered. He felt that Job needed to confess his sins
to God.  Job 11:5-6; Job 11:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But would that God might speak, And open His lips
against you, And show you the secrets of wisdom! For sound wisdom has two
sides. Know then that God forgets a part of your iniquity.” (Job 11:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“If iniquity is in your hand, put it far away, And do not let
wickedness dwell in your tents;” (Job 11:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The answer is to get Bible doctrine under the proper
God-ordained plan and specifically understand the Angelic Conflict. Job 40:6-7.

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD answered Job out of the storm and said,
&quot;Now gird up your loins like a man; I will ask you, and you instruct Me.”
(Job 40:6-7, NASB)</p>
