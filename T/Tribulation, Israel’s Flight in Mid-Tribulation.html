<h2>Tribulation, Israel’s Flight in Mid-Tribulation</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the mid-point of the Tribulation, a statue of the Dictator
of the Revived Roman Empire (the Beast), also known as the Abomination of
Desolation spoken of in Daniel, will be set up in the temple in Jerusalem. The normal
temple worship will be discontinued and mandatory worship of this image will be
started. Believers in Jerusalem will have to flee to the mountains of Edom,
Moab and Ammon for safety when they hear of the animation of the statue of the
Beast – the Abomination of Desolation. Matt. 24:15; Rev. 12:6; Daniel 9:27. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Therefore when you see the ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION
which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let
the reader understand),” (Matthew 24:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the woman fled into the wilderness where she had a place
prepared by God, so that there she would be nourished for one thousand two
hundred and sixty days.” (Revelation 12:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;And he will make a firm covenant with the many for one
week, but in the middle of the week he will put a stop to sacrifice and grain
offering; and on the wing of abominations will come one who makes desolate,
even until a complete destruction, one that is decreed, is poured out on the
one who makes desolate.&quot;” (Daniel 9:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 24:13, “endures” means to stay alive and “to
the end” refers to the end of the Tribulation. “Will be saved” refers to being
delivered physically by the Second Advent of Jesus Christ. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But the one who endures to the end, he will be saved.”
(Matthew 24:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 24:14, “This gospel of the kingdom” is the same
Gospel that we have in the Church Age. “Shall be preached in the whole world”
refers to Gentiles. Evangelism will be world-wide. “The end will come” refers
to the end of grace in the Tribulation and the start of judgment at the Second
Advent. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the
whole world as a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.”
(Matthew 24:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 24:15,  “when you see” refers to believing
Jews in Judea at the mid-point of the Tribulation. The “Abomination of Desolation”
will be the animated statue of the Dictator of the Revived Roman Empire. “Holy
place” refers to the Holy of Holies in the Jewish temple in Jerusalem. This is
part of the alliance between the Dictator of the Revived Roman Empire and the
Jewish Dictator. This is the signal for them to flee to the mountains.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Therefore when you see the ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION
which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let
the reader understand),” (Matthew 24:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Let the reader understand” is a warning to Jewish
believers living near the mid-point of the Tribulation. You cannot apply what
you do not know. Those who fail to learn Bible doctrine and to gain enough
spiritual discernment to run for their lives or choose to stay behind will be
killed. See category on the <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/A/Abomination%20of%20Desolation.html">Abomination of
Desolation</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 24:16, “then” will be the signal to run for
their lives and “flee into the mountains” refers to mountains of Edom, Moab,
and Ammon. </p>

<p class=Verses>“then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains.”
(Matthew 24:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 24:17-19, “housetop” refers to gardens which
will be on rooftops then. Since Israel was an agricultural economy when this
was written, today it would refer to shops where people work, the office, or at
home, etc. When they first hear of the animation of the statue in the temple,
they will have to drop everything and run for their lives to the mountains. For
some, like sick or pregnant women, it will be harder to travel and they may not
make it to safety in time. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Whoever is on the housetop must not go down to get the
things out that are in his house. &quot;Whoever is in the field must not turn
back to get his cloak. &quot;But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who
are nursing babies in those days!” (Matthew 24:17-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 24:20-22, “winter, or on a Sabbath” means that
it will be more difficult to survive and to get into the hill country in winter
likely due to road conditions or heavy traffic on the roads that will delay
them. “Great tribulation” refers to the last half of the Tribulation. In Matthew
24:22, “for the sake of the elect” refers to Jewish believers. Once Satan is
cast out of heaven so he cannot return, so he is going to take out all his
wrath on the Jews. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But pray that your flight will not be in the winter, or
on a Sabbath. &quot;For then there will be a great tribulation, such as has not
occurred since the beginning of the world until now, nor ever will.
&quot;Unless those days had been cut short, no life would have been saved; but
for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short.” (Matthew 24:20-22,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 24:23-26, the police and military followers of
the Dictator of the Revived Roman Empire and the False Prophet will try to
deceive the believers in the mountains, no doubt using sound trucks and on-line
electronic communication via wireless and internet etc., saying, “here is the Christ”
or “There He is,” etc. ...” Those that believe the propaganda instead of what
the Bible says will come out and be killed. “Great signs and wonders” refers to
Satanic tongues, healing, etc. “Even the elect” refers to the believers up in
the mountains who need spiritual discernment.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Then if anyone says to you, 'Behold, here is the
Christ,' or 'There He is,' do not believe him. &quot;For false Christs and
false prophets will arise and will show great signs and wonders, so as to
mislead, if possible, even the elect. &quot;Behold, I have told you in advance.
&quot;So if they say to you, 'Behold, He is in the wilderness,' do not go out,
or, 'Behold, He is in the inner rooms,' do not believe them.” (Matthew
24:23-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Jewish believers with Bible doctrine will be
delivered at the Second Advent of Jesus Christ. Every eye on earth will see
Him. Rev. 1:7; Rev. 19:11-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“BEHOLD, HE IS COMING WITH THE CLOUDS, and every eye will see
Him, even those who pierced Him; and all the tribes of the earth will mourn
over Him. So it is to be. Amen.” (Revelation 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and He who
sat on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and wages
war. His eyes are a flame of fire, and on His head are many diadems; and He has
a name written on Him which no one knows except Himself. He is clothed with a
robe dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God.” (Revelation
19:11-13, NASB)</p>
