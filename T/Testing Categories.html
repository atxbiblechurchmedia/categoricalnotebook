<h2>Testing Categories</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Testing in the spiritual life was designed by God to
provide the environment for application of Bible doctrine and in so doing to
use God's grace resources to handle the test while remaining in fellowship.
Accomplishing this means using only God's resources, not your own abilities.
It’s all about application of God's promises (Bible doctrine) while filled and
empowered by God the Holy Spirit. No believer reaches spiritual maturity apart
from testing.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual growth results from perception of Bible
doctrine, but spiritual growth is accelerated from the application of Bible
doctrine while under testing. Some of the testing in the spiritual life results
in undeserved suffering, but all categories of testing in the spiritual life
are designed by God for blessing whether the conditions are adversity or
prosperity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You must apply different doctrines to different
situations. You also must discern from that <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine
when is the right time and situation to apply some doctrines. The believer’s
volition determines the outcome of the testing - passing the test or failing
the test. The believer must make the right decision based on their application
of Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Thought Testing</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Thought testing occurs at all stages of spiritual growth,
but as with all testing, the level of testing is always commensurate with the
level of spiritual growth. 2 Cor. 12:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore I am well content with weaknesses, with insults,
with distresses, with persecutions, with difficulties, for Christ's sake; for
when I am weak, then I am strong.” (2 Corinthians 12:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For the believer to pass thought testing, they must be
filled with the Holy Spirit, have the discernment to apply the correct Bible
doctrine from the right lobe of their soul to the situation and not to be
distracted or misled by false issues or wrong priorities. Through spiritual
growth, the believer’s thinking is renewed from the inside out. You can never
know the will of God for your life is without renewed thinking. Rom. 12:2. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by
the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that
which is good and acceptable and perfect.” (Romans 12:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer’s mental attitude is important in handling
thought testing. Everyone has questions about a great many things and our
thinking is constantly changing. This can make you unstable if you don’t have
Bible doctrine in your soul to stabilize your thinking and provide the basis
for sound judgment. Rom. 12:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For through the grace given to me I say to everyone among you
not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think; but to think so as
to have sound judgment, as God has allotted to each a measure of faith.”
(Romans 12:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Word of God says that you really are what you think,
not what you do and not necessarily what you say. The real you is what you
think in your soul. People are not always what they appear to be on the surface
because they have become adept at hiding their thoughts. They put up an outward
façade that projects an entirely different person and thought pattern when
compared to what they are really thinking. Prov. 23:7. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For as he thinks within himself, so he is. He says to you,
&quot;Eat and drink!&quot; But his heart is not with you.” (Proverbs 23:7,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Your mental attitude and thinking process in your own
soul must be your own. You can’t borrow the thoughts of others. You must do
your own thinking. You must make your own decisions and handle your own
problems.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer’s ability to gain the capacity to cope with and
appreciate life and to gain an inner happiness in life is based on what they
think. We are to live every day of our life as unto the Lord. This can only be
done based on our thinking each and every day. Rom. 14:6. </p>

<p class=Verses>“He who observes the day, observes it for the Lord, and he who
eats, does so for the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he who eats not,
for the Lord he does not eat, and gives thanks to God.” (Romans 14:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Passing thought testing depends on the believer’s
application of the Bible doctrine in their soul. This includes recalling some
of God's promises and applying them to the situation. This can only be done
while filled with the Holy Spirit. Isaiah 55:6-9.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“Seek the LORD while He may be found; Call upon Him while He is
near. Let the wicked forsake his way And the unrighteous man his thoughts; And
let him return to the LORD, And He will have compassion on him, And to our God,
For He will abundantly pardon. &quot;For My thoughts are not your thoughts, Nor
are your ways My ways,&quot; declares the LORD. &quot;For as the heavens are
higher than the earth, So are My ways higher than your ways And My thoughts
than your thoughts.” (Isaiah 55:6-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Failure in thought testing usually involves some type of
human viewpoint thinking that focuses on false solutions to the problems or
decisions at hand. Human beings have a fantastic ability to rationalize. Rationalization
is a false system for problem solving that includes self-justification of your
thoughts, words, and actions or refusing to take the responsibility for your
own bad decisions. You blame others for your failures and reasons for your
suffering.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Rationalization also includes becoming angry at a
solution to the problem or situation and even refusing to accept that the
problem exists. This can be a defense mechanism to protect the mind against
pressures too great to bear. Rationalization includes ignoring the problem in
hopes that it will go away on its own. This is pure human viewpoint thinking
and has never solved any problem. Rationalization includes avoiding the problem
by focusing your attention on something new such as a new hobby, new type of entertainment,
traveling to new places, etc. This is the believer with no capacity for life,
love, or happiness. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Bible doctrine is the only true solution to problems and
making good decisions because they are based on God's solutions with His
thinking and empowered by God the Holy Spirit. 2 Cor. 10:4-6. </p>

<p class=Verses>“for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but
divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses. We are destroying
speculations and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God, and
we are taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ, and we are
ready to punish all disobedience, whenever your obedience is complete.” (2
Corinthians 10:4-6, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>System Testing</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>System testing comes from an organization that collectively
operates to accomplish certain specific objectives determined by their
leadership. Testing for the believer can come from the system or organization’s
authority, their policies, or their objectives.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>System testing can come from all types of organizations
such as businesses, professional organizations such as medical groups and law
offices, local churches and missionary organizations, government organizations,
athletic organizations in school or in professional sports, military service
organizations, and from the divine institutions of marriage, family, and nationalism.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are good and bad organizations, systems,
leadership, policies, and objectives.  Your system testing may be from either
category, good or bad. Everyone has an old sin nature, so system testing will
always occur. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>System testing can involve unfair and unjust treatment
from many different sources such as the management of the company you work for,
your supervisor or boss, your coach, your teachers in school, government
bureaucrats whether local, state or national, your spouse, and your parents.
System testing can involve unfair or unreasonable policies from organizations
that conflict with what you consider normal living or with your norms and
standards. System testing can involve organizational objectives that seem unreasonable
or even impossible to achieve. Prov. 24:10; Col. 3:17; Col. 3:18-21; Col. 4:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If you are slack in the day of distress, Your strength is
limited.” (Proverbs 24:10, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“Whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the
Lord Jesus, giving thanks through Him to God the Father.” (Colossians 3:17,
NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.
Husbands, love your wives and do not be embittered against them. Children, be
obedient to your parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing to the Lord.
Fathers, do not exasperate your children, so that they will not lose heart.”
(Colossians 3:18-21, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“Whatever you do, do your work heartily, as for the Lord rather
than for men,” (Colossians 3:23, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“Masters, grant to your slaves justice and fairness, knowing
that you too have a Master in heaven.” (Colossians 4:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>People Testing</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>People testing can come from those you love or admire and
it can come from those that you dislike or even hate. When you fall in love,
that person may gain control of your life in such a way that you become
unhappy. Some try to please the object of their love and find themselves
becoming a different person and not necessarily in a good way. As for people
you dislike, they too may gain control of your life, unless you have advanced in
the spiritual life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For those you like or dislike, if you have Bible doctrine
in your soul and have grown spiritually, it will be much more difficult for
them to make you unhappy and get you out of fellowship due to your mental
attitude of unconditional <i>agapao</i> love. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s plan was designed so that your happiness will
always reside within you in the spiritual life and that you need not depend on other
people or things to gain true inner peace or happiness. In your spiritual life,
the believer gains personal control over their life based on the renewing of
their thinking from <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine resident in the right lobe
of the soul. From that divine viewpoint thinking, you bring your happiness and
confidence in God's plan to others. You no longer lean on people or
circumstances to make you happy. Rom. 12:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by
the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that
which is good and acceptable and perfect.” (Romans 12:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>People are easily persuaded by others to stray from the plan
of God and Bible doctrine. These may be your friends, members of your family, colleagues
at work, or those in organizations you may belong to. Unless you have grown
spiritually and have some Bible doctrine in your soul, you may inadvertently
allow those you fall in love with or new friends to gain control your life and your
inner happiness.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When you make a new friend or fall in love and some event
causes you to become jealous, possessive, or to hate someone who has gained
power over you, you have become a slave to them. You now have a big problem and
the problem is you, not them. You have allowed them to cause you to sin and
therefore be out of fellowship. Your spiritual life is in neutral and may even
be going in reverse. You are in a state of self-induced misery along with God's
administration of divine discipline.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The solution to people testing is always first to name
your known sins to God the Father and regain the filling of the Holy Spirit per
1 John 1:9. After that, you should recall some of God's promises and apply them
to the situation. Then, from the Bible doctrine in your soul and motivated by
your love for God the Father, you can exercise unconditional love toward those
who make you unhappy or antagonize you. This can only be accomplished by the
filling of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Disaster Testing</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every believer will endure disasters of one kind or
another during their lives. God allows disasters to enter your life for
testing. How the believer handles these disasters determines whether their
spiritual growth will accelerate, slow down, or even reverse. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Disaster testing is designed as suffering for blessing
for accelerated spiritual growth for the believer positive to Bible doctrine
and who relies on God's grace resources and the Bible doctrine in their souls
to carry them through the disaster. In contrast, disaster testing for the
negative believer serves as divine discipline meant to wake them up to their
need to return to fellowship with God and to then learn God's plan for their
lives. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The characteristics of personal disaster testing include
physical pain or mental pain and anguish, being the victim of crime, being
persecuted, enduring harsh conditions such as hunger, thirst, exposure, and
fatigue, the loss of those you love, loss of your property, losing a successful
position or accomplishment, losing monetary wealth and money, and enduring
illness and physical and mental handicaps.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>National disaster testing involves the consequences of
bad decisions made by leadership in the region, the state, and the nation. For
example, a great deal of undeserved suffering can occur when the leadership of
a country decides to go to war with another nation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The characteristics of national disaster include enduring
uncontrolled violence and crime, acts of terrorism within the nation, uncontrolled
use of drugs, breakdown of the objectivity of the judicial system, breakdown of
enforcement of laws, warfare within the nation, weather disasters, breakdown of
the adherence to the Laws of Divine Establishment, and the five cycles of
national divine discipline administered by God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Prosperity Testing</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Prosperity is the easily most subtle distraction to
continued spiritual growth. Prosperity testing challenges the top priority of
the daily intake and application of Bible doctrine. Will you keep Bible
doctrine your number one priority or not? Every believer must pass the
prosperity test before they can reach spiritual maturity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Passing this test confirms the believer’s scale of values
and proves that they are in line with God's plan for their life as revealed in
the Word of God. Passing this test results in a more stabilized spiritual life
and a greater capacity for love and for life. Passing this test means that the
believer receives God’s greatest prosperity - His blessings conveyed in time
and in eternity. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The world offers opportunity for many types of prosperity
such as success, wealth, fame, promotion, social and professional prosperity. But
without maintaining Bible doctrine and function in the spiritual life as your
priority, such prosperity will bring only self-induced misery and divine
discipline. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When you have the same inner happiness in adversity as
well as prosperity, it means you have passed the test. If you are unhappy in
the midst of prosperity, it means that you have failed the test.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><a name="_D-Testing,_Mental_Attitude"></a><a
name="_D-Prosperity_Testing"></a>There are many aspects of prosperity and with
each comes testing in the spiritual life. Material, social, physical, and
family prosperity are all based on your mental attitude. The relaxed mental
attitude determines the believer’s spiritual condition as they grow spiritually
from being a spiritual babe to a spiritual adult. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Material Prosperity </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 6:25-33 and Proverbs 3:9-10 are God's
blessings of material prosperity for the spiritually growing believer.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For this reason I say to you, do not be worried about
your life, as to what you will eat or what you will drink; nor for your body,
as to what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than
clothing?” (Matthew 6:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For the Gentiles eagerly seek all these things; for your
heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. &quot;But seek first His
kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.”
(Matthew 6:32-33, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Honor the LORD from your wealth And from the first of all your
produce; So your barns will be filled with plenty And your vats will overflow
with new wine.” (Proverbs 3:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 1:19, some pursue material prosperity by
violent means. Material prosperity accelerates the need for a relaxed mental
attitude. </p>

<p class=Verses>“So are the ways of everyone who gains by violence; It takes
away the life of its possessors.” (Proverbs 1:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Social Prosperity </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Social prosperity is another aspect of God's blessings in
life. An example of handling well His social prosperity was in our Lord’s early
years of growing up in Luke 2:40 and Luke 2:52. Another example was David who
even had his enemies at peace with him. </p>

<p class=Verses>“The Child continued to grow and become strong, increasing in
wisdom; and the grace of God was upon Him.” (Luke 2:40, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And Jesus kept increasing in wisdom and stature, and in favor
with God and men.” (Luke 2:52, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Gedaliah really enjoyed his social prosperity, but he
couldn’t stand the high office. He enjoyed having the “beautiful people” in.
When you enjoy your many new “friends” in academic circles, athletic circles,
etc. make sure you do not get fatheaded. Jer. 40:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then all the Jews returned from all the places to which they
had been driven away and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah, and
gathered in wine and summer fruit in great abundance.” (Jeremiah 40:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You may have many “friends” because you have some money.
You may have friends because you are smart, popular, and desirable to be
around. You may get a scholarship or two or an award for something you have
accomplished. People tell you that you are really something and you become
stupid enough to believe it all. Prov. 19:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Wealth adds many friends, But a poor man is separated from his
friend.” (Proverbs 19:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Physical Prosperity </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 3 John 1:2, we are to pray for physical prosperity or
good health as we grow spiritually.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“Beloved, I pray that in all respects you may prosper and be in
good health, just as your soul prospers.” (3 John 1:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Proverbs 3:7-8 tells us to keep our focus on the Lord and
our spiritual life and it will benefit our health.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do not be wise in your own eyes; Fear the LORD and turn away
from evil. It will be healing to your body And refreshment to your bones.”
(Proverbs 3:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 Timothy 4:8 tells us that keeping our bodies in good
shape is a benefit, but keeping our soul in good shape is far better with
eternal implications.</p>

<p class=Verses>“for bodily discipline is only of little profit, but godliness
is profitable for all things, since it holds promise for the present life and
also for the life to come.” (1 Timothy 4:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Family Prosperity</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Family prosperity resulting from childhood respect for
their parents provides a longer life. Exodus 20:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be
prolonged in the land which the LORD your God gives you.” (Exodus 20:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Watch out for prosperity of the wicked. It will not last.
Psalms 73:3-7, Psalms 73:17-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For I was envious of the arrogant As I saw the prosperity of
the wicked. For there are no pains in their death, And their body is fat. They
are not in trouble as other men, Nor are they plagued like mankind. Therefore
pride is their necklace; The garment of violence covers them. Their eye bulges
from fatness; The imaginations of their heart run riot.” (Psalms 73:3-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Until I came into the sanctuary of God; Then I perceived their
end. Surely You set them in slippery places; You cast them down to
destruction.” (Psalms 73:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Doctrinal Prosperity </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Doctrinal prosperity or spiritual growth is a prelude to
other aspects of prosperity and requires a strong doctrinal mental attitude. See
the illustration of Gedaliah below. Matt 6:33; Mark 8:34-38; 2 Cor 4:16. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and
all these things will be added to you.” (Matthew 6:33, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He summoned the crowd with His disciples, and said to
them, &quot;If anyone wishes to come after Me, he must deny himself, and take
up his cross and follow Me. &quot;For whoever wishes to save his life will lose
it, but whoever loses his life for My sake and the gospel's will save it.
&quot;For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world, and forfeit his
soul? &quot;For what will a man give in exchange for his soul? &quot;For
whoever is ashamed of Me and My words in this adulterous and sinful generation,
the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when He comes in the glory of His
Father with the holy angels.&quot;” (Mark 8:34-38, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore we do not lose heart, but though our outer man is
decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day.” (2 Corinthians 4:16,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Doctrinal prosperity may require a crash program of
learning Bible doctrine to grow in grace and knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ
as soon as possible. Spiritual growth results in the accumulation of <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the soul whereby your edification complex
of the soul is constructed. Eph. 4:11-12; Eph. 4:14-15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some
as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the
saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ;”
(Ephesians 4:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and
there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of
men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming; but speaking the truth in love, we
are to grow up in all aspects into Him who is the head, even Christ,”
(Ephesians 4:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every advance in Bible doctrine brings an increased
number of spiritual blind spots. A spiritual blind spot is assuming mistakenly
(not enough Bible doctrine yet) that sweetness is spirituality and bluntness is
carnality and thus we get naive, lazy, and let our guard down. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The challenge for the believer is how to handle tough
situations. What about that obnoxious person who crosses you? What about that
trying circumstance or that something that bugs you? What about all that
pressure and frustration that upsets your plans? God will test you, prove you, and
develop you. Isn’t God’s plan greater than an obnoxious person? Isn’t God’s
plan greater than a trying circumstance?</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Gedaliah’s Failed Prosperity Test</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Jeremiah 40-41, Gedaliah had a happiness interlude of
60 days with no trials or troubles. Having everyone behaving nice can wipe you
out! Gedaliah was a man in whom there was no guile (like Nathaniel). His
honesty and forthrightness in responding to Jeremiah’s ministry revealed
something of his character. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Gedaliah made the mistake of assuming that everyone was
like him and was open and aboveboard. People often make this mistake. People
are different in disposition, in energy, in tactfulness, in fairness, in soul
kinks, in hang-ups, and in temperament. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Those who have no guile find it very difficult to assume
guile in others. It never occurred to Gedaliah that Jews would return to the
Land for any reason other than the highest motive of patriotism. The only
protection that Gedaliah had was to understand that everyone has an old sin
nature. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Furthermore, the happiness interlude deceived Gedaliah
into a position of watering down Bible doctrine. He thought that Bible doctrine
was not needed anymore because there was no pressure! When you get away from
Bible doctrine and rely on emotions only, you may feel that you can love
everyone and trust everyone. Gedaliah fell into that trap. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Gedaliah had forgotten that those who had returned from
Ammon, Moab and Edom were not Word of God types. They were not the Bible class
crowd. Some were believers and some were unbelievers. Some were apostates. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Leadership demands discernment. No one can stay in
leadership without it. The way to start is to assume that everyone is a
jackass. This isn’t always true, but this is just where you should start.
Leadership demands that you assume the worst about everyone! </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is not only protection for the leader, but the ones they
lead. Everyone has an old sin nature, believers and unbelievers. This applies
to nice people, nasty people, fat people, slim people, red heads, blue heads,
knot heads, what have you. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Gedaliah lost his sharpness. Leadership must depend upon
doctrine. Gedaliah’s naivete resulted in his own tragic death and a civil war.
He had a mild emotional revolt as contrasted with a strong emotional revolt.
Mild emotional revolt is loving the brethren, being altruistic, being sentimental,
and responding to everyone. His arms were open wide. He welcomed Ishmael who
would kill him! </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>On the other hand, David passed his prosperity test. In 2
Samuel 23:13-17, David poured the water on the ground because he saw that his
soldiers loved him so much that they would risk their lives to get him a drink
of water. He knew that if he drank that water he would not be able to order his
men into dangerous field assignments. He would be unfair and unfit as a field
commander! </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then three of the thirty chief men went down and came to David
in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam, while the troop of the Philistines
was camping in the valley of Rephaim. David was then in the stronghold, while
the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem. David had a craving and
said, &quot;Oh that someone would give me water to drink from the well of
Bethlehem which is by the gate!&quot; So the three mighty men broke through the
camp of the Philistines, and drew water from the well of Bethlehem which was by
the gate, and took it and brought it to David. Nevertheless he would not drink
it, but poured it out to the LORD; and he said, &quot;Be it far from me, O
LORD, that I should do this. Shall I drink the blood of the men who went in
jeopardy of their lives?&quot; Therefore he would not drink it. These things
the three mighty men did.” (2 Samuel 23:13-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In his fantastic maturity, he poured the water on the
ground (rejected it) so he could objectively rotate his men into the tough
assignments. He would have to send some of these men to their deaths at one
time or another. If he drank that water, he would have been weakened and would
feel that he couldn’t assign them to battle where they could die. In future
days, he would cater to the one who brought him the water and he would become
unfair and preferential. </p>
