<h2>Tribulation, Doctrinal Significance of The Roman Empire </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Daniel 2</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The context of Daniel 2 is the four Gentile world powers
dominating the earth prior to the coming kingdom of Christ. These four Gentile
world powers Babylon, Media-Persia, Greece and Rome constitute the time of the
Gentiles. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Daniel 2:40-41 talks about the fourth kingdom, the Roman
Empire and describes the fourth kingdom from man’s view point. Strong,
conquering and with two legs and ten toes. The fourth kingdom is a dual type
kingdom. Two phases as to time. Two parts as to geography, the Eastern and
Western. Two characteristics as to make-up, religious and political.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Then there will be a fourth kingdom as strong as iron;
inasmuch as iron crushes and shatters all things, so, like iron that breaks in
pieces, it will crush and break all these in pieces. &quot;In that you saw the
feet and toes, partly of potter's clay and partly of iron, it will be a divided
kingdom; but it will have in it the toughness of iron, inasmuch as you saw the
iron mixed with common clay.” (Daniel 2:40-41, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The kingdom will be divided with the strength and
toughness of iron and the weakness of clay. The mixing of iron and clay occurs
simultaneously, not chronologically. They both occur together. The iron and
clay is a mixture of peoples around the world. There is dissention in the ranks
of the people, partly weak, partly strong.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Daniel 7</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The context of Daniel 7:7-8 is the four kingdoms of the
time of the Gentiles. This time is from God’s standpoint. God considers them
bestial. They are Babylon, Media-Persia, Greece, and Rome.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;After this I kept looking in the night visions, and
behold, a fourth beast, dreadful and terrifying and extremely strong; and it
had large iron teeth. It devoured and crushed and trampled down the remainder
with its feet; and it was different from all the beasts that were before it,
and it had ten horns. &quot;While I was contemplating the horns, behold,
another horn, a little one, came up among them, and three of the first horns
were pulled out by the roots before it; and behold, this horn possessed eyes
like the eyes of a man and a mouth uttering great boasts.” (Daniel 7:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Daniel 7:7 refers to the fourth kingdom, Rome. The fourth
kingdom is described as a beast. Note that it is the kingdom described as a
beast, not a person. This will help in the Revelation 13 exegesis. Daniel 7:7
describes the fourth beast as different from the others and having ten horns.
In Daniel 7:8, the little horn is a person, whereas the ten horns are ten
kingdoms.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The little horn of Daniel 7 is not the same as the little
horn of Daniel 8. The little horn of Daniel 7 roots out three of the ten
kingdoms (yet future). The little horn of Daniel 7 is the Dictator of the
Revived Roman Empire and is described as having great perception and great
communication ability.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Revelation 13</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The context of Revelation 13 is the Tribulation, which is
yet future. The Tribulation is future to John at his writing and future to us.
Therefore, the facts of Revelation 13 which relate to the Tribulation must also
be future. However, the facts that relate to the fourth kingdom may be past or
may be future, depending on which part of the Roman Empire it is talking about.
If the phase one part is being discussed then it would be past, prior to 476
AD. If the part discussed is Tribulational, then, of course, it would be
future.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The beast out of the sea is the fourth Gentile power of
Daniel 7. This beast is the Roman Empire. Therefore, in the Book of Revelation
when the beast is discussed it is talking about the Roman Empire, sometimes the
part that is past and sometimes the Tribulational phase which is future.
Nevertheless, the fourth Gentile world power is in view.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fourth beast is described in Revelation 13. The beast
has seven heads. Part of which we will find in Revelation 17 is past, some
present, and some future. It has ten horns. These are ten kingdoms with heads
of state called kings and these are ALL future, not only to John but also to
us. It has ten crowns. This is the emphasis on the right to rule and the
position of the heads of state.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fourth kingdom is seen in Revelation as a composite
beast, a picture of the characteristics of the others all wrapped up into one.
This kingdom has all the previous characteristics. The head of this kingdom
gets his power, seat of office, and his right of authority directly from Satan.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fourth kingdom has seven heads (not people). One of
the seven heads is wounded. The wounded head is revived. The world wonders at
this. The actions of this revived head (type of government) is described in
Revelation 13:4-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“they worshiped the dragon because he gave his authority to the
beast; and they worshiped the beast, saying, &quot;Who is like the beast, and
who is able to wage war with him?&quot; There was given to him a mouth speaking
arrogant words and blasphemies, and authority to act for forty-two months was
given to him. And he opened his mouth in blasphemies against God, to blaspheme
His name and His tabernacle, that is, those who dwell in heaven. It was also
given to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them, and authority
over every tribe and people and tongue and nation was given to him. All who
dwell on the earth will worship him, everyone whose name has not been written
from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb who has been
slain. If anyone has an ear, let him hear. If anyone is destined for captivity,
to captivity he goes; if anyone kills with the sword, with the sword he must be
killed. Here is the perseverance and the faith of the saints.” (Revelation
13:4-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The second beast of Revelation 13 is another of the same
kind. This beast is another power of the same kind expressed through a person
or course. This power embodied in a person arises from the “earth” which is
technical for the land of Palestine, the Jewish people. This second beast would
be the power and person of the dictator of Palestine in the Tribulational
period. The activities of the second beast in his relation to the first beast
are described in Revelation 13:12-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He exercises all the authority of the first beast in his
presence. And he makes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first
beast, whose fatal wound was healed. He performs great signs, so that he even
makes fire come down out of heaven to the earth in the presence of men. And he
deceives those who dwell on the earth because of the signs which it was given
him to perform in the presence of the beast, telling those who dwell on the
earth to make an image to the beast who had the wound of the sword and has come
to life. And it was given to him to give breath to the image of the beast, so
that the image of the beast would even speak and cause as many as do not
worship the image of the beast to be killed. And he causes all, the small and
the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free men and the slaves, to be
given a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, and he provides that no
one will be able to buy or to sell, except the one who has the mark, either the
name of the beast or the number of his name. Here is wisdom. Let him who has
understanding calculate the number of the beast, for the number is that of a
man; and his number is six hundred and sixty-six.” (Revelation 13:12-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Revelation 17 - The Great Harlot</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Revelation 17:1-18 gives the different phases of the
fourth kingdom, the Roman Empire. The Great Harlot of Revelation 17:1 and the
woman of Revelation 17:3-6, Revelation 17:9 and Revelation 17:18 are not the
same designation. The Great Harlot is the religious harlot system whereas the
woman is a designation of the city of Rome. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and
spoke with me, saying, &quot;Come here, I will show you the judgment of the
great harlot who sits on many waters,” (Revelation 17:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And he carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness; and I
saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast, full of blasphemous names, having seven
heads and ten horns. The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and adorned
with gold and precious stones and pearls, having in her hand a gold cup full of
abominations and of the unclean things of her immorality, and on her forehead a
name was written, a mystery, &quot;BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND
OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.&quot; And I saw the woman drunk with the
blood of the saints, and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. When I saw
her, I wondered greatly.” (Revelation 17:3-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Here is the mind which has wisdom. The seven heads are
seven mountains on which the woman sits,” (Revelation 17:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;The woman whom you saw is the great city, which reigns
over the kings of the earth.&quot;” (Revelation 17:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Great Harlot in Revelation 17 is universal in scope,
has been embraced by kings from all over the earth, has made the people of the
earth “drunk,” and is the religious harlot system. The religious harlot system
will be destroyed by the peoples under it and in its place will be allegiance
to the antichrist and his political system. Rev.17:1-3; Rev. 17:15-16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and
spoke with me, saying, &quot;Come here, I will show you the judgment of the
great harlot who sits on many waters, with whom the kings of the earth
committed acts of immorality, and those who dwell on the earth were made drunk
with the wine of her immorality.&quot; And he carried me away in the Spirit
into a wilderness; and I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast, full of
blasphemous names, having seven heads and ten horns.” (Revelation 17:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And he said to me, &quot;The waters which you saw where the
harlot sits, are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues. &quot;And the
ten horns which you saw, and the beast, these will hate the harlot and will
make her desolate and naked, and will eat her flesh and will burn her up with
fire.” (Revelation 17:15-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Revelation 17 - The Woman</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The woman of Revelation 17 is the city of Rome, clothed
with scarlet and riding the beast, the Roman Empire. The woman is described in
splendor from the human viewpoint and in iniquity from God’s viewpoint. The
woman is described as the mother city of the harlot religious system and a
persecutor of the saints and producing great awe. Rev. 17:3-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And he carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness; and I
saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast, full of blasphemous names, having seven
heads and ten horns. The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and adorned
with gold and precious stones and pearls, having in her hand a gold cup full of
abominations and of the unclean things of her immorality, and on her forehead a
name was written, a mystery, &quot;BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND
OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.&quot; And I saw the woman drunk with the
blood of the saints, and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. When I saw
her, I wondered greatly.” (Revelation 17:3-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The mystery of the woman is revealed in Revelation 17:7
and is stated in the rest of the chapter. She is riding on the beast, the Roman
Empire. The City of Rome is carried by the Empire. The woman is sitting on
seven mountains which are seven forms of government or powers. The term
“mountain” in Revelation 17:9 is equal to the Old Testament concept of “horn.”
The woman, the city of Rome, will reign over the Revived Roman Empire as the
location of the political center of the Revived Roman Empire, the fourth Gentile
world power.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the angel said to me, &quot;Why do you wonder? I will tell
you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries her, which has the
seven heads and the ten horns.” (Revelation 17:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Here is the mind which has wisdom. The seven heads are
seven mountains on which the woman sits,” (Revelation 17:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Revelation 17 - The Beast</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The beast is the Roman Empire often represented by its
head of state. It is seen being ridden by the “woman,” the city of Rome. Rome
is the capital of the Roman Empire. It is seen as having seven heads (forms of
government) and ten kingdoms (horns), national cooperative entities. Rev.17:3;
Rev.17:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And he carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness; and I
saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast, full of blasphemous names, having seven
heads and ten horns.” (Revelation 17:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the angel said to me, &quot;Why do you wonder? I will tell
you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries her, which has the
seven heads and the ten horns.” (Revelation 17:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The beast is seen in three stages in Revelation 17:8. 
Stage 1 is from the beginning to 476 AD, “was.”  Stage 2 is from 476 AD to an
indefinite time, “is not.”  Stage 3 “shall ascend out of the bottomless pit,”
refers to the future in a Revived Roman Empire status.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to
come up out of the abyss and go to destruction. And those who dwell on the
earth, whose name has not been written in the book of life from the foundation
of the world, will wonder when they see the beast, that he was and is not and
will come.” (Revelation 17:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The beast is seen having seven heads which is equivalent
to the seven mountains in Revelation 17:9-10. The seven heads or seven
mountains are past, before John, one present to John and one yet future. The
first five heads are five forms of government of the Roman Empire up to Julius
Caesar. The sixth power or head is the imperial power of the Roman Empire of
John’s day up to 476 AD. The seventh head is the Revived Roman Empire power,
yet future, and the eighth is the person of the antichrist who arises out of
the seventh power. The man out of the Empire. Rev.17:10-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Here is the mind which has wisdom. The seven heads are
seven mountains on which the woman sits, and they are seven kings; five have
fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; and when he comes, he must remain a
little while.” (Revelation 17:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and they are seven kings; five have fallen, one is, the other
has not yet come; and when he comes, he must remain a little while. &quot;The
beast which was and is not, is himself also an eighth and is one of the seven,
and he goes to destruction.” (Revelation 17:10-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fourth kingdom will have ten horns and ten kings, the
power and the persons, yet future. They will get their authority from the head
of the Revived Roman Empire. These 10 nations or kingdoms give all their
allegiance to the fourth kingdom. They will unite in war against Christ and
lose. Rev. 17:12-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;The ten horns which you saw are ten kings who have not
yet received a kingdom, but they receive authority as kings with the beast for
one hour. &quot;These have one purpose, and they give their power and authority
to the beast. &quot;These will wage war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will
overcome them, because He is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those who are
with Him are the called and chosen and faithful.&quot;” (Revelation 17:12-14,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The people under the domination of the religious harlot
system shall turn their allegiance from that religious system and give it to
the great political ten national empire of the antichrist. Rev.17:15-16. They
will destroy the religious harlot system in the process.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And he said to me, &quot;The waters which you saw where the
harlot sits, are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues. &quot;And the
ten horns which you saw, and the beast, these will hate the harlot and will
make her desolate and naked, and will eat her flesh and will burn her up with
fire.” (Revelation 17:15-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The geographical center for the activity of this fourth
bestial kingdom, the Revived Roman Empire, is the city of Rome from which the
world of nations, ten kingdoms, specifically will be governed. In Revelation
18, the destruction of this great Empire of Rome is described. This will take
place at the end or near the end of the Tribulation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Revelation 12 and 13</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Revelation 12:3-4, we have the seven head and ten horn
beast directly related to the fall of Satan in heaven, thus tying it directly
with the Angelic Conflict and also the functioning opposition to the nation
Israel who is the woman in this passage. The child is a reference to Christ,
the woman to Israel, the dragon to Satan. The dragon of Revelation 12:3 is
parallel to the dragon of Revelation 13:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then another sign appeared in heaven: and behold, a great red
dragon having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads were seven diadems.
And his tail swept away a third of the stars of heaven and threw them to the
earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so
that when she gave birth he might devour her child.” (Revelation 12:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“they worshiped the dragon because he gave his authority to the
beast; and they worshiped the beast, saying, &quot;Who is like the beast, and
who is able to wage war with him?&quot;” (Revelation 13:4, NASB)</p>
