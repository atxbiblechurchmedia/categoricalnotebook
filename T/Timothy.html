<h2>Timothy</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Timothy was of Jewish background and was raised by his
mother and grandmother who led him to Christ. He was a believer from a very
early age and was taught thoroughly by these women. He was quite mature
spiritually in youth. 2 Tim. 1:5; 2 Tim. 3:15. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For I am mindful of the sincere faith within you, which first
dwelt in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am sure that it is
in you as well.” (2 Timothy 1:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and that from childhood you have known the sacred writings
which are able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith
which is in Christ Jesus.” (2 Timothy 3:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Timothy was trained by Paul who lectured to him while
walking from place to place as was the habit of Aristotle in his day. Timothy
then had apostolic training. He had the spiritual gift of pastor-teacher. He
had a milder approach or character and was not the troubleshooting type. Acts
20:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And he was accompanied by Sopater of Berea, the son of
Pyrrhus, and by Aristarchus and Secundus of the Thessalonians, and Gaius of
Derbe, and Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia.” (Acts 20:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As a pastor-teacher, Timothy had to know about God's grace.
Spiritual maturity gives you a capacity for freedom, for life, for love, for
happiness, for grace, for grace reception, and for prosperity. Spiritual
maturity gives you the ability to handle any disaster, difficulty, or tragedy
of life. In 2 Timothy 2:1, “be strong in the grace” refers to undeserved
suffering. Phil. 3:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“You therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in
Christ Jesus.” (2 Timothy 2:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection and the
fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death;” (Philippians 3:10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Timothy had to be taught so he put himself under the
authority of Paul. In 2 Timothy 2:2, four verbs are used to describe this
training. “Heard” is the aorist active indicative of  <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span
lang=EL>κου</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (akouō) and means to hear, to attend
to, to consider what is or has been said, to understand, to perceive the sense
of what is said. “Entrust” is the aorist middle imperative of <span lang=EL>παρατι</span>́<span
lang=EL>θημι</span> (paratithēmi) and means to place alongside, to deposit, to
entrust, to train in accordance with the rules (the decrees of pastor-teachers).</p>

<p class=Verses>“The things which you have heard from me in the presence of
many witnesses, entrust these to faithful men who will be able to teach others
also.” (2 Timothy 2:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A true pastor-teacher will always be training other
pastor-teachers. He will be benefitted by doing so. He must do it. It is a
command. “Faithful men” is <span lang=EL>πιστοίς</span><span lang=EL> </span><span
lang=EL>άνθρωποις</span><span lang=EL> </span>and refers to a trainer of
pastors who will teach by commands. A trainer of pastors will be benefitted. A
trainer of pastors will teach men summed up by one word, faithful. Faithful is
the summation of their response to Bible doctrine as viewed by the pastor-teacher.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Shall be able” is the future middle indicative of <span
lang=EL>ε</span>̓́<span lang=EL>σομαι</span> (esomai) and means that in
preparation their pastoring is still future. They shall teach, but the deposit
is made in preparation. “Teach” is the aorist active infinitive of <span
lang=EL>διδα</span>́<span lang=EL>σκω</span> (didaskō). The infinitive
expresses that the purpose of the instruction is that the ones taught may teach
one day. “Others also” refers to the pastor-teacher’s own congregation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Timothy had to be tough. In 2 Timothy 2:3, “Suffer hardship”
is the aorist active imperative of  <span lang=EL>συγκακοπαθε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (sugkakopatheō) and means to endure evil, the negative
volition, the guff from others. It means to stand up to any temptations that the
world, the flesh, and the devil throw at you.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Suffer hardship with me, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.”
(2 Timothy 2:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He will have to bear the hardships and still behave as a positive
soldier. He will have to be authority oriented, able to endure discipline from
those above him, to exercise self-discipline, and to be clear headed while
tired. A tired foot soldier sleeps well. He must develop a toughness that
endures the best the enemy can muster. Prov. 24:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If you are slack in the day of distress, Your strength is
limited.” (Proverbs 24:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Timothy had to learn to be rigidly disciplined.  In 2 Timothy
2:4, “No soldier in active service” is the present active participle of <span
lang=EL>στρατευ</span>́<span lang=EL>ομαι</span> (strateuomai) and means to be
on active military service, to be a soldier encamped and ready to do battle. “Entangles”
is the present passive indicative of <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>μπλε</span>́<span
lang=EL>κω</span> (emplekō) and means to receive entanglement, to get caught
in a web of life’s details such as finances, etc. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“That he may please” is the aorist active subjunctive of <span
lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>ρε</span>́<span lang=EL>σκω</span> (areskō) and
means the potential to endeavor or strive to please, to accommodate one’s self
to the opinions, desires, and interests of others. “The one who enlisted him”
is the aorist active participle of <span lang=EL>στρατολογε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (stratologeō) and means to name or call as a soldier. The soldier
focuses on the one who is training him and strives to please him.</p>

<p class=Verses>“No soldier in active service entangles himself in the affairs
of everyday life, so that he may please the one who enlisted him as a soldier.”
(2 Timothy 2:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Timothy must exhibit progress, performance, and
competitive ability in the Angelic Conflict. In 2 Timothy 2:5, “if anyone
competes” is the third class condition of <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>α</span>́<span
lang=EL>ν</span> (ean) plus the present active subjective of <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span
lang=EL>θλε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (athleō) and means maybe he will,
maybe he won’t contend in games, to wrestle. This is the Angelic Conflict.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Also if anyone competes as an athlete, he does not win the
prize unless he competes according to the rules.” (2 Timothy 2:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>By application, in 1 Corinthians 9:24, “all run” refers
to all believers each of which are in the race of the Angelic Conflict. “The prize”
is <span lang=EL>βραβει</span>͂<span lang=EL>ον</span> (brabeion) and refers to
the heavenly reward for the believer. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but only
one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may win.” (1 Corinthians
9:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 9:25, “competes” is the present middle
participle of <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>γωνι</span>́<span lang=EL>ζομαι</span>
(agōnizomai) and means to strive, to contend with adversaries, to fight. It
means to be under undeserved suffering under rigid training rules, to be
presented with a challenge, a goal. “Exercises self-control” is the present
middle indicative of <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>γκρατευ</span>́<span
lang=EL>ομαι</span> (egkrateuomai) and means to be under discipline and
self-control, to have the inner strength and challenge to put yourself under
rigorous discipline.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Everyone who competes in the games exercises self-control in
all things. They then do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an
imperishable.” (1 Corinthians 9:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 9:26, “not without aim” is <span
lang=EL>ουκ</span><span lang=EL> </span><span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>δη</span>́<span
lang=EL>λως</span> (ouk adēlōs) and denotes to not run with indistinct,
uncertain, or bad eyesight, to not run blind. The terrific pressure of the Angelic
Conflict causes aberrations such as Pentecostalism. “I box” is <span lang=EL>πυκτε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (pukteō) and refers to a boxer, a pugilist who punches where
it counts. “Not beating the air” is <span lang=EL>ουκ</span><span lang=EL> </span><span
lang=EL>δε</span>́<span lang=EL>ρω</span> (ouk derō) and means a violent blow,
a thrashing about, activity like a whirlwind. This is shadow boxing.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore I run in such a way, as not without aim; I box in
such a way, as not beating the air;” (1 Corinthians 9:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 9:27, “but I discipline my body” is the
present active indicative of <span lang=EL>υ</span>̔<span lang=EL>πωπια</span>́<span
lang=EL>ζω</span> (hupōpiazō) and means like a boxer one buffets his body,
handles it roughly, is disciplined by hardships. It also refers to the part of
the face below the eyes, a blow on the face, to strike under the eye, to give a
black eye, to wear out, to buffet, to bruise.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but I discipline my body and make it my slave, so that, after
I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified.” (1 Corinthians
9:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Severe self-discipline was a way of life for him. “And
make it my slave” is the present active indicative of <span lang=EL>δουλαγωγε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (doulagōgeō) and means to make a slave, to bring into
bondage. This is very strong. To him, his body has no rights whatsoever. “After
I have preached to others” is the aorist active participle of <span lang=EL>κηρυ</span>́<span
lang=EL>σσω</span><span lang=EL> </span>(kērussō) and means to proclaim after
the manner of a herald, to preach. “I myself will not be disqualified” is <span
lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>δο</span>́<span lang=EL>κιμος</span> (adokimos)
and means not standing the test, to be disqualified, to be rejected, to fail
the test, to be rejected, to be unapproved.</p>
