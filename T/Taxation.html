<h2>Taxation </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The term “taxation” does not occur in the English Bible.
The words for taxation are translated “tithe” or “tribute” or occasionally “yoke.”
Taxation is a bona fide operation in a national entity. Keeping law and order
costs money. Certain privileges like highways, park systems, etc. enjoyed in a
nation cost money. Government leaders need to be supported. Bona fide welfare
costs money. Taxation was enjoined by the Lord Jesus Christ. From the
standpoint of the one being supported by taxes, it is a grace method. Why? They
don’t earn or deserve it! Rom. 13:1-7; Matt. 22:15-22. See category on <a
href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/WXYZ/Welfare.html">Welfare</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Every person is to be in subjection to the governing
authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist
are established by God. Therefore whoever resists authority has opposed the
ordinance of God; and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon
themselves. For rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior, but for evil.
Do you want to have no fear of authority? Do what is good and you will have
praise from the same; for it is a minister of God to you for good. But if you
do what is evil, be afraid; for it does not bear the sword for nothing; for it
is a minister of God, an avenger who brings wrath on the one who practices
evil. Therefore it is necessary to be in subjection, not only because of wrath,
but also for conscience' sake. For because of this you also pay taxes, for
rulers are servants of God, devoting themselves to this very thing. Render to
all what is due them: tax to whom tax is due; custom to whom custom; fear to
whom fear; honor to whom honor.” (Romans 13:1-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the Pharisees went and plotted together how they might
trap Him in what He said. And they sent their disciples to Him, along with the
Herodians, saying, &quot;Teacher, we know that You are truthful and teach the
way of God in truth, and defer to no one; for You are not partial to any.
&quot;Tell us then, what do You think? Is it lawful to give a poll-tax to
Caesar, or not?&quot; But Jesus perceived their malice, and said, &quot;Why are
you testing Me, you hypocrites? &quot;Show Me the coin used for the
poll-tax.&quot; And they brought Him a denarius. And He said to them,
&quot;Whose likeness and inscription is this?&quot; They said to Him,
&quot;Caesar's.&quot; Then He said to them, &quot;Then render to Caesar the
things that are Caesar's; and to God the things that are God's.&quot; And
hearing this, they were amazed, and leaving Him, they went away.” (Matthew
22:15-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Old Testament tithing system was a method of
taxation. Num. 18:21-24; Deut. 14:22-24; Deut. 14:28-29. See category on <a
href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/T/Tithing.html">Tithing</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;To the sons of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe
in Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service which they perform,
the service of the tent of meeting. &quot;The sons of Israel shall not come
near the tent of meeting again, or they will bear sin and die. &quot;Only the
Levites shall perform the service of the tent of meeting, and they shall bear
their iniquity; it shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations,
and among the sons of Israel they shall have no inheritance. &quot;For the
tithe of the sons of Israel, which they offer as an offering to the LORD, I
have given to the Levites for an inheritance; therefore I have said concerning
them, 'They shall have no inheritance among the sons of Israel.'&quot;”
(Numbers 18:21-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You shall surely tithe all the produce from what you
sow, which comes out of the field every year. &quot;You shall eat in the
presence of the LORD your God, at the place where He chooses to establish His
name, the tithe of your grain, your new wine, your oil, and the firstborn of
your herd and your flock, so that you may learn to fear the LORD your God
always. &quot;If the distance is so great for you that you are not able to
bring the tithe, since the place where the LORD your God chooses to set His
name is too far away from you when the LORD your God blesses you,” (Deuteronomy
14:22-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;At the end of every third year you shall bring out all
the tithe of your produce in that year, and shall deposit it in your town.
&quot;The Levite, because he has no portion or inheritance among you, and the
alien, the orphan and the widow who are in your town, shall come and eat and be
satisfied, in order that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of
your hand which you do.” (Deuteronomy 14:28-29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Taxation can be abused by graft which was a cause of splitting
of the Kingdom of Israel in 1 Kings 12:1-15. This caused excessive taxation
because luxurious living was being promoted.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Your father made our yoke hard; now therefore lighten
the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke which he put on us, and we
will serve you.&quot;” (1 Kings 12:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“'Whereas my father loaded you with a heavy yoke, I will add to
your yoke; my father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with
scorpions.'&quot;” (1 Kings 12:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Taxation can be abused within some misguided welfare
programs such as supporting those who are able to work. Taxation can also be
abused by guaranteed annual income programs. 2 Thess. 3:6; 2 Thess. 3:10-12; 2
Thess. 3:14-15; Prov. 24:30-34.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ, that you keep away from every brother who leads an unruly life and not
according to the tradition which you received from us.” (2 Thessalonians 3:6,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For even when we were with you, we used to give you this
order: if anyone is not willing to work, then he is not to eat, either. For we
hear that some among you are leading an undisciplined life, doing no work at
all, but acting like busybodies. Now such persons we command and exhort in the
Lord Jesus Christ to work in quiet fashion and eat their own bread.” (2
Thessalonians 3:10-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“If anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter, take
special note of that person and do not associate with him, so that he will be
put to shame. Yet do not regard him as an enemy, but admonish him as a
brother.” (2 Thessalonians 3:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“I passed by the field of the sluggard And by the vineyard of
the man lacking sense, And behold, it was completely overgrown with thistles;
Its surface was covered with nettles, And its stone wall was broken down. When
I saw, I reflected upon it; I looked, and received instruction. &quot;A little
sleep, a little slumber, A little folding of the hands to rest,&quot; Then your
poverty will come as a robber And your want like an armed man.” (Proverbs
24:30-34, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Taxation can be abused by socialized medicine programs
with cradle to grave care. This violates free enterprise and takes private
practice and makes it a federal program with the resultant red tape. Such
Socialism violates volition in that participation is mandatory. Such programs
also violate the discipline of God that life was designed to contain trial,
heartache, and difficulty to define you and provide opportunities to rely more
on the grace provisions of God.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Taxation can be abused by federal urban renewal programs
where free housing is provided and not cared for by the occupants. They often
become unlivable not too many years after completion. Taxation can be abused by
the federal government bailing out bankrupt companies. They should come and go
based on the markets they serve and free enterprise.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Whenever the federal government takes over and you get
some free payment, that payment has strings attached that take some of your
freedoms away. As the government’s paper work grows more and more, they need
more staff to process the slavery. Before too long, the goose that laid the
golden egg is dead. Abused taxation can ultimately bankrupt a nation and will
cause slavery. Slaves don’t pay taxes. Lev. 26:25-26.</p>

<p class=Verses>“'I will also bring upon you a sword which will execute
vengeance for the covenant; and when you gather together into your cities, I
will send pestilence among you, so that you shall be delivered into enemy
hands. 'When I break your staff of bread, ten women will bake your bread in one
oven, and they will bring back your bread in rationed amounts, so that you will
eat and not be satisfied.” (Leviticus 26:25-26, NASB)</p>
