<h2><a name="_The_Trinity_2"></a>The Trinity</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Trinity is God the Father, God the Son, and God the
Holy Spirit. God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit are not three
Gods, but one God, without blending or dividing of substance. Yet, they are
presented with distinctions as three separate persons in the union of one. The
Trinity is defined as the union of three in one and is revealed as a bona fide
doctrine in Scripture. 1 Peter 1:2; 2 Cor. 13:14; Matt. 28:19; John 10:30;
Psalms 110:1; Isaiah 48:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by the
sanctifying work of the Spirit, to obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with His
blood: May grace and peace be yours in the fullest measure.” (1 Peter 1:2,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and
the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.” (2 Corinthians 13:14,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations,
baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit,”
(Matthew 28:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I and the Father are one.&quot;” (John 10:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“A Psalm of David. The LORD says to my Lord: &quot;Sit at My
right hand Until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.&quot;” (Psalms
110:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Come near to Me, listen to this: From the first I have
not spoken in secret, From the time it took place, I was there. And now the
Lord GOD has sent Me, and His Spirit.&quot;” (Isaiah 48:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The phrases “let Us” and “one of Us” indicate more than
one person in the Godhead. Gen. 1:26; Gen. 3:22; Gen. 11:7.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then God said, &quot;Let Us make man in Our image, according
to Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds
of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth, and over every creeping
thing that creeps on the earth.&quot;” (Genesis 1:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD God said, &quot;Behold, the man has become like
one of Us, knowing good and evil; and now, he might stretch out his hand, and
take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live forever&quot;—” (Genesis
3:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Come, let Us go down and there confuse their language,
so that they will not understand one another's speech.&quot;” (Genesis 11:7,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is the only visible member of the Trinity.
He is the unique God-man – perfect undiminished deity and perfect sinless
humanity in one person forever. John 1:18; John 6:46; 1 Tim. 6:16; 1 John 4:12;
Col. 1:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“No one has seen God at any time; the only begotten God who is
in the bosom of the Father, He has explained Him.” (John 1:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Not that anyone has seen the Father, except the One who
is from God; He has seen the Father.” (John 6:46, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“who alone possesses immortality and dwells in unapproachable
light, whom no man has seen or can see. To Him be honor and eternal dominion!
Amen.” (1 Timothy 6:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“No one has seen God at any time; if we love one another, God
abides in us, and His love is perfected in us.” (1 John 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all
creation.” (Colossians 1:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>One in Essence</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When the Bible speaks of God being one, it is always
referring to essence, never to persons. The diagram below illustrates the
essence of God with respect to the Trinity whereby each Person of the Godhead
is coequal and co-eternal. Each member of the Trinity is perfect absolute
Sovereignty, Righteousness, Justice, Love , Eternal Life, Omniscience,
Omnipresence, Omnipotence, Immutability, and Veracity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><img width=350 height=290 id="Picture 1"
src="The%20Trinity.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Each person in the Trinity has identical essence or
attributes, making each one equal to the others. John 16:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;All things that the Father has are Mine; therefore I
said that He takes of Mine and will disclose it to you.” (John 16:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is spirit. John 4:24. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in
spirit and truth.&quot;” (John 4:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 138:2, the word “Your” is in the singular. This
verse emphasizes the importance of knowing the Word of God, Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I will bow down toward Your holy temple And give thanks to
Your name for Your lovingkindness and Your truth; For You have magnified Your
word according to all Your name.” (Psalms 138:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Deuteronomy 6:4 and Mark 12:29 speak of “the LORD is one”
and “one Lord.”</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Hear, O Israel! The LORD is our God, the LORD is one!”
(Deuteronomy 6:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Jesus answered, &quot;The foremost is, 'HEAR, O ISRAEL! THE
LORD OUR GOD IS ONE LORD;” (Mark 12:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>John 10:30 speaks of the Lord Jesus Christ and God the
Father being one. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I and the Father are one.&quot;” (John 10:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 110:1, God the Father “The Lord” is talking to
“my Lord” the Lord Jesus Christ.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“A Psalm of David. The LORD says to my Lord: &quot;Sit at My
right hand Until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.&quot;” (Psalms
110:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Isaiah 6:3 speaks of God “Holy (Father), Holy (Son), Holy
(Holy Spirit)” as the Lord of Hosts. One Lord. See category on <a
href="#_Essence_of_God">Essence of God</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And one called out to another and said, &quot;Holy, Holy,
Holy, is the LORD of hosts, The whole earth is full of His glory.&quot;”
(Isaiah 6:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Three in Personality</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When the Bible distinguishes between the three persons of
the Godhead, it is in reference to an activity, operation, or function of a
specific person in the Godhead. Each member of the Trinity performs a different
function in relationship to mankind and angels. God is one in essence and three
in personality. Matt. 28:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations,
baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit,”
(Matthew 28:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Father formulated the plan of God. God the Son
executed that plan by coming to earth, taking on the form of man, remaining
sinless throughout His life, and then dying spiritually on the Cross for all of
the sins of mankind. God the Holy Spirit is the revealer of that plan. He
reveals the person and work of Christ to us so that we may accept this
provision and this promise of eternal life for those that believe. In Genesis
1:2, God the Holy Spirit was with God the Father.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The earth was formless and void, and darkness was over the
surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was moving over the surface of the
waters.” (Genesis 1:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 48:16 and John 1:1, God the Son (the Word) was
with God the Father. God the Son has always been eternal God. </p>

<p class=Verses>“The angel who has redeemed me from all evil, Bless the lads;
And may my name live on in them, And the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac;
And may they grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.&quot;” (Genesis
48:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and
the Word was God.” (John 1:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All three persons of the Trinity are named in 2
Corinthians 13:14 and Isaiah 61:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and
the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.” (2 Corinthians 13:14,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me, Because the LORD has
anointed me To bring good news to the afflicted; He has sent me to bind up the
brokenhearted, To proclaim liberty to captives And freedom to prisoners;”
(Isaiah 61:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The three persons of the Godhead are all co-equal and
co-eternal. 1 Peter 1:3; 2 Cor. 13:14; Matt. 28:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
who according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living
hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,&quot;  (1 Peter
1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God,
and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.&quot;  (2 Corinthians
13:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;Go therefore and make disciples of all the
nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy
Spirit, &quot;  (Matthew 28:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Light can be used to illustrate the three persons of the
Trinity. Light has three separate and distinct properties based on the light
wavelengths or portion of the light spectrum involved - actinic, luminiferous,
and calorific. Actinic light is the shorter wavelengths, ultraviolet radiant
energy and is neither seen nor felt. This is a perfect analogy of God the
Father. John 1:18. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;No one has seen God at any time; the only begotten God
who is in the bosom of the Father, He has explained Him. &quot;  (John 1:18,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Luminiferous light is the medium wavelengths and can be
seen and felt. This is a good analogy of God the Son. Calorific light is the
longer wavelengths and cannot be seen, but can be felt as heat. Calorific light
is a perfect analogy of God the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Therefore, the composition of light is analogous to the
three persons in the Godhead who are one in essence. Light is one with three
properties. God is one in essence, but three separate persons with different
activities and functions in the plan of God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Trinity’s Activities At the Baptism of Jesus
Christ </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the Baptism of Jesus Christ, all three members of the
Trinity or Godhead manifested themselves to the human race at the same time and
in one place. Matthew 3:13-17 is a perfect example of God revealing Himself to
mankind as three distinct persons at the same time. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Jesus arrived from Galilee at the Jordan coming to John,
to be baptized by him. But John tried to prevent Him, saying, &quot;I have need
to be baptized by You, and do You come to me?&quot; But Jesus answering said to
him, &quot;Permit it at this time; for in this way it is fitting for us to
fulfill all righteousness.&quot; Then he permitted Him. After being baptized,
Jesus came up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened,
and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove and lighting on Him, and behold,
a voice out of the heavens said, &quot;This is My beloved Son, in whom I am
well-pleased.&quot;” (Matthew 3:13-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 1:32-34, God the Father was the voice from
heaven, the unique God-man Jesus Christ was physically on earth, and the Holy
Spirit came down through the air. God had told John that the One on whom the
Holy Spirit descended in the form of a dove would be the Lord Jesus Christ. </p>

<p class=Verses>“John testified saying, &quot;I have seen the Spirit descending
as a dove out of heaven, and He remained upon Him. &quot;I did not recognize
Him, but He who sent me to baptize in water said to me, 'He upon whom you see
the Spirit descending and remaining upon Him, this is the One who baptizes in
the Holy Spirit.' &quot;I myself have seen, and have testified that this is the
Son of God.&quot;” (John 1:32-34, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 3:13, John the Baptist had just told them in
Matthew 3:11 that the Messiah, Jesus Christ would make a dramatic appearance. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;As for me, I baptize you with water for repentance, but
He who is coming after me is mightier than I, and I am not fit to remove His
sandals; He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.” (Matthew 3:11,
NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Jesus arrived from Galilee at the Jordan coming to John,
to be baptized by him.” (Matthew 3:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 3:14, John had been announcing Jesus Christ as
King. Jesus requested baptism, but He was not a sinner. In Matthew 3:15, all
righteousness was fulfilled by Jesus Christ at the Cross. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But John tried to prevent Him, saying, &quot;I have need to be
baptized by You, and do You come to me?&quot;” (Matthew 3:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But Jesus answering said to him, &quot;Permit it at this time;
for in this way it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.&quot; Then
he permitted Him.” (Matthew 3:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In His deity, He was absolute righteousness (+R). In His
humanity, He was sinless. He rejected man’s righteousness. No human good or
works were acceptable. Righteousness brought Jesus to the Cross, whereas sin
brings the human race for salvation. Rom. 4:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now to the one who works, his wage is not credited as a favor,
but as what is due.” (Romans 4:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 3:17, God the Father showed that He was well
pleased with His Son. </p>

<p class=Verses>“and behold, a voice out of the heavens said, &quot;This is My
beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleased.&quot;” (Matthew 3:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Son showed that He was willing to do the will of
the Father. In Hebrews 10:7-9, “the first” refers to the Mosaic Law and “the
second” refers to the New Covenant of salvation. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;THEN I SAID, 'BEHOLD, I HAVE COME (IN THE SCROLL OF THE
BOOK IT IS WRITTEN OF ME) TO DO YOUR WILL, O GOD.'&quot; After saying above,
&quot;SACRIFICES AND OFFERINGS AND WHOLE BURNT OFFERINGS AND sacrifices FOR SIN
YOU HAVE NOT DESIRED, NOR HAVE YOU TAKEN PLEASURE in them&quot; (which are
offered according to the Law), then He said, &quot;BEHOLD, I HAVE COME TO DO
YOUR WILL.&quot; He takes away the first in order to establish the second.”
(Hebrews 10:7-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Holy Spirit showed that He would empower and sustain
the humanity of Jesus Christ throughout His entire incarnation by filling His
soul without measure. All Church Age believers are also filled with and
sustained by the Holy Spirit in the spiritual life. John 3:34.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for He
gives the Spirit without measure.” (John 3:34, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Trinity’s Activities In Creation </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Each member of the Trinity had a part in creation. The
Father planned it. The Son created the universe. The Holy Spirit restored the
earth. God the Father is the planner of all things. 1 Cor. 8:6.  See category
on the <a href="#_The_Plan_of_1">Plan of God</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom are all
things and we exist for Him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom are all
things, and we exist through Him.” (1 Corinthians 8:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Son does the work relative to the plan of God the
Father. The Son created the universe, angels, and man. The Lord Jesus Christ is
the creator of all things. Eph. 3:9. </p>

<p class=Verses>“and to bring to light what is the administration of the
mystery which for ages has been hidden in God who created all things;”
(Ephesians 3:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Son (the deity of the Lord Jesus Christ) created
the universe and the original earth out of nothing. God the Son also created
the inner invisible part of man. Heb 1:10; John 1:3; Col. 1:16-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And, &quot;YOU, LORD, IN THE BEGINNING LAID THE FOUNDATION OF
THE EARTH, AND THE HEAVENS ARE THE WORKS OF YOUR HANDS;” (Hebrews 1:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him
nothing came into being that has come into being.” (John 1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For by Him all things were created, both in the heavens and on
earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or
authorities—all things have been created through Him and for Him. He is before
all things, and in Him all things hold together.” (Colossians 1:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 1:1, Isaiah 45:18, and Genesis 1:27, the
Hebrew word “created” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>בָּרָא</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(bara) and means to
create something out of nothing. </p>

<p class=Verses>“In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.”
(Genesis 1:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“God created man in His own image, in the image of God He
created him; male and female He created them.” (Genesis 1:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Isaiah 45:18, “formed” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>יצר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(yâtsar) and means shaped or molded out of existing
materials. The Son of God (Jesus Christ) formed the earth out of existing
materials that He had earlier created out of nothing. Jesus Christ created the
structure of Adam’s human body out of existing materials or chemicals. Gen.
2:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For thus says the LORD, who created the heavens (He is the God
who formed the earth and made it, He established it and did not create it a
waste place, but formed it to be inhabited), &quot;I am the LORD, and there is
none else.” (Isaiah 45:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD God formed man of dust from the ground, and
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being.”
(Genesis 2:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Isaiah 43:7, “created” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>בָּרָא</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(bara). “Formed” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>יצר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(yâtsar). “I have made” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>עָשָׂה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span

My glory, Whom I have formed, even whom I have made.&quot;” (Isaiah 43:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Holy Spirit restored the chaotic earth in six
literal 24-hour days. The entire universe including planet earth was originally
created by God the Son - Jesus Christ and He did it all instantaneously by
uttering a single word. The earth was originally created perfect and beautiful.
Satan and the angelic revolt ruined the earth and made it into an uninhabitable
and chaotic dump. The time of the restoration of the earth by God the Holy
Spirit is unknown. Gen. 1:2; Psalms 104:30.</p>

the Holy Spirit moved over the earth warming and melting the ice pack that had
surrounded the earth. This was the first step in the earth’s restoration. The
Holy Spirit restored the earth in six literal 24-hour days. God the Holy Spirit
restored the earth from existing chaotic materials, water, barrenness.  See

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Trinity’s Activities in Salvation </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Father planned salvation. The Son executed salvation
at the Cross. The Holy Spirit reveals the Father’s plan for salvation by making
the Gospel clear to the unbeliever. Each phase of the plan of God for mankind
is performed by a different member of the Godhead. Jesus Christ performed
salvation, the Holy Spirit empowers the believers’ spiritual life to fulfill
the Father’s plan for their lives, and God the Father handles eternity. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Each member of the Trinity performs a different function
in relationship to mankind. The work of the Lord Jesus Christ is general. It is
provided for the whole world (Unlimited Atonement), whether or not it is
accepted. The Holy Spirit performs the mechanics of salvation. The work of the
Holy Spirit is also specific and personal and is activated by the unbeliever’s
positive volition toward the saving work of Jesus Christ on the Cross.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer’s relationship with the Father is a child
relationship, friendship or fellowship with the Lord Jesus Christ, and a
functional relationship with the Holy Spirit.</p>
