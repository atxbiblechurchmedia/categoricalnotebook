<h2>Evangelistic Home Bible Class Manual</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The definition of a Home Bible Class is simply a group of
people meeting in a home to study the Word of God. There are two types of Home
Bible Classes - the Regular Home Bible Class and the Evangelistic Home Bible
Class.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Regular Home Bible Class usually involves Christians
and generally is taught by going through a book of the Bible such as Romans,
Hebrews, Revelation, etc. It may involve work books, a prescribed course of
study, and can be used very effectively to build up believers in the faith. A
study is available called The Believer’s Biblical Technique Class (mentioned
elsewhere in this course) and is representative of this type of class.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Evangelistic Home Bible Class is slanted toward the
unbeliever or the new convert and is designed for evangelistic outreach among
the “unreachables” and believers who have never understood salvation in its
basic elements. This class has proved very effective over the years.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is primarily a teacher’s manual, but can be used for
a pupil’s manual. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Suggestions For Teaching A Unique Home Bible Class</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Layman</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Bible has no such designation separating the
so-called clergy from the laity. But to communicate, we are forced to use the
popular designation. The Word of God indicates that a layman is as much in the
ministry as the pastor or missionary because both are full time believers.
There is tremendous untapped potential in the laymen in regard to teaching home
Bible classes. Laymen can teach these classes and do, by the hundreds. In
regard to teaching the evangelistic class, it is NOT limited to pastors, teachers,
missionaries only, but is a class that laymen can handle for His glory.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Christian Worker</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor, missionary or other Christian worker in “full
time Christian service” is a natural for this class, that is, if he is
interested in reaching the lost and has been somewhat frustrated in
accomplishing the task. Women have very effectively taught women’s classes and
men have taught men’s classes and have reaped a rich harvest. Teenagers,
college students, and even junior age children have eagerly responded to the
evangelistic home Bible class. Often it will be the pastor who teaches his lay
people how to successfully teach the class. Also an effective home Bible class
feeds new converts into local Bible teaching churches.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Preparation of the Teacher</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One cannot teach a home Bible class without initiative
and incentive. This manual may be a bit dry to some without having seen the
demonstration of the first session, the Old Testament “walk through.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For your personal study, read the manual through at one
sitting. Do this for several days. Then, study by lesson very thoroughly,
writing down questions that come to mind. Learn the material very well being
able to summarize at any given point. Chew and digest it until the material is
your own. Adapt it to your style of presentation. Remember, nothing is new
under the sun, except the Word of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Practice the Old and New Testament “walk through” in your
own home. For example, you could teach it to your children in family devotions,
or to your Sunday School class. Some teach the entire class to believers first,
getting it well in hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A Relaxed Mental Attitude:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If one does not thoroughly prepare, he will be afraid of
failure and lack self-confidence. He also needs to be in fellowship with the
Lord, having no mental attitude sins and be confident that the promises of God
will carry him through. After all, the battle is the Lord’s, and if “God be for
us, who can be against us?”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mechanics of the first class session (from teacher’s
preparation standpoint at the actual class):</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Square with the class. Mention to them that this is not
church, but is a factual Bible class. Assure them that you have no ulterior
motives, that it is simply a class to acquaint them with the teachings of the
Bible. Loosen up and loosen them up. Show them you enjoy teaching the Bible.
They didn’t come for a funeral or a burial. It is up to them to act upon the
teachings. They should leave a class session having enjoyed the class.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Tell them that this is not a catechism class in which
they will be asked (or invited) to join a church or sign a card at the last
session. Do not bring up finances. Indicate that no one will be embarrassed,
high pressured, or put on the spot. No one will be put under any obligation. In
certain classes, at the discretion of the teacher, prayer may not be advisable
either before or after the class session. Some unsaved people are spooked by
prayer, atheistic people are often present and so in the first sessions of the
class we usually do not pray. Much prayer is exercised before the class in our
study and afterwards, but not during the class. Prayer may come naturally about
the fourth session.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Remember, at all times you are giving the Gospel to the
lost. Therefore, you have to have the lost at the class. You can’t evangelize
the evangelized. The Gospel is not failing for lack of power, but because of a
lack of audience. Consequently, some may “light up” during the class, that is
his business (or hers). The issue is the Gospel not how he comes dressed to
class or how he acts while he is there.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mention the duration of the class. Possibly no one would
come back if you said, “Well, we’re not sure how long this series of classes
will go, maybe three or four years.” Mention that the class will consist of 12
sessions, preferably starting the second week in September and going through
the second week in December, or likewise in the spring.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>After you finish session #1, challenge them to teach the
Old Testament “walk through” to Grandma. This is a different way of getting
them to “think through” what they have learned. Leave quite quickly after the
class after convincing them they ought to bring friends to the next session.
With you gone (after first session) they can make plans to bring others and
enthusiastically share with each other how they enjoyed the class (which they
may not do, so much, with you present). Of, if you wish you can stay around if
they have a lot of questions. It is up to the individual class.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Involve the class in participation. These classes are a
combination of lecture and discussion. When you have taught them something, see
by various methods if they caught it straight.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Adaption of the suggestions in this manual (as far as
method) is very important. It is very important to understand that you do not
need a fantastic personality to teach these classes. Personality is helpful,
but character is what really counts. As a layman (and this manual is geared for
lay people) you may want to sit in on two or three entire classes before you
teach (if your pastor is teaching it in your area). Claim the exceeding
abundance of His Word, believe Him to do what He has promised.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>How to Establish the Class</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This will include finding the right host and hostess who
have a home that can be effectively used for outreach in their neighborhood.
Usually it will be up to the teacher of the potential class to find the right
home, whether he (the teacher) be pastor, missionary, or lay person. Now some
principles in establishing the class.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Use the Faith Principle:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If you have caught the vision of a Bible class, there is
a home open in the community; believe this by faith. Romans 14:23b “...for
whatsoever is not of faith is sin. Hebrews 11:6 “But without faith it is
impossible to please Him; for he that cometh to God must believe that He is,
and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Illustration: When the author was in college in the state
of single bliss without any suitable prospects, an alert college professor gave
several principles which eventually led to the Lord’s choice for a wife.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>I was asked if it was the will of the Lord for me to
eventually be married. The answer was “yes.” Now, is it the will of the Lord
for you to present the Gospel to the lost? Yes. Then is it His will for you to
have a class as a means of accomplishing this? If the answer is “yes” then....</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There must be a home where you can teach a class, where
people can meet who desire Gospel information. The analogy here is that just as
there is a marriage partner who is now living, so there must be a place to hold
the class.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Therefore, pray that the Lord might lead the man to his
wife to-be and the teacher to his class, by faith, to make the potential into
the actual. It works in getting a wife and no doubt it works in getting set up
in the right home for a class. So claim the promises of God. It is always His
will to publish the Word of Truth.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Put a List of Potential Homes Down:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Unsaved host and hostess who have a respect for the
Bible. Saved people who desire to grow in the Lord. Pray diligently concerning
these homes. Every time you drive by a prospective home pray that entrance
might be given.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Demonstrate the “Walk Through” to them in private in a
pre-session relaxed atmosphere. Explain thoroughly to the prospective host and
hostess what is involved in the class and the reason for having it. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Duration of the class, refreshments, and how they are to
get their friends out. Do not bring up finances unless they ask a question in
this regard. Hear them out in their fears and questions. If a pastor, explain
the relation of this class to your church. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Explain whether the class is to be for adults only or
whole family classes. In populated areas, one has better results in adult only
classes. However, in farm areas, baby sitters are not readily available.
Usually someone can take the children to the basement and with some prior
preparation can make the best of the hour or so that they supervise the
children. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Share how the living room should be set up and discuss
how many people to expect. Trust the Lord in all of this to sense His leading. Is
this the home?</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Principle of Switching Homes:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When you first start in a community; you may have to
start in a home that is a very fine, mature Christian home (with unsaved
friends). But as soon as possible switch to a non-church related home. The
problem here is that the new home will have new faces attending, who have not
been in on the first several sessions. Consequently in this type of switch, the
teacher needs to start out from scratch at session #1.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Size of the Class:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first session may be rather small with only four or
five attending. The hostess will have invited many, but few sometimes show up
at the initial session. However, the few that are there usually do a good job
of advertising the class and attendance sometimes doubles at the second
session.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Timing is important. In farm areas, classes can be best
started after the heavy farm work is over in the middle of November. Never
start a new class around Easter time unless unusual circumstances dictate.
Everyone goes in different directions in the summer months.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Allow the class to build for the first three sessions (if
staying in the same home) and then suggest that visitors not be encouraged to
come. It is confusing to them to come in the middle of the Davidic Covenant,
etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Most living rooms have a capacity of 10-30. Ascertain
whether the hostess has enough chairs. Perhaps she has a good meeting place in
a family room in the basement. If the first class session is to begin at 7:30,
come at 7:15 and “sweat it out” with the host and hostess. They may feel no one
is coming. Again use the faith principle.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A Chat on the Refreshments:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Agree on refreshments to be provided. Obviously, light
refreshments are the answer - coffee, water, cookies. This can be provided by
the hostess for the first three sessions, then the responsibility can be passed
around. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>On occasion, the last session could include some special
refreshments such as home-made ice-cream. How the refreshments are to be
handled at the end of the class requires some forethought. If wrongly handled,
people will get off the thought of what has been studied and ask non-related
controversial questions, or start discussing secular subjects. The food should
be brought to the class while they remain seated. Do not serve buffet style.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sometimes if the refreshments are too fancy, they will
get off the main subject onto food. If the atmosphere centers around the Word
of God from beginning to end, the class will have a much better impact.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Settling on the Day and Discussing Conflicts:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Monday, Tuesday, Thursday from 7:30 to 9:00 p.m. Friday
for folks over 50-60. Usually they are more home bodies and are not attending
athletic activities. Discuss what to do when a real conflict arises (some
special event that involves a majority of the class).</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Successful Host and Hostess</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The successful hostess is a prepared hostess. The host
and hostess will be efficient because they have had all the angles shared with
them by the teacher. They know what to expect. She has everything under control
so she can greet the people as they come in.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The successful hostess is a relaxed hostess. We mention
the hostess more than the host, because at this point more of the
responsibility falls upon her. And so a relaxed mental attitude is important.
She has the ability to make everyone feel at home and be comfortably situated. She
should be genuinely enthusiastic and optimistic about Bible study. She should
be, therefore, not ashamed to promote her class and share this tremendous
opportunity with all. Her husband should be of the same mind, although a bit more
reserved. Remember, these are couple’s classes and men need to be invited also.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They should have natural, genuine promotional ability,
somewhat leaders, and organized. It helps to be a “likeable” couple, but not
gushy, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The successful hostess is able to take distractions
without being distracted. Cats, dogs, and other pets will likely make an
unexpected appearance. Agree on the handling of the telephone. See that
internal noise is kept to a minimum. Agree on answering the doorbell. Agree on
keeping the parking situation straight. How will late comers be handled without
undue commotion. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Assured host and hostess should be confident that the
class will succeed. They should consider becoming personally involved in the
lives of those who attend in the area of evangelism and edification.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Outline of The Course of Study</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This course of study covers one quarter or 13 weeks.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sessions 10 -
12. Survey of Romans 1-8: Sin, salvation, Christian life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Session 13.
Optional session on death and contemporary history.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Session 1 - The Old Testament Walk Through</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Thought Conditioner </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>No doubt the sober group of men and women before you have
thought many things throughout the day. Now, we want to get them to think Old
Testament.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Stretch up an imaginary clothes line in the living room
holding it up with two imaginary poles at either end. The one pole signifies
God in eternity past and the other God in eternity future. This is God’s
clothes line of Old Testament history. The Bible gives history and its
interpretation from God’s viewpoint. Dramatize this clothes line.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Stress that this is chronological. Then, begin with Moses
and ask the class to name a person or event found in the Old Testament. This
encourages class participation and gets them thinking Old Testament in a
systematic way. If the class is very shy and illiterate concerning the Bible,
prepare beforehand “clothes” with 20 names or Old Testament events on them and
distribute them at this time. Then ask for the “clothes” back one at a time,
pinning them upon a “real” clothes line of string and two poles.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Getting back to Moses...when they suggest someone
verbally, for example, Saul, ask them (and the class) if Saul is to be placed
chronologically before or after Moses. Of course, it would be after. Keep on
doing this until you have covered the best known points from Adam to Nehemiah.
Hang up each name or event as they are given on the clothes line of history.
Keep it moving and lively. Relax them. A few laughs won’t hurt.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This will give them a composite picture of the people and
events of the Old Testament in survey fashion and prepare them for the second
phase of the first session.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><img width=500 height=270
src="Evangelistic%20Home%20Bible%20Class%20Manual1.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Dividing the Living Room into a Map of Palestine</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is actually the attention getter of the entire class
and generates amazing enthusiasm if well executed. Although this second phase
is very difficult to put down on paper, it is possible to learn this phase
without seeing an actual demonstration. At this point the class will generally
loosen up, relax and really begin to enjoy the class.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first approach: Ask the hostess if you can divide her
living room into a map of Palestine. Of course, she will reply “yes.” To the
rest of the class this is totally unexpected. Many of the class will have had a
preconceived notion what a “Bible class” is. They expected a podium, a Bible,
and a lecture. However, they are caught off guard...first a clothes line of
history and now a living room being divided into a map of Palestine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The second approach: Have two regular maps along, one
showing the Palestine area and one covering the larger area from Ur of the
Chaldees, Haran, etc. Orient the class from these.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The third approach: Now relate the people to geographical
locations in Palestine. For example, John is sitting in the southern end of the
living room. He would be in Beersheba. Clarabelle sitting in the ‘north, is in
Dan. They are 183 miles apart. If several are sitting along the west wall, they
are relaxing in the Mediterranean Sea which is a little difficult without
getting wet. Those in the southwest part of the room would be in Egypt, in the
east at the Jordan River, and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Take your time laying out the living room map. If three
men are sitting in the Jordan River area, assign one to the Sea of Galilee,
another to the Dead Sea, the remaining one to the Jordan River. This may seem
like kindergarten stuff, but adults enjoy it immensely.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Use humor in laying out the living room map. Usually
there are quite a few laughs which come naturally in this phase. For example,
Sam is sitting in the Dead Sea area and George is in the Red Sea area. An off
the cuff remark to Sam could be, “Sam, would you rather be Dead than Red?” This
type of remark will be humorous to them if they are relaxing properly.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Indicate to the class that they approximate the location
of these geographical areas. Obviously living rooms vary and the number of
individuals will vary from class to class. The ideal living room is longer from
north to south than east to west, because Palestine is. Often we switch the
directions around to better suit the living room. When this is done, the top of
the living room is north, regardless of the actual direction.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fourth approach: Now tell the class to watch the
symbols you make with your hands and arms. They are standardized and help the
class learn the chronological highlights of the Old Testament. Again, these
symbols are very difficult to put on paper. Thus, you may not appreciate this
session fully without seeing a live demonstration. Remember, we are still in
the second phase of session one.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Chronological Walk Through of the Old Testament</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The actual walk through begins with Abraham in Ur of the
Chaldees. However, here it may be well to fill in briefly the section from
Creation to Abraham. No dramatizing is included in this section. Be sure to
keep on the main track. That is, don’t get side-tracked on a discussion
concerning Creation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>From Creation to Abraham: </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God in eternity past created the heavens and the earth.
Gen. 1-2. Creation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Fall occurs in Gen. 3. Stress knowing chapter content
through knowing chapter titles. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Cain murders Abel. Gen. 4.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>World destroyed through the Flood. Gen. 6-8.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Inserted in Genesis 5 and 10 are genealogies. These are
very important for many reasons. Among them, it protects the future virgin
birth.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Promise of the rainbow. Gen. 9. Capital punishment also. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The tower of Babel was built. Gen. 11. Scattering.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>From Abraham to Joseph. The Old Testament Walk Through
begins here.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Abraham was chosen by God to father many nations. Gen.
11-12. (Point to Ur and pinpoint the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers with both
hands pointing straight to Ur and index fingers extended.)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He was born in Ur of the Chaldees. Then the teacher can
say, “Now for introduction time, where were you folks born? Let’s go around the
room and find out.” Take about ten minutes to do this, chatting with each
individual about their birthplace. Some of the men will for the first time
participate. This helps greatly to break the ice. After this is done, then repeat
the question, “Now, where was Abram born? Ur? Is that in Canaan? It isn’t?”
This is an example of the bantering that goes on.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>So, four leave Ur. They are always in this order -
Abraham, Sarah, Terah and Lot. (Hold up four fingers of the right hand, number
them off as you say them.)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Abraham, Sarah, Terah and Lot arrive in Haran. Call in
“barren” Haran for Haran means barren. (Since it’s hard to keep Abraham
straight from Abram, it’s better just to stick with Abraham.) Abraham stays at
Haran 20-30 years and becomes very rich. Walk up to Haran as you take them
there and indicate where Haran is. Terah is left in Haran where he eventually
dies.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>So Abraham, Sarah and Lot go into Canaan. They had to
travel via the fertile crescent. (Indicate Canaan with long sweeping motions.) Abraham
entered into a covenant with God. God promised him land, seed and blessing. (Use
three fingers to emphasize these.)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Abraham had two sons, “I” and “I”, Ishmael and Isaac.
Here, 14 years are covered very quickly. (Hold up two fingers to indicate these
two.) Eventually you’ll only have to hold up the fingers when you review and
they will say Ishmael and Isaac.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Isaac had two sons, “J” and “E”, Jacob and Esau. (Hold up
two fingers again.)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jacob had a whole lot of sons, 12 boys, (10 fingers then
2) and one girl (lone finger). “Anybody know her name? Right, Dinah. Who’s in
the kitchen with Dinah?” We have worked up chronologically to Gen. 34.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is very important at this point to review. Move
quickly back to southeast Canaan and point as you did before at Ur and ask them
what you have taught them, using the appropriate symbols with the hands. Thus,
they begin to participate. As you hold up four fingers ask them to name the
four that left Ur, helping them slightly. Then keep on going to Haran, then
down into Canaan, I and I, J and E and then Jacob and his large family. A few
won’t be participating, but don’t let them bother you.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>From Joseph to Moses (Genesis 37-Exodus 2)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jacob’s youngest son was little Benjamin. (Hold up your little
finger.) His next oldest was Joseph. (Hold up the next finger.) Joseph was sold
into slavery. First stop was Potiphar’s house. This is in Egypt. Remember by
“pot-of-fur.” Mention Joseph’s dream (butler-baker), a few events and then his
death. Note the bones of Joseph in Gen. 50.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Slavery is the order of the day in Egypt. Jacob and
Joseph’s 11 brothers moved to Egypt. In 430 years, from them developed 2.5 million
Israelites. This was 400 years of slavery with 30 years of prosperity while
Joseph still lived. (Make whipping motions to symbolize slavery.)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Fill in some details but don’t get bogged down. There may
be questions, so answer them briefly then move on. If a well-informed believer
is in the class, he may bring up minute points which waste time. The purpose of
this class is to reach the lost. Remember this.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>From Moses to Joshua: (Exodus through Deuteronomy)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Towards the end of the 400 years, a mighty deliverer
named Moses arose. (Facing Egypt, hold up hands high and outstretched.) He led
the children of Israel out of Egypt after ten plagues. (Hold up hands
indicating ten, moving across the Red Sea area.) They took a sharp right turn
and went down to Mt. Sinai. We are now at Exodus 20. This indicates to them
that we are making progress chronologically.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is well to review here by going back to Abraham in Ur
of the Chaldees. Let them call out the names and places. Move again through Ur,
Haran, Canaan, I &amp; I, J &amp; E, Jacob and his family, Joseph, Egypt,
slavery, Moses, ten plagues, crossing the Red Sea, and then end up again at Mt.
Sinai.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At Mt. Sinai two things were given: The law was given.
Ask the question, “Can anyone name some of the ten commandments?” They can a
few. Then ask, “How many of you have kept all of the ten commandments perfectly
from the day of your birth?” No one raises his hand (usually). Then ask, “How come
God gave a bunch of laws no one could keep perfectly?” Don’t wait for an answer
to this question, just keep moving.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pattern for the tabernacle was outlined. Then Moses
led the Israelites to Kadesh-barnea, an oasis in the wilderness, and twelve
spies were sent into the land. (Indicate Kadesh and use your hands to show the
spies going into the land.) Ten said it couldn’t be taken, two said it could.
The majority is always right isn’t it? Yes? No, definitely not. The question
concerning the law and this question are designed to plop seed plots into the
mind. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>So, the Israelites had to wander 40 years in the
wilderness until Moses was about to die but before he died, he preached five
messages which are in the book of Deuteronomy. (Make circular motions with the
hands to indicate wandering in the wilderness, then Moses about to die bow
head) and preaches five messages (hands outstretched). Deut. 1-3 1st message, Deut.
4-11 2nd message, Deut. 12-27 3rd message, Deut. 28-30 4th message, and Deut.
31 5th message.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Then General Joshua, a mighty five star general, takes
his place. (Be standing in the vicinity of the Jordan River, ready to cross,
arms outstretched.) At this point review again, going back to Abraham in Ur and
bringing them up through the ranks to Joshua.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>From Joshua to Anarchy (Book of Joshua)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Joshua led them across the Jordan at flood time. (Downward
slashing of the hands indicating crossing.) Right squarely in their way in the
middle of Canaan was in a sense the capitol of Canaan, Jericho. Dramatize by
pretending to be Jerichoites standing on the walls looking eastward. They saw
this huge hoard coming. Then imagine the intense interest when they march
around once the first day and so on until the place is conquered. Do you think
it made into the Jericho Times the early part of the week?</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Next, Ai - “Can you spell that? No you are pronouncing
it. I want you to spell it.” Keep it lively. Disobedience caused defeat. Achan
had disobeyed God in taking three things from Jericho. One can never enjoy the
fruit of disobedience. Then move on, don’t get preachy here.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Finally Ai is captured. “How did you say you spelled Ai?”
This banter might not sound funny written down, but it is needed to keep things
lively. Capture of Jericho, Ai and then finally victories in the region of
Gibeon resulted in a wedge separating the north of Canaan from the south of
Canaan. This was excellent military strategy.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Then Joshua takes his soldiers and conquers the south.
(Move into this area of the living room and make punching movements towards the
floor.) Then he goes back to Gilgal, pulls his troops together, and goes up and
fights the north. He wins, but not completely. (Again move up into the northern
part of the room and make similar punching motions.)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Then the land is divided up among the rest of the tribes.
Remember that Reuben, Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh had already chosen
their land on the east side of Jordan. (Move hands together in parallel fashion
to illustrate division of the land). Don’t get hung up here on the sons of
Joseph. The very simple explanation of this is that Reuben lost the double
portion to Joseph, thus his two sons became tribes.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Anarchy (Book of Judges)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Following division of the land, there was anarchy in
Israel. Judges ruled over Israel at this time. (Illustrate this 400 year period
by having the hands chop the air to show the ups and downs of this period.) Key
Statement: The last judge and the first prophet was Samuel. Again, review from
Ur of the Chaldees to the present. Keep it moving. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>From Samuel to the Silent Period (I Samuel, 2 Samuel, I
Kings, 2 Kings, Ezra, Nehemiah): </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Samuel, the last judge and the first prophet, anoints the
first king of Israel, Saul. (Hold up little finger of left hand to symbolize
Samuel and then for Saul hold up the little finger of the right hand). </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Saul - 1 Samuel (little finger) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>David - 2 Samuel (second finger) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Solomon - 1 Kings (third finger) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Split - 2 Kings (make hands bounce, wide apart)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At Solomon’s death the kingdom splits over taxes. As you
illustrate the split say “Explosion, Jerry-bomb ‘north’ and Rehoboam ‘south’.”
Jerry-bomb stands for Jeroboam who ruled over the ten northern tribes, Rehoboam
over the two southern tribes, Benjamin and Judah. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ten tribes in the north go into captivity in Assyria 250
years after the above split in 722 BC. (Indicate with one hand the location of
Assyria.) Two tribes in the south, Benjamin and Judah, become captives of
Babylon 150 years after the ten northern tribes are captured. They are there
for 70 years. (Indicate the location of Babylon, in the direction of Ur).</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ezra and Nehemiah brought part of the two southern tribes
back to Canaan. (Also Zerubbabel) Some stayed in Babylon. (Show with two
up-raised fingers, then symbolize with a few motions the rebuilding of the
walls and temple.)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Then the Old Testament closes. (Make a motion with the
hands as if closing a book). Note then that although the books of Ezra and
Nehemiah are located in the front part of the Old Testament, chronologically,
they are at the very end of the Old Testament period.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Silent Period.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Four hundred years passed between the closing of the Old
Testament and the birth of Christ. During this time, Alexander the Great
conquered the world, constructed the Koine Greek language and taught it to all
conquered peoples. Thus, the Greek text. (Illustrate 400 years by putting palms
of hands together and then moving them apart as if measuring a fish, then rock
arms in cradle fashion to illustrate birth of Christ.)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Now review from Samuel to the end of this section several
times. Then give them the silent test. Go from Abraham to the birth of Christ
using symbols only. Ask them to follow along under their breath and see how
easily it is to think through the Old Testament. To see this done is
fascinating. Most will be able to follow along easily. You may ask them at
several places what is being motioned to see if they are following you.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This much material is easily taught in an hour. Not all
will get it perfectly, but will get enough to desire to come back next week.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Chronological Order of the Old Testament Books</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It might appear that we show the people excessive
material the first night. Actually we do not. It again must be demonstrated by
an experienced teacher to be appreciated if you are in the state of being
“sold” on it.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Now, time only moves chronologically in 11 Old Testament
books. They are: Genesis, Exodus, Numbers, Joshua, Judges, 1 &amp; 2 Samuel, 1
&amp; 2 Kings, Ezra and Nehemiah. For your own study break them down in this
way:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Genesis:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Job is in this period. Chronologically it goes from the
beginning of Creation to Joseph in Egypt. In this class we are primarily
interested from Ur to Haran to Canaan to Egypt. (Swing arm from Ur through
these countries to Egypt and have the people say “Genesis.”)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Exodus:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Exodus - birth of Moses to giving of the law. (Arm swings
from Egypt to Sinai, people say “Exodus.”) When they exit out of Egypt, Exodus
is rapidly unfolding.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Leviticus - same time as Exodus and details the Mosaic
Law.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Numbers - Wandering of the children of Israel. (Hand and
arm rotates in circles in the wilderness area of the living room.)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Deuteronomy - Chronologically is the same time as
Numbers. Moses preaching his five messages on the plains of Moab.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Joshua - Under Joshua’s leadership, they enter the land;
book continues until the death of Joshua. (Hands parallel, make a path across
the wiggly Jordan River into the land.)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Judges - Anarchy during which judges are raised up to
deliver the people from lawlessness and sin. (Hands chop the air to illustrate
the ups and downs of this period.) Ruth fits here.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 Samuel through Nehemiah. (The entire prophetical period.)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 Samuel - The last judge and first prophet Samuel. (Hold
up little finger of right hand.)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>2 Samuel - David primarily in view here. Psalms generally
fits into this period. David wrote over half of the Psalms. Some of the other
writers are labeled, even a Psalm of Moses is included.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 Kings (Illustrated by third finger of right hand.)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Views Solomon’s reign, death and split of the kingdom.
Chronologically, Solomon’s three books are Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of
Solomon. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The divided kingdom had the following prophets: Isaiah,
Micah, Joel, Jonah, Amos, Hosea.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>2 Kings - This book continues the chronological record
through the Assyrian and Babylonian captivities. (Illustrate by index finger.)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 &amp; 2 Chronicles look at the same period at 1 &amp; 2
Kings. However, Chronicles looks at that period from the priestly standpoint
and Kings from the political viewpoint.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>After the northern ten tribes were captured by Assyria,
the following prophets ministered to the southern kingdom: Jeremiah, Habakkuk,
Zephaniah, Nahum (Jeremiah wrote Lamentations). </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Babylonian captivity had three prophets: Obadiah,
Ezekiel, Daniel.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ezra and Nehemiah - The period after the 70-year
Babylonian captivity. Esther is here also. (During Persian period.) (Hold up
two fingers for this point.)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The three last books of the Old Testament have the names
of the restoration prophets: Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Pre-Captivity Prophets – Samuel and all other prophets
except those in the Babylonian Captivity and Post-Captivity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Babylonian Captivity Prophets - Obadiah, Ezekiel, Daniel</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Post-Captivity Prophets - Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><img width=550 height=340
src="Evangelistic%20Home%20Bible%20Class%20Manual3.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Do not confuse the class by bringing in all of the above
information. Rather walk through the 11 chronological books using the symbols.
If this seems too much material to cover in one evening, then use two periods.
This systematic approach will be very helpful to get facts upon which to base
the Gospel in Session 2.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Session 2 - The Abrahamic Covenant</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Suggestions for teaching these lessons:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Try to not make these lessons a lecture type study alone.
Continue to keep the class involved by asking questions and reviewing what
already has been learned. Give and take, let them express themselves. After all
“greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world,” Be sure as a
representative of God, that you not only have your material well in hand, but
that you are relaxed and confident. Good classes have quite a few laughs.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Classes will fail with a lazy or ignorant Bible teacher.
The secret of succeeding in these classes is preparation and study often
involves blood, sweat and tears. The teacher must also thoroughly understand
the biblical technique of staying in fellowship. It is best not to use visible
notes, as many of the people in the class take offense at notes. Perhaps you
can use the margins of your Bible.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If you are the type that waits until the last minute to
prepare and then have a wee word of prayer, forget about teaching home Bible
classes. It would be an insult to the honor and glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Often teachers have prepared a whole year in advance before teaching, and they
have been rewarded with large, unbelievably eager classes. That first class is
important in a community. It must not flop! Happy teaching! It is the greatest
calling on earth. Remember too, every layman is in full time Christian service.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Pointers in teaching the second session:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Begin by thoroughly reviewing session one, phase two, the
Old Testament walk through. Stop and spend some time in the sticky places. See
that the visitors enjoy themselves. And remember that some who were there for
the first session did not get everything down pat either.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>After review, start with Genesis 12 and read the first
three verses. Be sure to explain the flash-back of these three verses compared
with Genesis 11:31-32. Then trace the highpoints of Abraham’s life ending with
Genesis 15:6. Pace your study so that you are not rushed with Genesis 15:6.
This is the heart of the second session. At least 15-20 minutes ought to be
spent on this verse alone. If you are not familiar with the Abrahamic,
Palestinian, Davidic, and New Covenants, it would be advisable to secure Dr. J.
Dwight Pentecost’s book, “Things to Come” at your nearest Christian book store.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Developing the Abrahamic Covenant - Part 1 (Covered in 2
sessions.)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Introduction: The first eleven chapters of the Bible
cover many, many years. Actually these chapters are the introduction to the Old
Testament. But suddenly in chapter 12, rapid chronology comes to a skidding
halt. <u>One human family</u> is picked out and described in great detail. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The three most important verses in all the Word of God
are found in Genesis 12:1-3. This may sound like a very rash statement, but
take it by faith for the time being. Here, Abraham, is promised three things:
land, seed, and blessing. This foundational promise gives us the theme of the
entire Bible and everything is related to it.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The chart: The chart below pictures the foundational
Abrahamic Covenant and shows the relationship of the three other covenants. The
basic Abrahamic Covenant is constantly repeated and explained in the Bible. The
land promises are amplified in the Palestinian Covenant. The seed promises are
amplified in the Davidic Covenant. The blessing promises are amplified in the
New Covenant.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><img width=500 height=310
src="Evangelistic%20Home%20Bible%20Class%20Manual4.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Abrahamic Covenant is found in the conversation
between God and Abraham in Genesis 12, 13, 15, 17 and 22. It is a clear text.
However, and this is very important, one’s interpretation of this covenant
affects his theology, especially in the areas of eschatology and soteriology.
Consequently, there are four major points to stress as far as the nature of
this covenant.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>This
covenant is to be interpreted literally. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>This
covenant is eternal in its expanse. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>This
covenant is unconditional on Abraham’s part. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>This
covenant is made with the nation Israel, that is with Abraham and his
descendants not Gentiles.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Thus, the above four, plus land, seed and blessing need
to grip us. Also, as a good background for teaching the Abrahamic Covenant,
study such New Testament passages as Hebrews 6:13-20, Galatians 3:13-18 and
Romans 4:1-5. Note that the blessing of Abraham is to come upon the Gentiles
also. Thus, this class follows the theme of “promise” throughout its entire
scope of the Bible.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Exposition of the Abrahamic Covenant: At this point,
stress the need for Bibles and notebooks. Many of the class will already be
taking notes. Some will have small print Bibles and several versions will be
present. Perhaps at this point, you may want to plant the seed in suggesting
them to get a good study Bible. We recommend the Scofield Reference Bible. It
is not, of course, the only study Bible, and its notes are not inspired. Also,
tell them how to secure these Bibles, the cost, where to purchase them and so
on. It seems best if all have the King James Version. Of course, any
translation or version is welcome if reliable. However, if one has a paraphrase
he often gets lost trying to follow along.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Genesis 12:2-3: “I will make of thee a great nation, and
I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and I will bless them that bless
thee, and curse him that curseth thee; and in thee shall all families of the
earth be blessed.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Comment: These verses form the seed-plot for the entire
Word of God and for the nation Israel. God’s dealing with the covenant people
Israel begins here, thus, these verses are introductory and should be
considered very important.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are dealing with foundations. An illustration of this
is found in the builder’s trade. Sometimes it takes as long to drive the
pilings and prepare the foundation for a 50-story skyscraper as it does to
construct the tower superstructure. It is important that the right foundation
is laid in the Bible so that the superstructure (the other 65 books) does not
lean and topple. The Bible can be likened to a 66-story building with Genesis
as the foundation and Revelation as the penthouse. The architect that planned
the Empire State Building knew the importance of a level foundation. We are
told that if one side of the foundation had been one fourth inch lower, at 19
stories the whole structure would have toppled. Therefore, we must stress plumb
foundations biblically.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Note at least four things promised in Genesis 12:2-3.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“A great nation.”
What does a nation need? People and land. So indicated here is land and an
increase into a numerous people. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Make thy name
great.” What made a name great in those days? Right! Progeny. This indicates
that Abraham will have children that will populate the land. The Old Testament uses
the term “seed” to indicate children. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“And I will
bless thee.” Abraham will be blessed materially and spiritually. He will be a
channel of blessing for untold millions. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“In thee shall
all families of the earth be blessed.” His appointment includes being the
possessor and dispenser of the blessing. Blessing and cursing of men to be
dependent entirely upon their attitude toward Abraham and to his descendants. “Curse”
means to not prosper, in contrast to “blessing” which means to prosper. The
blessing promised to Abraham was to unite the divided families of the world.
More will be said on this later.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Comment: Brainwash the people on land, seed, and
blessing. Note Genesis 12:5. Was this real land? Clods? Dust as we know it?
Real Estate? Really? You are sure now? OK. Remember when we get on the 40th
story that it was real land promised here not heaven. We are laying
foundations. Land is needed for a nation. A nation cannot exist without land
and the seed promise provides for the people to dwell in that land. Blessing
will come as a result.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Genesis 13:14-17. “And the Lord said unto Abram, after
that Lot was separated from him, lift up now thine eyes, and look from the
place where thou are northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward; for
all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it and to thy seed forever.
And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be
numbered. Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth
of it: for I will give it unto thee.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Now, when the Bible says land does it mean land? Are you
sure? Maybe it means strawberry Jello. That is, every time the word “land”
appears in the Bible it means just that, strawberry Jello. Why not? Stress here
the literal interpretation of the Bible in simple terms. When the Bible says
land it means land, real clods. Very important!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>By the way, how long was this land given to Abraham and
his seed? Look at Genesis 13:15. Forever? How long is that? 100 years? Until
Abraham told a lie? Had a fight with his wife? Or does forever mean forever?
Then Abraham and his descendants were promised real land forever. Will there be
clods in eternity then? Is there anything that talks about an eternal earth in
the Bible? Yes, it does in Revelation 21. Read it. Are you still sure when it
means land it means land?</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Up to this point, Abraham has been promised seed but not
too specifically. In Genesis 13, however, he is directly told that he is going
to have a group of descendants too large to count. Abraham is also told to walk
throughout the whole land. This was the land of Canaan. It is well to note that
it was given to him as a gift. Did Abraham deserve this gift? Great guy, this
man Abraham? Hard worker? No. Abraham didn’t deserve anything. It is
unconditionally given to him and his seed, lock, stock and barrel on the basis
of God's grace!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Names of Abraham and Sarah:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Abram meant “father of high and lofty places” or “father
of the winds.” When his name was lengthened to Abraham, it meant “father of
many nations.” Sarai meant “contentious or nagger.” Not too much hope there.
But later it was changed to Sarah which meant “princess.” Ladies, the Lord can
transform you too. (Laughter - at least there should be.) The meaning of names
was much more important in the Old Testament than today. Again, the grace of
God was extended to Abraham and his wife. A close study of this family will
convince the Bible student that they were very human and had their failures.
The Bible always gives an honest account.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Genesis 15:1-3 “After these things the word of the Lord
came unto Abram in a vision, saying, fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy
exceeding great reward. And Abram said, Lord God, what wilt thou give me seeing
I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus? And
Abram said, Behold to me thou hast given no seed; and, lo, one born in my house
is mine heir.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Comment: Get the drift? What is Abraham’s problem? He had
been promised land, seed, and blessing. Looks like he is on the gravy train!
What is his problem?</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>No Kids! Remember how old Abraham and Sarah were when
they left Haran? He was 75 and she was 65, right? They were over the hill as
far as having children was concerned. Abraham almost seems to think that God
doesn’t know the facts of life. Abraham was smart enough to know that he could
not farm a ranch the size of Canaan without help. Actually the land and
blessing promises meant little or nothing without children. So he is concerned.
Would you be?</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Note also the phrases, “I am thy shield,” and “thy
exceeding great reward.” Now remember we interpret literally. This means,
therefore, that God was going to allow Himself to be beat into a shield and
mold a handle on it, So Abraham can run around with God held by a handle? Does
it? Well, the predicate nominative is used here. (Wax eloquent on literal
interpretation again.) Illustrate by using a door. Christ said, “I am the
door.” Does that mean He was a literal wooden door? No. It means that He is the
opening into heaven. Just so, “shield” means that “I am your protector” and
“great reward,” your paycheck, your security. Abraham was living in wild, open,
rough and barren country. Explain that words can be used in a figurative sense,
but underneath is a natural literal meaning. But, don’t complicate it.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Eliezer, according to custom, would inherit Abraham’s
goods since there was no child, So Abraham suggests this to God. God says “no.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Genesis 15:4-5 “And behold, the word of the Lord came
unto him saying, this shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out
of thine own bowels shall be thine heir. And he brought him forth abroad and
said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars if thou be able to number
them: and he said unto him, so shall thy seed be.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is rather frank, isn’t it? God is saying, “Abraham,
you don’t have to worry. I always carry out what I promise. You are going to
have children. Eliezer will not be your heir.” God thus reassures him. Then, he
is challenged to count the stars. This illustrates innumerable seed.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Now, layman, pastor, loosen up here. Act out Abraham
trying to count the stars. Loosen up your people and help them relax because
Genesis 15:6 is crucial. This verse will present the Gospel. And this issue
needs to be presented clearly. So where do we stand as we come to this verse?
Let’s just look back for a minute. The emphasis of no children has to be made
properly.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Do you get the picture her? Abraham is told he will have
children. But he doesn’t have any. He is too old. Absolutely impossible! What
is Abraham to believe? The clear promise of God! Will he believe it or won’t
he? Build this up, teachers; 15:6 is the climax verse for session two.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Gen. 15:6 “And he (Abraham) believed in the Lord; and He
(God) counted it to him for righteousness.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This last part of session two is very important. It is
helpful to illustrate this verse in many ways. It clearly presents salvation.
Perhaps you can develop it in this way. Deal first with “righteousness” then
with “believed” and last of all “counted.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Righteousness:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What is righteousness? In everyday language? Yes,
goodness. Like, “He is a good guy.” Now there are two types of goodness. The
first type of goodness is +R and the second is -R. One is absolute and the
other is relative. To develop this right will fill a much needed area. Most
people feel they are basically “good,” but the best good that man can crank out
is only human good with the source, the old sin nature.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Good guy illustration: Pick some men out of the class and
do this. “Let’s see, John here is good, better than Sam over there that spent
some time in Sing Song. But over here (pointing) is Joe. Joe is good even
better than John. He makes fruit cakes and gives them to under privileged
children. Now, what impression do you get? John is better than Sam, but Joe
actually takes the limelight as a good person. Really though, Sam in a sense is
good, John is good, and Joe is good. So there must be relative degrees of good.
But all are -R.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Now let’s compare goodness is an unusual way. “Sam is
good, John is good, Joe is good, God is good.” Can God be compared to Sam, John
and Joe? No! God definitely has a different kind of goodness than they do. God
has +R and man has -R.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Absolute-Relative Illustrations:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Music: Is there an absolute in music? Let’s say that Sam,
Joe and John go to Carnegie Hall. Now they are the backwoods boys from the
Grand Old Opry country. They walk into Carnegie Hall barefooted with straws
sticking out of their mouths and sit down with their hats on their heads! In
front of them are five cultured ladies, spangled and adorned. Out comes the
conductor in tails and the show begins. (Act this out!!) The three men nearly
die before it is all over. To them it isn’t good music! But the ladies thought
it was the finest. “This is really good music.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Now, what is good music? It depends with whom you are
conversing. It is a matter of taste.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Now, switch scenes to Grand Old Opry country. This is an
entirely different type of music than at the other setting. Our men are sitting
down, barefooted, hats on, chewing on a straw. Suddenly those five elegant
ladies come in and are seated on a bench in their evening gowns. Out come the
guitars and so on. (Act it out.) Our men say that this is great music. What do
you suppose the ladies are saying?</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Now is music appreciation relative or absolute? Relative,
of course, it is a matter of taste. (-R)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Art: Do the same with art in the Chicago Art Museum. Have
the same characters as above and use abstract art and Grandma Moses. Act it
out. Is art relative or an absolute. Still relative. (-R)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Automobiles: Sam has a Ford. John has a Dodge. Joe has a
Chevy. Sam thinks his Ford is a good car, Joe thinks his Chevy is a good car.
John thinks his Dodge is a good car. Good, good, good. Is this relative or
absolute goodness? Relative of course. (-R)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Now for the punch line. What kind of goodness does God
have? Absolute goodness. The +R kind. The kind I have to have to stand in God’s
(+R) presence.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Nickels: What kind of righteousness did God give to
Abraham when he believed? He gave him absolute (+R). That is the only kind of
goodness God has to give. Illustrate by pretending to hand out 10 nickels all
with the same minting date. Then ask each of the ten what date the nickel they
are holding has. They reply with the same answer. Why? That’s all I had to give
out. And when God gives His righteousness on the basis of believing, it has to
be absolute righteousness (+R). That is all He has to give out!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believing: (Still Genesis 15:6)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>How did Abraham get this +R? This verse says by
believing. What is involved in that? The word here means “amen.” It means I
lean upon what you say. I believe what you say is true. Illustrate by leaning
against a wall or sitting on a chair. (I trust the chair to hold me up, etc.)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believing can be illustrated by the Frenchman who walked
across Niagara on a tight rope. Then, he came back and asked a man standing
watching if he thought he could go across the same tight rope pushing an empty
wheel barrow for a balancing stick. The man indicated that he believed he
could. The Frenchman again was successful. This time he again approached the
same man and asked him if he believed he could push the wheel barrow across
with a man in it. The man indicated that he thought he could. He believed so.
Then the Frenchman said to the man, “All right buddy, jump in, you’re the man.”
You can imagine the reaction of the fellow. He may have jumped out of his skin
but not into this wheel barrow. This is an illustration of how NOT to believe.
This is head knowledge, not acted upon.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believing must be in the Lord Jesus Christ and must be
personal. Abraham had believed in the Lord back in Ur of the Chaldees. We see
this from the tense of the Hebrew verb which is perfect. It should be
translated, “and he had believed in the Lord....” The perfect tense indicates
an action that had already been completed in the past with continuing results.
Right here go into the issue of salvation using terms which will communicate.
Take nothing for granted. Remind them that the issue is Christ. It is Good News
that Christ died for our sin and now by faith on the basis of grace we are to
lean upon Him. Believe what He says is true. Illustrate that it is not by works
by turning to Romans 4.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Generally the word “sin” does not communicate with a
modern audience. This does not mean, however, that one needs to throw the word
out. It is a bonafide word. Their concept of the term is much different than
the Bible definition. Often their problem is human good. They believe
themselves fundamentally good even though they commit bad deeds occasionally.
They feel the bad is outweighed by the good.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>So here is a statement that often can be used to good
advantage. The Bible indicates that good people don’t go to heaven. And it
doesn’t necessarily follow through that if you are bad you are going to hell.
One does not go to heaven on the basis of how good or bad he is, but on the
basis of accepting Jesus Christ as Savior. And one does not go to hell on the
basis of being bad, but on the basis of having rejected Jesus Christ as Savior.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Counted:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When Abraham had believed in Ur of the Chaldees, it had
been counted (credited) to him absolute righteousness.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The term “counted” is a bookkeeping term. Abraham,
because of sin (Rom. 3:23) and human good (Isa. 64:6) was billions in debt to
God. He was on the minus side of the ledger. Although Jesus Christ had not died
historically on the cross, according to the doctrine of divine decrees (the
plan of God) Jesus Christ had already died in the mind of God upon the cross.
(Rev. 13:3, “...of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world” compared
with 1 Peter 1:19-20.)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For example: Here is Abraham in debt so far he can’t work
it out. So Christ pays the debt through the cross thus erasing the debt. Then,
He goes a step further and gives him divine resources. He credits him with
righteousness. So Abraham comes out forgiven of his debt plus credit in the
plus side.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Concluding illustration for session two:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Let’s say I am driving my car down a road and suddenly it
stops. I make an inspection and find I am out of gas. So I stand along the road
and try to stop different vehicles. Suddenly a man in a pickup truck stops,
jumps out and without a word opens up the hood of my car and begins to take out
the spark plugs and clean them. But I yell, at him, “I am out of gas.” Then he
continued to check the carburetor, the fuel pump, and the distributor. I keep
on yelling, “I am out of gas. I need gas.” “Hey!” But he keeps on fooling
around. Then he washes my car, polishes it with wax and cleans my windshield. I
keep on saying, “But, man, I need gas!” Finally he gets in his pickup and
drives away. My auto looks beautiful but it still will not run.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The point: I can work my head off to get to heaven. And,
most of the things I do will be good deeds. There was nothing wrong with what
the guy in the pickup did. It was just the fact that I had a basic need of gas.
Gas was the key. And just so, I need righteousness before I can get to heaven.
How do I get it? By working for it? By being a good boy so Christ can act like
a good time Charlie to me or be benevolent and jolly like Santa Claus to me?
No, by believing. But it matters what I believe. I must believe in the Lord
Jesus Christ who died on the cross for my sins. (Go into the plan of
salvation.)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Tell them to teach this lesson to grandma, also and to
come back next time and bring visitors.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Session 3 - The Abrahamic Covenant Continued</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Pointers in Teaching the Third Session:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The key is lively, alert, reviewing. Start on time. Note:
If people stay with you through the first three sessions, they will most likely
be faithful during the entire class. Visitors will, however, be confused if
they come after the third session. If they come, of course, they should be
welcomed.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Then walk through the Old Testament quickly using the
people in participation. Then open with a question like this: “Was Abraham a
Jew or, was he an Israelite? I thought he was a Babylonian. Maybe he was a
Hebrew. Is there any difference in terms?” Involve them, don’t lecture or
sermonize. Commend them on how much they have learned, if they have.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Again, review land, seed, and blessing. Explain that the
land promises of the Abrahamic Covenant are expanded and amplified in the
Palestinian Covenant, the seed promises (future children, not wheat) are
expanded and amplified in the Davidic Covenant, and the blessing promises are
likewise dealt with in the New Covenant. It is very important that this
foundational covenant be thoroughly understood.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Developing the Abrahamic Covenant - Part Two: </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Be sure to review Genesis 15:5 by asking questions.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Contextual background:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>With more advanced pupils in a class of this type,
sometimes the issue of when Abraham was saved will come up. Some will feel that
he was saved in Genesis 15:6. Others will feel he was saved back in Ur of the
Chaldees. So some background should be brought up as far as context. Actually,
Abraham was worried in Genesis 15. This is indicated by the first verse. He
indicates his further worry by trying to straighten out God on the facts of
life in the second verse.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>So, in Genesis 15:5, God reminds Abraham that he had
believed many years ago and had received righteousness credited to his account.
Now, just as Abraham had believed for salvation so he is to believe that God
can keep His promises to him now. Romans 8:32 states that “He that spared not
His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also
freely give us all things?”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>But he continues to worry by asking God in the eighth
verse, “...Whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?” So he is told to take
some animals and lay them out thus and so. Later on he goes into a deep sleep.
God then by grace, enacts the Abrahamic Covenant.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The cure for worry is outlined in this passage. The first
cure is found in verses one through seven, the promises of God. Abraham is to
believe them. The second cure is found in verses eight through eleven, to rest
upon the doctrines of the Word of God. Worry had gotten Abraham out of
fellowship and he needs to confess sin Biblically. (Animal offerings.) Then
from verse 12 on, the third cure for worry is offered, a knowledge of prophecy.
If I am not afraid of death, and life after death, it will cut down on the
nightmares of life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Romans 4 also follows this pattern. First it stresses
salvation by grace not works in verses 1-11. Then, on the basis of having
believed in the Lord for salvation, Abraham kept on believing that God could
fulfill His promises, verses 13-25 with special emphasis on verses 20-21.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Confirmation of the Covenant:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Abraham wanted a confirmation of this promise as it
transcended all human thinking. There were several ways to confirm a covenant
in those days. Two ways such ways were to exchange a bag of salt between the
two parties or to exchange sandals before witnesses.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>By the blood covenant. This blood covenant involved
killing animals, splitting them, forming a corridor between the two halves and
then the two parties would walk through the corridor together. Should one party
fail in his obligation, he must be killed even as the animals were killed. The
more animals the richer the parties involved and the more serious the contract.
A heifer - sin offering, a she goat - reconciliation offering, a ram -
propitiation offering, a turtle dove - deity of Christ, a young pigeon – the resurrected
humanity of Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What happened when Abraham fell into a deep sleep? He
dreamed that there would be a 400 year period in which Israel would not dwell
in the promised land. They were to be afflicted by a foreign power (Egypt) but
were promised one day to be in the land. Then, symbolized by a flaming torch
(God) identified with a smoking stove (Abraham and his seed - Abraham asleep)
God moved alone between the slain animals. This signified that God assumed all
responsibility with Abraham and his seed being the receivers. God thus assumed
the responsibility for keeping the eternal covenant in effect.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God then extended the boundary line of the land involved.
It projects from the Nile River to the Euphrates River. Even various tribes
living in these geographical boundaries are mentioned.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Now if you have time (depends upon how much time you have
spent in review and moved quickly in doing it, not getting bogged down) narrate
quickly the folly of Genesis 16. Sarah had fallen for the old cliché, “God
helps those who help themselves.” And it brought nothing but heartache. The
whole Arab-Israel conflict begins right here in Genesis 16. Check out Genesis
16:12 to show the general behavior of the Arab.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Abraham loses his old name of Abram in Genesis 17. Father
of the winds is changed to father of many nations. And this was changed before
Isaac was born. Can you visualize Abraham going to town after his name was
changed and having people say, “Hi, Abram” and Abraham would say, “My name is
not Abram, it’s Abraham.” And they would look around and say, “Well, where’s
the kids?” For Abraham meant father of many, many children. His name must have
been a real crowd-stopper! Imagine! Abraham had to answer by faith. Ishmael was
the only one, and he was of the flesh.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>So God confirms again the Abrahamic covenant in Genesis 17:6-8,
and the sign (outward) of the covenant is levied, circumcision, Sarai
(contentious) was changed to Sarah (princess). From a nagger, she became a
princess in disposition by the grace of God. If any of you ladies have any
trouble here (and men do also) there is hope for you as there was for Sarah.
The intake of Bible doctrine changes our disposition.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 21, the child Isaac (laughter) is born as
promised. And it is a miracle because their combined ages total 190. Friction
again is seen in this chapter between Ishmael and Isaac which will not stop
until the Second Advent of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Then finally in Genesis 22, Isaac is offered on the
mountain that one day Christ died upon and the covenant is confirmed to Abraham
in Genesis 22:17-18. Abraham had grown in the Lord and was blessed exceedingly.
Abraham again quotes the promises in Genesis 24:7 and in Genesis 26 the
covenant is confirmed to Isaac, and then to Jacob in Genesis 28. Further
references through the Old Testament prove that their prosperity or disgrace
revolved around the promises made to Abraham. End by selling the next lesson, the
Palestinian Covenant’s uniqueness to the class. It will be a fascinating
lesson.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Systematically expounding these Scriptures from Genesis
15:18 on down will keep you on course. You will find unusual interest on the
part of your class in this lesson. Some of your class will be quite up to date
on what is happening in the Middle East, so be on your toes. We will deal with
this covenant by dealing with each of the Scriptures on the chart.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Pointers in Teaching: Sometimes the question is asked why
the Mosaic Covenant is not taught along with these other covenants. It is not
covered in this series for several reasons. The Mosaic covenant is temporary
and conditional, which is in sharp contrast to the unconditional and eternal
aspects of the four major covenants. However, it may be well to say that the
Mosaic covenant, like the Abrahamic covenant, was made with Israel and is to be
understood literally. It was fulfilled in Christ’s life and death and is too
exhaustive to be dealt with in this manual, as so much Scripture would have to
be covered.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Points in teaching the Palestinian Covenant: This is a
fascinating study, but don’t get bogged down in too much detail. Emphasize that
God promises literal land eternally and unconditionally as far as the title
deed is concerned. With events taking place in the Arab-Israeli world this
lesson can readily explain the present world conditions.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Genesis 15:18: This verse stresses the large amount of
land promised to Abraham and his descendants. The dimensions are much greater
than the 183 mile by 25-52 mile section from Dan to Beersheba and the
Mediterranean to Jordan River area. Has Israel ever dominated the larger area
completely in past history? No, not even in Solomon’s time. Stress this or you
may have problems later when someone may claim that the land promises have
already been fulfilled, and since they have, the land must refer to heaven. A
map brought to class will help.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Genesis 17:8: “And I will give unto thee, and thy seed
after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all of the land of Canaan,
for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.” Stress again the
everlasting ownership rights given to Israel. They were given the title deed
absolutely by God. It is theirs lock, stock and barrel. Is it theirs now? Do
they own Palestine NOW? What about Arabs still dwelling in parts of the land
given to the Jews by God. Is it fair for the Jews to drive these Arabs out?
Comment: Don’t ask this question unless you feel you can handle it.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Deuteronomy 28-30: The Palestinian Covenant is actually
stated in Deuteronomy 30:1-8. But Deuteronomy 28-29 give tremendous background
and build-up to this covenant. Now remember that these covenants were what?
That is right, literal, unconditional and eternal. Begin to read Deuteronomy 28:1-2,
emphasize the word “if.” Don’t comment. Then note the “blesseds.” Then read Deuteronomy
28:13 emphasizing again the word “if.” Then likewise with Deuteronomy 28:15 and
note the word “cursed.” Now, didn’t I say that the four covenants are
unconditional? Yes! But this “if” word doesn’t look very unconditional to me.
“If” would mean that there is a condition attached! What is going on? If, if,
if, if! Let them discuss it here, but if possible, don’t give the solution yet.
Then read Deuteronomy 28:58. It has another “if” in it.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Then note Deuteronomy 28:62: “And ye shall be left few in
number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because thou
wouldst not obey the voice of the Lord thy God.” Now we come to the key
illustration which actually unlocks the whole secret of the Palestinian
Covenant. What we will illustrate is this: Israel’s ownership of the land is
unconditional and eternal, but their possession of it, that is their living on
the land and enjoyment of it, is based on obedience! Get this clearly in mind.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Illustration: Use people in the class. Let’s say that
John here is wanting to buy Sam’s house. Finally a contract is drawn up that is
a bit unusual. Sam is going to give John the house lock, stock, and barrel
provided he can put something in fine print at the bottom of the contract with
his knowledge. Of course, John wants to know what the fine print reads.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“This house I sell completely to John Doe giving a clear
title entitling him to unconditional ownership. However, his possession of the
house, that is, living and enjoying its spacious luxury is conditional to
obedience to the following statement. John Doe must always own and drive a
Dodge. Obedience to this statement will guarantee that John and Mary Doe and
family can enjoy and live in the house they own.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Well, John and Mary look over the contract and since they
own a Dodge, they see no harm entering into the deal. After all, they are
getting the land and property free. They didn’t have to work a bit to get it.
It is only right that they comply with his wishes on this.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One day, several years later, their Dodge falls to
pieces. John and Mary had been enjoying their property and had forgotten the
fine print. So they went new car shopping. They found a Ford dealer would give
them a terrific deal, whereas the Dodge dealer wouldn’t do as well. Deep down
they wanted the Dodge and they knew that there were many benefits in owning
such a car. But instead, they bought the Ford. Coming home they drove it into
their driveway. Looks great!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>But, who would be driving past but Sam, the previous
owner. Suddenly, Sam jams on the brakes, runs up into the driveway and asks,
“Is that your car?” “Yep, just bought it; isn’t it a beauty?” But Sam informs
then that the house contract stipulates that you must own a Dodge. Why that’s
silly. I couldn’t get a good deal at the Dodge dealer.” And so it goes, but at
nightfall, John, Mary and the kids are out of the house with everything in
piles in the street in front of the house. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Finally John breaks down and takes the Ford and trades it
on a new Dodge, regardless of the cost involved. When he gets home with the
Dodge, Sam who has been keeping a watch on the place, congratulates him and
helps him move all the furniture right back into the house and again they enjoy
the home that was theirs as far as ownership is concerned.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The principle is this: Israel’s ownership of the land is
unconditional but possession and enjoyment of that land is based on obedience
to God’s grace plan. And ultimately Israel can only be obedient through
spiritual growth. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Now, at this point expound the unconditional qualities of
our so great salvation. We accept the package of salvation by believing in
Christ as our personal Savior. But to enjoy our salvation we must be obedient
to the Word of God as revealed in the techniques of the Christian walk. Note
Romans 11:26-27 in this regard.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Deut. 28:63-67. Note well this verse. If they were
disobedient, they were disbursed (scattered). Are the Jews scattered now? Yes.
How do they feel about the Gentile nations? Secure? Remember this was written
thousands of years ago. Tremendous interest is usually manifested here.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Deut. 29:12-13 This shows that the Palestinian Covenant
is tied into the Abrahamic Covenant. Deut. 30:1-8 Since the background has
already been given, question them through this text. What is the blessing in
verse 1? Obedience right! What is the cursing? Disobedience. Do they still own
the land? Unconditionally? Certainly! The main thing to stress in the
Palestinian Covenant proper is in verse 3. They are scattered now, but they
will be regathered. A regathering by God presupposes what on Israel’s side? Obedience.
And obedience presupposes what? Conversion. Now upon what basis is conversion
provided? The New Covenant.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ezekiel 37: This passage indicates that the regathering
begins in unbelief, but actually is not fulfilled until the Second Advent of
Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Very Important: Stress here the difference between the Rapture
of the Church and the Second Advent. The Rapture occurs at the end of the Church
Age, seven years before the Second Advent. The Rapture is Christ coming to the
clouds for His body, the Church as described in 1 Thessalonians 4:13ff. The
Second Advent occurs at the end of the Great Tribulation when He comes with His
saints and every eye shall see Him. Matthew 24:27-31, Rev. 1:9, etc. Many
Christian workers fail to make this distinction by just calling these future
events His second coming. However, there are two phases of His second coming, each
very distinctively different. Note well!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ez. 37:1-10: Read this passage through with very little
comment. Then without referring to the next verses (11 and following) ask them
to interpret this passage. (The divine commentary is found in 11 and
following.) This is a good time to give some further information on contextual
interpretation. Often the meaning of a passage is explained in surrounding
Scriptures. Always study the surrounding context.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ez. 37:11-14: Go slowly through this passage. Note the
14th verse, “I will put my Spirit within you.” Israel owns the land but cannot
possess it without being obedient. And she cannot be obedient without God’s
Spirit being put within and what is this? Conversion. What covenant provides
this? The New Covenant. Why can the New Covenant provide salvation through
belief in Jesus Christ? Because the Davidic Covenant amplifies and explains the
qualified seed, Jesus Christ. The details of the biblical jig-saw puzzle begin
to fit together. Now for the sake of time, you may have to stop at 37:14.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Isaiah 11 &amp; Ez. 11:16-21: These passages simply prove
that this regathering is complete at the Second Advent. Israel will see Him
whose hands they have pierced and be converted (indwelt and filled by the Holy
Spirit) as a nation in a day.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Daniel 2 &amp; 7: This gives the course of the Gentile
nations while Israel is scattered among them. (Usually not used because of a
lack of time.)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Give an inkling of the next lesson, encouraging them to
study 2 Samuel 7 with regard to the Davidic Covenant. Many will follow your
suggestion and have a real hunger for the Word by this time.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Session 5 - The Davidic Covenant</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Pointers in Teaching</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>About this time, you may be so enthusiastic in seeing the
response of the class that you don’t study as you should. And the Davidic
Covenant class may be a flop. This is the hardest to teach right, so get the
material well in hand. Review previous material by asking questions.
Trouble-shoot and see if any of the class members have gotten stuck in the mud
or lost in the fog.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Chronologically bring your class up to date. Use the Old
Testament walk through. The history continues on from Joshua and the
Palestinian Covenant (given by Moses before he died) through the conquering of
the land, its division, the 400 years of the Judges, the introduction of Kings
as rulers and on down to the reign of David approximately 1000 years before
Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is the Christmas Covenant which supplies the
qualified Savior through the virgin birth. The promises could not be fulfilled
without one qualified to do so. Hence, the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><img width=440 height=440
src="Evangelistic%20Home%20Bible%20Class%20Manual5.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Developing the Davidic Covenant</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Begin the development with Luke 1:26-37. State that not
even the well-known Christmas story can be understood without realizing the
importance of this great covenant. Go through this passage quickly, telling
them to look for three key words of the Davidic Covenant. They are “house,
kingdom, throne.” Then follow the Scriptures in the order given on the chart
above, expositing them.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some more background: David had been successful as King.
He had been a mighty warrior and now had peace with his enemies. David wanted
to build a temple to be a worship center extraordinaire. But through the
prophet Nathan, David was denied this privilege. But a promise was given to him
of much greater value. God promised David that his seed would rule the house of
Israel. The New Testament records the fact that Jesus Christ came from the seed
of David to fulfill that promise. Luke 1:32-33. Jesus Christ will return again
to rule on earth as the qualified Savior, being of the seed of Abraham, and
fulfilling the promise of rulership.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>2 Sam. 7 (Lead up to 2 Samuel 7:14 gradually):</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>2 Sam. 7:1-3. Right here you may want to lecture. But
don’t. Question them throughout the text. However, here are some conclusions: David
dwelt in a pretty fancy house and it bothered him that God dwelt in a ragged
tent. Nathan gave his immediate consent to build a temple for God. He gave too
hasty a judgment, however.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>2 Sam. 7:4-7: Nathan gets instructed from God that
evening and Nathan proves to be a man of God. David is not to build a temple
because: God had not lived in anything but a tent among His people and He was
satisfied with that arrangement. He had not commanded the building of a temple.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>2 Sam. 7:8-11: God has said in effect. “You cannot build
a house for me, but I will glorify myself by building a house for you and your
son (Solomon) will build that house for me.” Now remember, David, where you
came from! You are what you are by the grace of God! Note the term “sheepcote”
in the KJV. What is a sheepcote? Something like a horse blanket? Explain, at
times, outdated words such as this one. God is saying, “David I’m going to make
you a house.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>2 Samuel 7:12-16: Upon David’s death, Solomon ascended to
the throne of David and God defended his kingdom against the siege of Adonijah.
1 Kings 2:12. This was so that Solomon was able to testify, “The Lord hath
fulfilled His word that He spoke; for I have risen up in the stead of my father
David.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 Kings 8:20.  Solomon built the temple as the Lord said He
would. 1 Kings 5:19, 8:15ff. But in his old age Solomon sinned against the Lord
by idolatry. Punishment was meted out to his kingdom by being split at his
death. Ten tribes became Israel, two tribes became Judah. Yet, one part was
still preserved to the family for David’s sake, and that one part or tribe was
Judah. 1 Kings 11:9ff. Thus, the Lord punished Solomon with the rods of men,
but did not withdraw from His grace. This, in essence, is what this passage
teaches.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Note the use of the terms, house, kingdom and throne. House:
England has a ruling monarch from the house of Windsor. The term “house” means
a dynasty, a ruling monarch (posterity, family). Kingdom: A king must have a
kingdom. (Sphere of rule.) Throne: He must have a throne, the seat of
government. Thus, He (Jesus Christ, the seed of Abraham, David, Solomon) must
be a qualified Savior. Illustrate to a great degree this point. Here are some
suggestions. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Many people have claimed to be saviors. Don’t be too
specific here. There are, they say, many ways to get to heaven. “Just follow
me!” But only One has the credentials. He must have the right lineage. He must
be born of a virgin. He must be God as well as man. He must have victory over
death. Illustration: Because my wife and I have a joint checking account, my
wife qualifies to write checks on that account (provided there is capital
present). Illustration: My people recognize me as their pastor. Thus, they
expect me to mount the pulpit at our regular services and teach the Word.
Certain qualifications are necessary for this.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>David’s throne will be occupied by an eternal king. Note
the use of the word “forever” as it is used in these verses. God promised to
not withdraw His mercy (mercy is extended to man in his misery) from the seed
even when they went astray.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Disobedience in the Davidic family is to be visited with
chastisement, but the covenant will never be abrogated. Just so our salvation
which is built upon this covenant will never be severed, but to unfaithful
believers chastisement will be meted out. Our salvation is literal, eternal and
unconditional because it is built on covenants that are literal, eternal, and
unconditional. It is important to emphasize this.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Psalms 89:3-4, 34-36: “I have made a covenant with my
chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant. Thy seed will I establish forever,
and build up thy throne to all generations. Selah. My covenant will I not
break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips. Once have I sworn by my
holiness that I will not lie unto David. His seed shall endure forever, and His
throne as the sun before me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>So, you see, a seed was promised prophetically to occupy
the throne of David forever. The posterity of David could only last forever by
running out in a person who lives forever and of whose kingdom there would be
no end. The promise thus begins with Solomon and closes with the Lord Jesus
Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Isaiah 7:14. The qualified Christ had to be virgin born.
This passage is quoted in Matthew 1:23. If Jesus Christ was not virgin born He
was illegitimate, had an old sin nature and was mere man. Only the virgin birth
could qualify Him as being undiminished deity and true humanity, the God-man
who was sinless. The virgin birth is, of course, a miracle.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Isaiah 9:6-7. Here is further detail concerning the
qualified Savior. Here are some of His names. An analogy to this fact, Queen
Elizabeth II, a past monarch of England, had the proper name to execute her
duties. Incidentally the name, “The everlasting Father” is literally “Father of
eternity.” He (Jesus Christ) executed the plan of God so that we may have
eternal life. Note in verse 7 the three key words again. Government corresponds
to house and also kingdom and throne are mentioned.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Luke 1:26-37. We return again to this passage. Years
later when the house of David had fallen into decay, Jesus Christ was born of
the seed of David according to the flesh to raise up the throne of His father
David. Note Isaiah 11:1. So Christmas commemorates the birth of One who would
be the effective administrator of all eternity!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Illustration: Joseph was a genius at administration. At age
17, he was responsible for his father’s sheep and was administrator over his
brothers. His coat was not “a coat of many colors” according to the Hebrew
text, but a “long sleeved robe” which was his insignia of authority. The older
brothers had short sleeved robes. This is why they hated that coat so much. It
represented authority that they despised. When he was taken into Potiphar’s
house, he soon was administrating the household. So likewise he did when he was
in prison. He soon became prime minister of Egypt, second only to Pharaoh. But
Jesus Christ is the eternal administrator who will guide the affairs of all
eternity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Illustration: Moses was a genius of administration. He
showed this genius even before he was saved at the age of 39. One year later at
40 he chose to not enjoy the grandeur of Egypt and to identify himself with the
Israelites. Secular history indicates that he, as Pharaoh’s daughter’s adopted
child, would have been the greatest Pharaoh the world had ever known. Here was
a man who under the leadership of God could handle an assembly of 2.5 million
people. But a Man greater than Moses is here!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Illustration: Daniel was a man who was an administrative
genius also. He was second in the Persian kingdom (Dan. 6:1-3) and since this
was a world power and recognized by God as such, he was the second most
powerful man in the world. He was a man of God having an excellent spirit. He
was one of the original Wise Men who six hundred years later came to worship
the Christ child. But, Jesus Christ, the qualified One is greater than them
all.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Matthew 23:37-39. When Jesus Christ came as King to
announce that the kingdom was at hand, His own Jews received Him not; they
crucified Him. They killed the king. He, weeping over them said, “Behold your
house is left unto you desolate.” This is explained by such passages as Hosea
3:4: “For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and
without a prince, and without a sacrifice....” In other words, the Davidic
Covenant did not guarantee an actual ruler on the throne to be kept in effect. Because
of disobedience, the house would be desolate of a ruler. But in Matthew 23:39,
Christ Himself promises that He will come back as King of kings and Lord of
Lords.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Zechariah 14:4-9. When is this house, kingdom and throne
fulfilled? At the Second Advent describe here. Note verse 9, “And the Lord
shall be king over all the earth; in that day shall there be one Lord and His
name one.” Just as there was a Christmas, a first advent, so there will be a
New Years, the second advent.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ezekiel 37:22. Israel and Judah which were divided shall
unite and it will be one united kingdom. Note the context of Ezekiel 37:15-28.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Amos 9:11, Jeremiah 23:5-6. The Davidic Throne is
re-established. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Note well: Be sure to illustrate this lesson. Get it well
in hand so it will be fresh, vital and present Him as the only qualified Savior
that can save us from sin and human good. Especially breathe this lesson and
the next in prayer. The next lesson is the New Covenant and you may have a few
absentees because of colds, conflicts and cares of this world. The reason, it
is the very heart of the Gospel and shows the Seed of David dying on the cross
for our sins. An excellent climax to this lesson is to have the class turn to
Revelation 22:16 where Christ calls Himself the “root and the offspring of
David” and give the Gospel clearly to them. The invitation is “come.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Conclusions of the Davidic Covenant</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Israel must be preserved as a nation. She will be brought
into the land at a future time (the Second Advent). David’s Son, Jesus Christ,
will return bodily, literally, to reign over this future Davidic Kingdom. He
will reign over a literal, earthly kingdom. This kingdom will be an eternal
kingdom as well.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Session 6 - The New Covenant</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Pointers in Teaching</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The New Covenant speaks of the new birth. Therefore, it
is very important to the eternal welfare of the class. The development of this
covenant can be very simple. Subject: Blessing.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>John 3: In the Nicodemus/Christ conversation, the Lord
told Nicodemus, a religious minister that he needed to be born again. Nicodemus
didn’t know what the Lord was talking about. But in John 3:10, Christ said to
Nicodemus, “Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Now ask a key question. The New Testament Scriptures were
not written at this time. Yet Jesus Christ held Nicodemus accountable for
knowing what the term “born again” meant. Where in the Old Testament does it
say that you must be born again? Christ expected Nicodemus who had only the Old
Testament to know. Do you?</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><img width=440 height=450
src="Evangelistic%20Home%20Bible%20Class%20Manual6.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jeremiah 31:31-34: Here the New Covenant is declared.
Read it to the class.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Background and time factor: Judah, the Southern kingdom,
had followed the footsteps of her sister in the north, the ten northern tribes.
The ten tribes had been taken captive in 722 BC. At this time, 586 BC is fast
approaching when the Babylonian captivity will take place. But even in those
hours of gross and black sin, God comes with a ray of hope. A day yet future
will see the establishment of a New Covenant with Israel.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jer. 31:31: This covenant mentions Israel and Judah
because at this time they are still divided.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jer. 31:32: This covenant is not going to be like the
Mosaic Law which was broken by the children of Israel.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jer. 31:33: This is going to be a law, however, but
internal rather than external.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jer. 31:34: The production of this covenant in the life
of the people is fantastic, “...for they shall know Me...I will forgive their
iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Problem with the Mosaic Law: The Mosaic Law was good. It
convicted Israel of their sin. It foreshadowed Christ. It helped the people get
along with each other. But it could not create in man a clean heart, cleanse
sin, and pour out blessing through the indwelling and filling of the Holy
Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What does the Law say to people? Thou shalt not!
Reaction: I want to break it! Some people have the mental attitude that laws
are made to be broken. And, then they proceed to break them.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What happens when you make cookies, put them on a shelf
and then point it out to your children saying, “Don’t get in that jar of
cookies up there.” Then you go outside to hang up some clothes. What happens?
Naturally, they want to get into that jar and have a cookie, or two.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Law said, “You have to!” The New Covenant through the
new nature, forgiveness of sin and the indwelling of the Spirit changed a
person’s desire. Instead of “you have to” it was “I want to.” I want to obey
the Lord. This is basic in raising children, getting them to want to do
something rather than having to be commanded to do something.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Illustrate further with the “Wet Paint” illustration.
Have you ever passed a painted park bench with such a sign on it and went to
touch the bench to see if it was still wet?</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Joel 2:28-32: Now for the “how.” How do I get the law
inside of the heart? (Jer. 31:33) What are the mechanics? Note that this law
being placed inside of the heart is equated with being born again. This sheds
some light on John 3.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Joel 2:28-29: “And it shall come to pass afterward, that
I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters
shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see
visions: And also upon the servants and upon the hard maids in those days will
I pour out my Spirit.” This is quoted in Acts 2:17ff.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ezekiel 11:19: But before we interpret the Joel passage,
what does the term “pour out” mean? Note such passages as Ezekiel 11:19: “And I
will give them one heart, and I will put a new Spirit within you; and I will
take the stony heart out of their flesh....” The term “pour out” is used in the
sense of placing the Spirit of God within. It carries a concept of indwelling
and filling (spiritually).</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Illustrate by stating that God wants to pour out His life
through the believer. The character of Christ is formed within the believer. A
father pours his life, either good or bad, into his son. Develop this concept.
I personally believe that on 99 out of 100 things I would know exactly how my
father would react. My dad has poured his life into mine. Just so, the Holy
Spirit wants to pour His life into yours. This is a concept that really grips
the soul. Now, back to the Joel passage.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Joel 2 passage predicted a future day in which the
Holy Spirit would indwell and fill (control) Israelites. Peter quotes this
announcement of Joel’s in his sermon on the day of Pentecost in Acts 2. Peter
explained the fact that those filled with the Spirit on the day of Pentecost
who were speaking in tongues were not drunken. They were just paralleling a
phenomenon similar to what would happen at a future date to Israel at the Second
Advent. Now think that statement through. It is very important to grasp it!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Let’s go a little deeper in the problem of interpretation
as Peter used the Joel passage in Acts to illustrate or apply it to explain
what was happening on the day of Pentecost. Remember, Joel spoke of Israel and
the kingdom. Joel referred to a future day when Israel would be a converted
people. Now obviously Israel was not in a condition of belief as a nation when
Peter quoted Joel. The King was not reigning on earth. He was not even on
earth. He had been crucified, buried, but had risen and ascended into heaven.
Now then, could he say that what had occurred on that day was the fulfillment
of what Joel had spoken of?</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is very important to get this. The Abrahamic Covenant,
as we know, was divided into three parts: land, seed and blessing. The New
Covenant deals with the blessing part of that original promise. The blessing
was that in a future day (Second Advent) Israel was going to experience the
very indwelling of the Holy Spirit. They were going to be born again. They were
going to be filled. Millennial spirituality would be the result. There would be
ecstatics in the Millennium similar to that experience on the day of Pentecost
and until the transition was over in the book of Acts by 70 AD. These same
ecstatics are not legitimate in the Church Age since 70 AD.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Genesis 12:3 says, “...in thee all nations shall be
blessed.” The blessing then, was to be shared by all men who believed, Jew and
Gentile alike. It is this universal aspect of the blessing of the Abrahamic
Covenant that we see in the application of Joel’s prophecy to those indwelt and
filled by the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost. This passage is a lesson on
the difference between interpretation and illustration. Joel 2, as far as the
interpretation goes, refers to the Second Advent when Israel will see the
Messiah and be indwelt and filled by believing in the One they had rejected.
Peter illustrated the similarity of that event with the one that happened on
the day of Pentecost to explain what was happening.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Now if this seems hard to understand, it may take some
extra study to get over the humps and make it your own. Again, don’t get bogged
down. It is not essential to thoroughly exposit Joel 2 and Acts 2, but only
share here what you understand.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Hebrews 8:6-12; 9:14-15; 10:16–20: Christ is the agent of
the New Covenant.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Why is the New Covenant a better covenant and based on
better promises? Heb. 8:6. This is answered in context. Explain the place of
the blood in the New Covenant. Heb. 9:14-22. There is no forgiveness without
the shedding of His blood, the giving of life. Has the thought expressed in Hebrews
10:17 gripped you? God provided cleansing for sin. He provides a new boldness in
Hebrews 10:19. And He also provides a new and living way in Hebrews 10:20.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Matthew 26:28; 1 Cor. 11:23-25:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Matthew 26:28 says, “For this is my blood of the new
testament (covenant) which is shed for many for the remission of sins,”
(forgiveness). Communion actually commemorates the shedding of blood by Christ
which made the New Covenant applicable to us with all its “blessing” benefits.
The result is being born again by believing in Jesus Christ and enjoying
communion (fellowship) with the Lord.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 Cor. 11:23-25: The body (bread) speaks of the person of
Christ. He was the unique God-man who could die for our sins. The blood speaks
of the Work of Christ which was effectual because of the uniqueness of the
person of Christ. In verse 25 when the “new testament” is mentioned, it is
referring to the New Covenant. Communion may mean much less than it should if
one does not understand the New Covenant. In fact, one of the divisions of the
Bible is Old Testament (Covenant) and New Testament (Covenant). The one refers
to the Mosaic Law, the other the Covenant that replaced it.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This may be a good time to pull in the nets. Most of the
people before you are familiar with communion. Stress that communion means
nothing without an understanding of regeneration, forgiveness of sin,
indwelling of the Holy Spirit and other related biblical truths. There should
be intense conviction. Review how Abraham believed in the Messiah to come.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Galatians 3:13-14: This blessing is not for Jews only,
but also for the Gentiles. Although this covenant will be ultimately fulfilled
at the Second Advent according to Acts 2:15-21, Romans 11:26-27, Ezekiel
34:25-31, right now you can enjoy its benefits by accepting Jesus Christ as
personal Savior.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Promotion of the next session. Let them know that the
next lesson will be on prophecy. Many are usually vitally interested in
prophecy. The chapter will be Matthew 24 and nearly all the time will be
devoted to that one chapter. Give them an inkling of what to expect to whet
appetites.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Session 7 - Fulfillment of the Four Covenants</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Matthew 24-25 tells us the four covenants will be
fulfilled at the Second Advent of Jesus Christ. This is a hinge chapter in that
it ties the Old and New Testaments together as far as the covenants are
concerned. That which is promised in the Old Testament is shown fulfilled in
the New Testament. This is a very important chapter.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This chapter also (it should begin in Matthew 23:37)
explains the relationship of the rejection of Christ and the fulfillment of the
covenants. Christ, the long promised Seed of the Davidic Covenant had arrived (First
Advent) to sit upon the throne of David and rule a receptive people He came and
presented Himself as the promised Messiah to set up the long awaited Kingdom.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Upon seeing Him in the First Advent (when He was born a babe
in a manger) Israel should have accepted Him. They did not. Had they done so,
the promises to Israel in the Old Testament would have been fulfilled. But
since He was rejected, they were not fulfilled. Would they be at a future time?
If so, when? The house has been “left unto you desolate.” These questions Matt.
24-25 will answer.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Note: When you teach this session be sure to start with
Matthew 23:37. This statement of Jesus including verses 38 and 39 arouses the
three questions in the minds of the disciples.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Pointers in teaching: This class should have some
chronology to orient the class to the time period of the Tribulation. There are
several ways this can be done. We would suggest the following way. Familiarize
them with the broad, general time periods of human history. They may be called
divine categories of history or dispensations. Fill in with the major events of
history, the Rapture, Second Advent, when the Great White Throne Judgment
occurs and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Jewish Age stops seven literal years short of
completion at the Cross. This seven years is picked up between the Rapture of
the Church and the Second Advent. This is Daniel’s 70th week. Daniel 9. The Millennial
reign of Christ on earth begins shortly after the Second Advent. Since these
lessons are largely chronological, this will fit into the entire survey
approach of the class.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You may wish to use Revelation at this point in survey
fashion to give chronological background. This is done by presenting the time
table of Revelation and then the chapter titles. Some years ago at Dallas
Theological Seminary, Dr. Charles Woodbridge challenged the students to
memorize chapter titles for each chapter of the entire Word of God. Also I was
embarrassed after eight years of schooling in the Scriptures to not be able to
tell what was in Luke 13 or Matthew 22 or Joel 2 without opening my Bible. Consequently,
I began memorizing chapter titles in some New Testament portions and found it a
tremendous blessing to “think through” the contents of these books.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Howard Hendricks, to whom I will always be greatly
indebted said one time in class, “Men, my greatest handicap is that I don’t
have the Word of God at my fingertips like I would like it to be.” This is not
an exact quotation, but that statement has stabbed me for a long time. We need
to know the Word.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Exposition of Matthew 24</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus had recognized the condition of the nation Israel.
Fulfillment of the promises was abandoned as far as His first coming was
concerned. He turned away from His own and left their house desolate. He
departed from the temple this time for good. He never did return to the temple
or to Jerusalem publicly and openly. He states that He would not do so until
there was a second triumphal entry and the people would say, “Blessed is He
that cometh in the name of the Lord.” Jesus had now rejected Israel, not though,
till they had rejected Him. What He will say to the disciples in the Mt. Olivet
Discourse. (Matt. 24-25 is very important).</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Leaving the temple, the disciples ask Jesus three
questions: When shall these things be? When are you coming again? When is the
end of the age to come? The following chart shows the last seven years of the
Jewish Age. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><img width=520 height=400
src="Evangelistic%20Home%20Bible%20Class%20Manual7.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Purpose of The Great Tribulation:</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To prepare the
nation Israel for her Messiah. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To pour
judgment on unbelieving man and nations.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Do not spend too much time on chronology. No time will be
left to explain Matthew 24. And it is that chapter that will give a punch to
the class. Again the questions: When shall these things be? When are you coming
again? When is the end of the age to come?</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first question is related to the statement made by
Jesus in the opening verse of chapter 24 that the temple is to be destroyed.
They ask Him “when?” Matthew did not choose to record the answer Jesus made to
this statement. However, Luke, did in chapter 21:20-24. This occurred
historically in 70 A.D. when the Romans under the leadership of Titus destroyed
the temple (Herod’s temple). A yet future destruction is also envisioned when
the Man of Sin (the Anti-Christ) will harass Jews and murder them, commit the
abomination of desolation in the temple, and pillage the city again just before
Christ shall come to triumphantly take Jerusalem and regather the Jews. (Cf.
Zech. 14:2, Rev. 11:2)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Matthew records the answer Jesus gave to the final two
questions. He will give numerous signs that precede His Second Advent. He will
pinpoint the end of the Jewish Age or Age of Israel with His return, the Second
Advent.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Note very, very carefully: The correct interpretation of
this passage hinges on the last word of verse 3. The King James Version
translated this word “world.” However, it is the Greek word for “age.” Thus,
the phrase “end of the world” in Matthew 24:3 is actually “end of the age! What
age? Well, what age were these Jewish disciples interested in? The Church Age?
No. The Jewish Age, of course. The Messiah had been cut off at the cross.
Daniel’s 70 weeks had run their course except for the very last one. Seven
years had to be picked up. So the question does not involve the Church Age but
the Jewish Age. Check various translations. Most translate this correctly as
“age.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Now granted, the Church Age has a few of the things
described in Matthew 24. True, the latter end of the Church Age is perilous,
but during the Tribulation everything is greatly intensified. Just like a great
chess game, God is setting up His board, so that when the Rapture occurs,
immediately the 70th week of Daniel will begin. It may be helpful at this
point, if you have not done so previously, to explain what you mean by Daniel’s
70 weeks.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As you go through Matthew 24 verse by verse, notice the
signs of the Second Advent of Christ. Wars, rumors of wars, famines,
pestilence, earthquakes in many places, the lightning coming out of the east
and flashing forth to the west, are all signs of the Second Advent. Remember
that at the First Advent one of the signs was a virgin conceiving and another
was the famous star.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Note verse 6: “...but the end is not yet.” The end of
what? The world? Doomsday, whatever that is? (Their answer here will prove how
well you have taught them verse 3.) No, the end of the age. What age? The end
of the Tribulation, the end of the Jewish Age.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Note verse 13: “But he that shall endure unto the end,
the same shall be saved.” Again, the end of what? His Christian life? If I
don’t endure I’ll lose my salvation as a believer? This verse is held as a
bloody club over many people. Again, the end of what? The end of the Jewish Age
is what the verse is talking about and this is the end of the Tribulation, the
Second Advent. Then, saved in what way? It means delivered to go into the Millennium
to enjoy the King and Kingdom on earth. The gist of the verse is this, “But he
that shall endure (physically) unto the end of the Jewish Age, Second Advent)
the same shall be saved (delivered to go into the Millennium). The disciples
are interested in His coming in relation to them.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Note verse 14: “And this gospel of the kingdom (believe
in the Lord Jesus Christ, He is coming back) shall be preached in all the world
(<i>oikoumene</i>, inhabited earth) for a witness unto all nations; and then
shall the end come (end of the Tribulation, Second Advent).” This isn’t
speaking of the end of the Church Age. Keep in context!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Note verse 22: “And except those days be shortened (Tribulation)
there should be no flesh (physical reference) be saved (delivered to live on
the earth during the Millennium) but for the elects’ (Jews who believed during
the Tribulation) sake those days shall be shortened.” The term saved sometimes
means physical deliverance in the Bible. The Bible has a message of comfort for
people in all ages and there is much overlap. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Tribulation will be so fierce that all flesh would
perish, which would thwart the plan of God, for there have to be believers to
populate the Millennium (unresurrected saints). All unbelievers die so only
believers are around to populate the Millennium.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Note verse 33: “So likewise ye, when ye shall see all
these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.” What things? These
signs. What is near? The Second Advent. The second phase of His second coming.
The Rapture is not in view here at all. Remember the tribulational saint needs
specific comfort and encouragement too. We often want to fit everything into a
Church Age area.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>So the signs are numerous all during the Tribulation;
wars, rumors of war, earthquakes, etc. Thus, the second question is answered.
Go through the chapter and count the signs. Then the answer to the third
question is obviously the Second Advent.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A thought: Most would say that the fig tree here refers
to Israel. But contextually, the fig tree here is symbolic of the Tribulation
and summer refers to the Millennium. Think it over. Now for the supreme test.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Note verse 37: “But as the days of Noah were, so shall
also the coming of the Son of man be.” What coming is this? The second coming,
right? But what phase of the second coming, Rapture or Second Advent?
Contextually, the Second Advent. Verse 39 speaks of judgment in connection with
the Second Advent.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Note verses 40-41: “Then shall two be in the field; the
one shall be taken, and the other left. Two women shall be grinding at the
mill; the one shall be taken and the other left.” Here is a loaded question: Is
this speaking of the Rapture or the Second Advent? You may get a few “oh’s”
right here. The Second Advent is in view. One shall be taken in judgment and
the other left to go into the Millennium, Christ’s long awaited kingdom on
earth.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken
(in judgment, Armageddon, an unbeliever) and the other left (to go into the Millennium).”
The other verse states the same thing. Note that this verse describes opposite
activity than the Rapture. In the Rapture, the believers are taken from the
earth (they are caught up), but at the Second Advent believers will remain on
the earth (to populate the Millennium).</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This interpretation has to be right because of contextual
facts. Better to tear up the message that has the Rapture based on these verses
than be inaccurate. The rest of chapter 24 and 25 bear out the fact of blessing
and judgment. The rest of the passage speaks of blessing and judgment.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Verse 42: “Watch therefore ...” This is addressed to
believers. “You watch for the Second Advent.” (A great many will be saved
during the Tribulation. See Rev. 7:9-17.) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Verse 44: “Therefore be ye also ready....”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Verse 46: “Blessed is that servant....” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Verse 48: “But and if that evil servant....” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Verse 51: “And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his
portion with the hypocrites; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Chapter 25 of Matthew pursues the same theme. The parable
of the virgins and the talents indicates which Israelites go into the earthly Millennial
kingdom promised to the nation, only those who are indwelt by the Holy Spirit
according to the New Covenant. Those who are not are taken in judgment. “No
oil” is a symbol of unpreparedness and unpreparedness in this context is
equated with unbelief.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Gentile portion starts at verse 31 and indicates
which Gentile nations will go into the Millennium. At the Second Advent, there
will be Gentiles living, apparently, from every Gentile country who are
believers. The present earth is burned with fire after the Millennium. So,
someone is needed to populate these Gentile nations. Israel will be dwelling in
the Land. While no one was saved at the beginning of the Tribulation, everyone who
is alive will be saved at the start of the Millennium. Anyone not a believer is
killed; they perish. A great company of people who believe during the Tribulation
will die physically, but those who follow the instructions of Matthew 24:15-26
and flee quickly to the mountains of Edom, Moab and Ammon will escape death and
live through the holocaust to tread the Millennial earth according to Daniel
11:41 and 12:1. Daniel 12:1 says, “...and at that time thy people shall be
delivered (the ones who will go into the Millennium), everyone that shall be
found written in the book (believers are delivered).”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Then Daniel 12:2 answers the problem of saints who have
died during the Tribulation. They will be resurrected to a most glorious
resurrection of life. The Bible anticipates no problem with unresurrected
saints and resurrected saints mingling together on the earth in the Millennium.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Conclusion</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Abraham was promised land, seed and blessing. The land
afforded the nation Israel a geographical location, always needed in the case
of any nation. The land was Israel’s as far as the title deed, but to possess
and enjoy the land they had to be obedient. They, of course, failed to be
obedient through the Mosaic Law, so a New Covenant was invoked, that provided
for inward stability, forgiveness of sins, a new heart and mind, and a new
nature. But, this New Covenant was dependent upon the Davidic Covenant for a
qualified One had to come and die for the sins of the world. Finally, all of
these covenants are fulfilled at the Second Advent.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Thus, at the Second Advent, the nation of Israel will be indwelt
and filled with the Holy Spirit. The work of the Spirit will be a bit different
during the Millennium (more emotion can be legitimate then, than now) because
the King is present. But, Israel as a result of national conversion (all
individually believed) is obedient, and because they are obedient they can
possess and enjoy the Land. As such they need the perfect and qualified ruler
and administrator, so the Seed of David, the Lord Jesus Christ sits on David’s
throne and rules them.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Remind them that a very vivid lesson is present in this
portion of Scripture concerning the fate of the unbeliever and the blessing of
the believer. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If you wish to go from here into Romans (for next time)
to show how the blessing of Abraham comes upon the Gentiles (Galatians 3:14) it
works out very well. However, some will wish to have a two part New Testament
“walk through.” Lessons 8 &amp; 9 are designed to help in this endeavor. Plenty
of material is given in case you wish to be selective.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some are always prone to think this class on Matthew
24-25 is too complicated. We have never found it so. The layman is far too
underrated today. Teaching evangelism gives background facts to the Gospel
message, “Ye must be born again.” We are increasingly getting a pupil in class
who has no Sunday School background but who is no idiot either. The pupil needs
to be given something to be believed. Most who are converted through the Word
in these classes are healthy believers. And as many men as women attend.
Shocking, but true!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Session 8 - The New Testament Walk Through (Christ)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Part #1 of New Testament Walk Through</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Consider your time factor in giving out background
materials. Be selective in the following material. Much is given. Divide the
living room into three sections, Galilee, Samaria, Judea. Drop the use of the
word Canaan and use Palestine instead. Identify the area with people in the
room.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><img width=400 height=500
src="Evangelistic%20Home%20Bible%20Class%20Manual8.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Give background of conditions leading up to Christ’s
birth: The great world powers, Babylon, Media-Persia, Greece, Rome. The Tunnel
Period (silence for 400 years). Events surrounding the birth of John the
Baptist. The Birth of the Lord Jesus Christ - Luke 2.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Where was the Lord born? Some may say Jerusalem. Success
again depends upon pupil participation. Locate Bethlehem on the living room
map. The next event was the coming of the shepherds in Luke 2:8-20. They tended
the sacrificial sheep flocks on the hills surrounding Bethlehem. These sheep
were sacrifices in Jerusalem on feast days. Then, a year or so later, the
coming of the wisemen to the house in Bethlehem where he was. Matthew 2. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The slaughter of the innocents by Herod. Matt. 2:16-18.
Just previous to this, Christ, Joseph and Mary had gone to Egypt. Indicate on
the map in the living room. It also would help to have a large map hanging up
showing the different areas.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Return of Jesus to Nazareth: (Sweep arms from Egypt to
province of Galilee.) Some Bible teachers say that He was in Egypt till nearly
12. Matthew 2:19-23. Jesus attends the feast at Jerusalem at age 12. Luke
2:41-51.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Book of Matthew used as a Walk Through: If you wish
to develop and trace the Galilean, Judaean, and Perean ministry, fine. We have
found it a bit tedious and so do not include it. Using the chapter title method
will be helpful. Here is a combination of an outline and chapter title peg to
hold the coat of the class’s thinking.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Birth and Reception of the King: Matt. 1-2 (Already
covered above) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Baptism of the King: Matt. 3 </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Testing of the King: Matt. 4 </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Proclamation of the King: Matt. 5-7 </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Revelation &amp; Instruction of the King: Matt. 14-20
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Formal Presentation of the King: Matt. 21-23 </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Predictions of the King: Matt. 24-25 </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Crucifixion and Resurrection of the King: Matt. 26-28</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Assign each of these chapter titles to the people there,
one to a customer. Make a game out of it and you will learn them quickly. Then
act out the chapter titles yourself through symbols. Act out baptism, testing,
preaching, credentials, parables, teaching, crucifixion, resurrection, and
ascension. Use your imagination. It will be fun as well as instructive.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Now by this time you may have consumed the entire lesson
period. If so, use Circumstances Surrounding Calvary for your next lesson. This
is a lecture lesson. It is designed to give maximum impact concerning Christ
dying for our sins. It is a two-hour lesson.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Apply at the end of the class: What is your relationship
with this One who died for you? Are you religious or truly born again? It is
best if this lecture is taught without obvious notes before you. Put what notes
you need into the margin of your Bible, various comments and where to go next.

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Session 9 - The New Testament Walk Through (Paul)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Part #2 of the New Testament Walk Through</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Pointers in Teaching: At the start of the class you can
review the previous information given in the New Testament walk through. Stress
again knowing how to “think through” the book of Matthew and answer any
questions they may have. By this time, I may have given some of the pupils this
manual so they can pinpoint their study and achieve better understanding.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This second part of the walk through can be started by
approaching the book of Acts from the standpoint of chapter titles. Here are
some suggested titles.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ch. 1 Commission and Ascension</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ch. 2 Pentecost</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ch. 3 Lame Man Healed</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ch. 4 The First Persecution</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ch. 5 Ananias and Sapphira</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ch. 6 The First Deacons</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ch. 7 Stephen and Martyrdom</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ch. 8 Philip and the Eunuch</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ch. 9 Saul’s conversion</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ch. 10 Peter and Cornelius</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ch. 11 Peter Vindicates Ministry to the Gentiles</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ch. 12-14 First Missionary Journey</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ch. 15 The Jerusalem Council</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ch. 16-18 Second Missionary Journey</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ch. 19-20 Third Missionary Journey</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ch. 21 Paul Arrives at Jerusalem</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ch. 22 Paul’s Defense before the Multitudes </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ch. 23 Paul’s Defense before before the Sanhedrin</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ch. 24 Paul’s Defense before Felix</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ch. 25 Paul’s Defense before Festus</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ch. 26 Paul’s Defense before King Agrippa</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ch. 27 Shipwreck</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ch. 28 Rome</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Again, you may assign these chapters to different
individuals in the room, and go over it enough that they learn them. Then if
you want to dramatize the New Testament you can hang it upon the missionary
journeys of the Apostle Paul. There are four if you count the period of time
between Paul’s first Roman imprisonment (Acts 28) and his second or final
imprisonment (2 Timothy).</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Lay out the living room including the areas traveled in
his missionary journeys. This would include Palestine, Syria, Asia Minor,
Galatia, Europe, etc. You may have to put Italy in the kitchen. Give a bit of
interesting historical background on each geographical region. Information can
be found in any Bible dictionary.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Paul’s Missionary Journeys</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As you walk through these journeys have a map also
visible and use it liberally. As you move from place to place say something
Scriptural about each place. Some may want to follow along with open Bibles.  See
category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/P/Paul%2C%20Missionary%20Journeys.html">Paul, Missionary Journeys</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Once the journey has been traced through all three trips,
review it a couple times so that everyone can not only trace it, but can
visualize it geographically. Then, tell the story of his journeys once more
this time inserting the story of the books Paul wrote. For instance, when your
group thinks of Lystra they should visualize the stoning of Paul on the first
missionary journey. They should know that Paul visited Thessalonica on the
second missionary journey and then later on during the same journey he wrote 1
&amp; 2 Thessalonians from Corinth. Paul spent 18 months in Corinth.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is a beautiful study if you can master it and
present it clearly and simply.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Book Chart</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>No books were written on Paul’s first missionary journey
unless, as some think, Galatians was written at this time.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 &amp; 2 Thess., second missionary journey, from
Corinth.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 Cor. written from Ephesus on the third missionary
journey.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>2 Cor. written from Ephesus on the third missionary
journey.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Galatians and Romans from Corinth on the third missionary
journey.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Philemon from Rome,
first imprisonment.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 &amp; 2 Timothy and Titus from Rome in the second
imprisonment.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Hebrews was probably not written by Paul at all, but by
Apollos.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>A Helpful New Testament Time Chart</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:10.5pt'>(All New Testament Books
are not Included in this Chart)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><img border=0 width=520 height=300
src="Evangelistic%20Home%20Bible%20Class%20Manual9.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The chart, as you noticed did not include all the New
Testament books. The New Testament covers approximately 100 years. Peter and
Paul were already several years in the presence of the Lord after the terrible
persecution of Nero in 67-68 AD.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This concludes the two parts of the New Testament walk
through. Very important: Do not cover all this material just to cover it. You
may have to squeeze in an extra session or delete some of the material. Or, you
may go rapidly over this material in one class, introducing it and then in the
next class spend much time in review. You can go faster if the class has this
manual to use when you teach the class.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At any rate, what you do teach, teach properly and
orderly by getting it well in hand. Use this material first in family devotions
if you wish. Children especially enjoy “acted out” devotions. Now, we are ready
to teach Romans. Note the style in which it is taught.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Session 10 – Sin (Romans 1 – Romans 3:23)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Book of Romans gives a clear presentation of the New
Covenant as applied to the Gentiles and the Church Age. Galatians 3:14 states,
“That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ;
that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The New Covenant spells out the blessing promise made to
Abraham. Although Abraham was a Jew, we share in these blessings through being
born again. The Book of Romans is a basic theology book of the New Testament.
It is a primer of doctrine. Whenever Jewish terminology is used in Romans, it
is explained. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A basic outline of the Book of Romans, chapters 1-8 is as
follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Sin: Romans
1:1-3:23</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Salvation:
Romans 3:24-5:21</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Sanctification:
Romans 6-8</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Or this one:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Romans 1 -
All Gentiles under sin.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Romans 2 -
All Jews under sin.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Romans 3 -
All have sinned.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Romans 4-5 -
Justification is the answer to sin.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Romans 6-8 -
The Christian walk, the doctrine of walking in the Spirit.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Exposition: The style of teaching will vary in a home
from the style used in the pulpit. Be sure to keep the class moving and in good
tempo. Keep to the main aim of the class...teaching evangelism.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Session 11 – Salvation (Romans 3:24 – Romans 5:21)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Pointers in Teaching:  Review Romans 1-3 asking questions
of the class. Ask them the chapter titles for the first three chapters.  Romans
1-3 provides an understanding of the basic facts of salvation, an unusual
conviction about matters pertaining to the faith, and their usefulness in
practical Christian service. If you are now a Christian, you either have to go
on with the Lord, or be miserable, irritable, hard to live with...and I mean
with a vengeance. There is no lagging back for the believer.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Justification By Faith, Not Works</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/J/Justification.html">Justification</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Wrap up the class by a challenge to get Bible doctrine.
You can regulate the length of the class by how much review you give at the
beginning of the class and how many questions are asked during and after the
class. Often a class will be greatly helped by someone who asks questions,
honest, seeking questions.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Session 12 – Sanctification (Romans 6 – Romans 8)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is often the last session unless an optional lesson
is taught on death and contemporary history. More than likely you have taken
some extra sessions to cover the material thoroughly to this point.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is important before disbanding the class to give the
believers some basic principles needed for maximum enjoyment of the Christian
life. Normally, if this is a two hour class, we would spend only a half hour
summarizing these three chapters in Romans. Then, for the bulk of the time, we
go over the five basic techniques for daily living.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At this point you may want to summarize the first session
up through the last one briefly. The class should be able to see the entire
study in its construction. Romans as far as chapter titles could be reviewed.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Chapter 1 - All Gentiles under sin. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Chapter 2 - All Jews under sin. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Chapter 3 - All have sinned. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Chapter 4 - Justification (salvation). </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Chapter 5 - Justification (salvation). </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Chapter 6 - The Christian walk. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Chapter 7 - The Christian walk. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Chapter 8 - The Christian walk.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Romans 6 - The Christian Walk</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Identification</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Now that we are saved, should we keep on sinning as in
pre-salvation days? Paul says in Romans 6:2 “May it never be!” This is a strong
construction meaning “certainly not!” We need to learn the basics for Christian
living.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin so that
grace may increase? May it never be! How shall we who died to sin still live in
it?&quot;  (Romans 6:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What does the phrase “died to sin” mean? Paul spends the
rest of the chapter describing what he means. The believer is identified with
Christ in His death, burial and resurrection. In effect, when He died, all
believers died. In effect, when He was buried, the believer was buried. In
effect, when He arose, the believer arose. This death breaks the dominion of
sin in the believer’s life. This identification takes place when you become a
believer in the Lord Jesus Christ. Although you cannot understand it, you must
take it by faith.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized
into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death? Therefore we have been
buried with Him through baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from
the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of
life. For if we have become united with Him in the likeness of His death,
certainly we shall also be in the likeness of His resurrection, knowing this,
that our old self was crucified with Him, in order that our body of sin might
be done away with, so that we would no longer be slaves to sin; for he who has
died is freed from sin. Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we
shall also live with Him, knowing that Christ, having been raised from the
dead, is never to die again; death no longer is master over Him. For the death
that He died, He died to sin once for all; but the life that He lives, He lives
to God.&quot;  (Romans 6:3-10, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Faith Because of Identification</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are to have faith that the fact of identification is
true. Count on it, that the fact is true. On the basis of that fact, stop
letting sin reign as king in your body. Confess sin biblically and stay in
fellowship. Rom. 6:11-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Even so consider yourselves to be dead to sin, but alive
to God in Christ Jesus. Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so
that you obey its lusts, and do not go on presenting the members of your body
to sin as instruments of unrighteousness; but present yourselves to God as
those alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to
God.&quot;  (Romans 6:11-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Mental Attitude Because of Identification</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is a mental attitude that results from confessing
sin biblically and allows the fruit of the Spirit to be manifest. Eternal life
is to be lived out to the full. Rom. 6:14; Rom. 6:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For sin shall not be master over you, for you are not
under law but under grace.&quot;  (Romans 6:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But now having been freed from sin and enslaved to God,
you derive your benefit, resulting in sanctification, and the outcome, eternal
life.&quot;  (Romans 6:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Conflict of the Soul: Romans 7</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is a continuous conflict in the believer between
either the old sin nature controlling the soul or the Holy Spirit controlling
the soul. The believer’s temporal status is one or the other. Spirituality is
an absolute. Committing sins and the biblical confession of known sins to God
the Father determines the believer’s soul status. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><img border=0 width=460 height=400 id="Picture 1"
src="Evangelistic%20Home%20Bible%20Class%20Manual10.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Four Laws</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Law of God – the Mosaic Law. Rom. 7:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For I joyfully concur with the law of God in the inner
man,&quot;  (Romans 7:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Law of the old sin nature - “another law in my
members” Rom. 7:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;but I see a different law in the members of my body,
waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of
sin which is in my members.&quot;  (Romans 7:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Law of my Mind - wants to do the will of God, but
can’t because of the law of the old sin nature. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus. Rom. 8:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set
you free from the law of sin and of death.&quot;  (Romans 8:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Spirit-controlled Life: Romans 8</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Law of Fellowship - walking in the Spirit Rom. 8:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;so that the requirement of the Law might be fulfilled in
us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.&quot; 
(Romans 8:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The location of the Spirit - inside of you. Rom. 8:9;
Rom. 8:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;However, you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if
indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if anyone does not have the Spirit
of Christ, he does not belong to Him.&quot;  (Romans 8:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead
dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to
your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you.&quot;  (Romans 8:11,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The leading of the Spirit - as sons. Rom. 8:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are
sons of God.&quot;  (Romans 8:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The intercession of the Spirit - for believers. Rom.
8:26.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;In the same way the Spirit also helps our weakness; for
we do not know how to pray as we should, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for
us with groanings too deep for words;&quot;  (Romans 8:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The union and communion of God the Father and God the
Son. Rom. 8:28-39.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And we know that God causes all things to work together
for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His
purpose. For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to
the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many brethren;
and these whom He predestined, He also called; and these whom He called, He
also justified; and these whom He justified, He also glorified.&quot;  (Romans
8:28-30, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us,
who is against us? He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him over for
us all, how will He not also with Him freely give us all things?&quot;  (Romans
8:31-32, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will
tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or
sword?&quot;  (Romans 8:35, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor
angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,
nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us
from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.&quot;  (Romans
8:38-39, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Five Techniques of The Christian Life </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The last part of the class deals with the five techniques
of the Christian life, basics which are absolutely important to the rightful
execution of the Christian life. These five are: confessing sin biblically,
claiming the promises of God, the controlling ministry of the Holy Spirit,
living in the Word, and thinking divine viewpoint (thinking God’s thoughts
after Him). These will now be studied briefly. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Technique No. 1 - Confessing Sin Biblically</u></p>

Spirit</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Technique No. 4 - Living in the Word</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>See category on the <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/KL/Living%20in%20the%20Word.html">Living in
the Word</a>. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Technique No. 5 - Occupation with Christ - Thinking
Divine Viewpoint</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is not a warmed over version of the power of
positive thinking. This is a biblical technique for believers only. It has to
do with fellowship through meditation. It is “Looking unto Jesus, the author
and finisher of our faith.” Heb. 12:2. This technique is a must for maximum
enjoyment of the person and work of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of
faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame,
and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.&quot;  (Hebrews 12:2,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Occupation with Christ is for believers only. Believers
are what they think. This opens the whole realm of mental attitudes. Prov.
23:7. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For as he thinks within himself, so he is. He says to
you, &quot;Eat and drink!&quot; But his heart is not with you.&quot;  (Proverbs
23:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A believer’s physical beauty and success depend upon what
he thinks. Often you equate a tough person with a profane vocabulary or someone
with a strong physical stature. But, toughness is a mental attitude. You
actually are not beaten until you give up mentally. An illustration is that
some G.I.’s in the Korean War had give-up-itis. They had no desire to live and
if left alone, in 24-48 hours they were dead.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are two ways of thinking - Divine Viewpoint or
Human Viewpoint. The believer today needs mental attitude divine viewpoint. And
the believer can’t get it without Bible study. Bible study today is being
pooh-pooed in many circles. And the Christian public has stopped thinking,
because they have stopped studying. It is interesting that when Christians
habitually attend Bible class and the regular services where the Word is
faithfully taught, they learn to concentrate, to think, to stabilize.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Let the wicked forsake his way And the unrighteous man
his thoughts; And let him return to the LORD, And He will have compassion on
him, And to our God, For He will abundantly pardon. &quot;For My thoughts are
not your thoughts, Nor are your ways My ways,&quot; declares the LORD.
&quot;For as the heavens are higher than the earth, So are My ways higher than
your ways And My thoughts than your thoughts.&quot;  (Isaiah 55:7-9, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Illustration: When an individual accepts Christ as
Savior, how much divine viewpoint does he have in his frontal lobe? Just a
mustard seed of divine viewpoint. Note that the growing believer continues to
renew his mind through Bible study. Rom. 12:2. Human view point is displaced
with divine viewpoint.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed
by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is,
that which is good and acceptable and perfect.&quot;  (Romans 12:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The principle is that you need divine viewpoint to please
God. Human viewpoint never pleases God even though the old sin nature is
capable of producing beautiful, polished, human good. The unsaved person has
human viewpoint only. He says, “I work for what I get.” “The harder I work, the
more I’m entitled to.” The believer knows that he is saved by grace and he
keeps walking after salvation on a non-meritorious system called “faith.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The only source of divine viewpoint is the Bible. 1 Corinthians
2:16 tells us that the Bible is the mind of Christ. Therefore, I must know the
Word to know His mind and apply it to realize His will. Religion does not agree
with the above statement. Christianity is not a religion, but a personal
relationship with Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL
INSTRUCT HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Bible is the critic of the thoughts and intents of
the inner life. In Hebrews 4:12, the word “judge” is the same as “criticizer.”
Our thinking must jibe with His thinking; there is no peace without it.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For the word of God is living and active and sharper than
any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of
both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the
heart.&quot;  (Hebrews 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Some Areas of Mental Attitude</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Worldliness</u>: Worldliness is not what you do, it’s
what you think. The only answer to mental attitude worldliness is replacing
human viewpoint (worldliness) with divine viewpoint. One can have a beautiful
outward life as did the Pharisees and yet be completely shot through with human
viewpoint. You can be sitting in church and be worldly depending upon what you
are thinking. The use of cosmetics or the lack of them does not make you
worldly. It is what you think regarding them. Rom. 12:2, Col. 3:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed
by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is,
that which is good and acceptable and perfect.&quot;  (Romans 12:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Set your mind on the things above, not on the things that
are on earth.&quot;  (Colossians 3:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Peace</u>: Peace is an inner mental attitude. Peace is
not laying down our military arms and inviting some other foreign power to walk
all over us. This relaxed mental attitude enables one to really enjoy the
Christian walk regardless of other people or outward circumstances. What do you
do under pressure? Do you get upset? Use divine viewpoint, think it and apply
it. This is like the athlete who remains relaxed, calm, enjoying the
competition. Isa. 26:3, Phil. 4:6-8.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;The steadfast of mind You will keep in perfect
peace, Because he trusts in You.&quot;  (Isaiah 26:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and
supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the
peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, will guard your hearts and
your minds in Christ Jesus. Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is
honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is
of good repute, if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise,
dwell on these things.&quot;  (Philippians 4:6-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Giving</u>: This is a mental attitude. If the mental
attitude is not right, don’t give. Don’t give under pressure. Give with mental
attitude joy. You can only have this when in fellowship. It is your attitude
that counts.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Stability</u>: This is also a mental attitude. The
prime illustration of this is General Robert E. Lee, a believer, at the battle
of Gettysburg during the Civil War. Disaster report after disaster report came
to his headquarters, but he remained calm and had tremendous stability under
pressure. He kept right on thinking. Adults who are cry-babies or have mental
attitude fear are always unstable. Stability is the ability to think under
pressure.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A key passage illustrating divine viewpoint versus human
viewpoint is 2 Corinthians 10. A key passage applying divine viewpoint to
experience is 1 Samuel 17 – David versus Goliath, “The Battle is the Lord’s!” </p>

<p class=Verses>“But we will not boast beyond our measure, but within the
measure of the sphere which God apportioned to us as a measure, to reach even
as far as you. For we are not overextending ourselves, as if we did not reach
to you, for we were the first to come even as far as you in the gospel of
Christ; not boasting beyond our measure, that is, in other men's labors, but
with the hope that as your faith grows, we will be, within our sphere, enlarged
even more by you, so as to preach the gospel even to the regions beyond you,
and not to boast in what has been accomplished in the sphere of another. But HE
WHO BOASTS IS TO BOAST IN THE LORD.” (2 Corinthians 10:13-17, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“The Philistine also said to David, &quot;Come to me, and I
will give your flesh to the birds of the sky and the beasts of the field.&quot;
Then David said to the Philistine, &quot;You come to me with a sword, a spear,
and a javelin, but I come to you in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of
the armies of Israel, whom you have taunted. &quot;This day the LORD will
deliver you up into my hands, and I will strike you down and remove your head
from you. And I will give the dead bodies of the army of the Philistines this
day to the birds of the sky and the wild beasts of the earth, that all the
earth may know that there is a God in Israel, and that all this assembly may
know that the LORD does not deliver by sword or by spear; for the battle is the
LORD'S and He will give you into our hands.&quot;” (1 Samuel 17:44-47, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This lesson probably has too much material. Consequently
if you wish to divide it into two lessons, it might prove more effective. An
optional lesson can also be worked up on death, or contemporary history in the
light of the Bible. Also, some may prefer to summarize the whole series of
lessons with the portion entitled, “The Evangelistic Thrust.” This will explain
why the Lord blesses this unique approach.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>In Conclusion: The Evangelistic Thrust</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Thousands of people have shared that they have been born
again through this unique Evangelistic Home Bible Class. But the question is
often asked, “This seems to be a rather different approach to evangelism. Why
would the study of the covenants be so productive in the sphere of evangelism?”
Admittedly, the study of the four unconditional covenants to Israel mentioned
in this manual is usually done on an academic level. Rarely would the covenants
be taught from the pulpits of our land, much less equate them with evangelism
in the home. However, the very heart of evangelism is the Abrahamic,
Palestinian, Davidic and New Covenants.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The following summary study is to convince the reader of
this manual that the main thrust of these covenants is evangelism, and is so
used throughout the New Testament.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Birth of John the Baptist, Luke 1:57-80</u>. The
passage under consideration is filled with references to the covenants. The
house of David is mentioned, also that God was remembering the holy covenant
which He swore to Abraham. Luke 1:72-73. The unconditional element of these
covenants was emphasized in the Old Testament, now here we keep on realizing
the faithfulness of God as well. Luke 1:76-77. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;To show mercy toward our fathers, And to remember His
holy covenant, The oath which He swore to Abraham our father,&quot;  (Luke
1:72-73, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;And you, child, will be called the prophet of the
Most High; For you will go on BEFORE THE LORD TO PREPARE HIS WAYS; To give to
His people the knowledge of salvation By the forgiveness of their sins,&quot; 
(Luke 1:76-77, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Peter’s First Message, Acts 2:15-41</u>. A careful
reading of this passage illustrates that Peter’s entire message was based on
the promises (covenants) of God. He quotes from Joel 2, connecting this passage
with salvation. He mentions David at length and explains that the Davidic
Covenant promised that God “would raise up Christ to sit on his (David’s)
throne.” Acts 2:30. This message was used by God to save 3,000 souls. Peter
used the covenants for evangelistic purposes.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;And so, because he was a prophet and knew that GOD
HAD SWORN TO HIM WITH AN OATH TO SEAT one OF HIS DESCENDANTS ON HIS
THRONE,&quot;  (Acts 2:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Peter’s Second Message Acts 3:12-26</u>. This
thrilling message resulted in 5,000 being saved. Acts 4:4. What was the heart
of the message? Evangelism? What approach does he use? The Abrahamic Covenant!</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But many of those who had heard the message believed; and
the number of the men came to be about five thousand.&quot;  (Acts 4:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In developing this passage, note that the healing of the
lame man had caused a crowd to gather. A close study of the context proves that
the important thing about this event is not the healing of the lame man, but
the fact that he was saved. Then with the large crowd milling around, Peter
quickly gains their attention and preaches to them.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 3:13, he mentions the “God of Abraham, Isaac and
Jacob, the God of our fathers.” This statement is used many times in the
Scriptures and always takes in the Abrahamic Covenant and its promises. The
covenant was given to Abraham and his seed and of course, it is confirmed many,
many times in succeeding chapters of the Word of God. In fact, the word
“covenant” appears approximately 300 times in the Bible. For example, in
Genesis 26 it is confirmed to Isaac. In Genesis 28, the covenant it is
confirmed to Jacob.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the God of our
fathers, has glorified His servant Jesus, the one whom you delivered and
disowned in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release Him.&quot; 
(Acts 3:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When Moses needed divine strength, God confirmed the
covenant to him in Exodus 6:13. Immediately after this the plagues began, but
Moses stands up to the pressure. So, the Abrahamic Covenant is used for
edification as well.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, and gave them
a charge to the sons of Israel and to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the sons
of Israel out of the land of Egypt.&quot;  (Exodus 6:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>However, the heart of Peter’s message, actually the
invitation at the close of the message, is found in the Acts 3:25-26. Note them
very carefully. Thus he ends his sermon.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;It is you who are the sons of the prophets and of
the covenant which God made with your fathers, saying to Abraham, 'AND IN YOUR
SEED ALL THE FAMILIES OF THE EARTH SHALL BE BLESSED.' &quot;For you first, God
raised up His Servant and sent Him to bless you by turning every one of you
from your wicked ways.&quot;&quot;  (Acts 3:25-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Now get this is exciting! What does Peter use in the
Church Age as the basis for extending the Gospel message? The Abrahamic
Covenant which promises land, seed, and blessing. The promises which were
amplified to present a qualified Savior who would die on the Cross for the sins
of the entire world. This is the very heart of the Gospel. The term “blessed”
as developed in the New Covenant spells out the tremendous blessing proceeding
out of Christ’s work on Calvary.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Note again the results in Acts 4:4. It may be well to say
here that there are as many men as women reached in these classes. Also that
the author of this manual had taught this class at least five years before the
tremendous evangelistic thrust of these classes hit him. No wonder many souls
are saved by His grace using these Scriptures.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But many of those who had heard the message believed; and
the number of the men came to be about five thousand.&quot;  (Acts 4:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>These class sessions are especially effective among the
unsaved religious persons. They, as the Jews, have lived lawful lives and also
are very self-righteous. But the same Gospel that reaches the religious lost,
also reaches the rascals of society as well.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Romans 11:27 and surrounding context makes it very clear
that evangelism is one of the thrusts of the covenants.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;THIS IS MY COVENANT WITH THEM, WHEN I TAKE AWAY
THEIR SINS.&quot;&quot;  (Romans 11:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Gal. 3:6-16. The message of Galatians 3 very aptly
pinpoints the evangelistic burden of the Abrahamic Covenant and connection
covenants. It may be well to quote Galatians 3:6-9. This very clear passage
leaves no doubt that evangelism is very definitely the fruit of proclaiming the
Abrahamic Covenant and the three covenants amplify the land, seed, and blessing
promises of it.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Even so Abraham BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS RECKONED TO HIM
AS RIGHTEOUSNESS. Therefore, be sure that it is those who are of faith who are
sons of Abraham. The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles
by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, &quot;ALL THE
NATIONS WILL BE BLESSED IN YOU.&quot; So then those who are of faith are
blessed with Abraham, the believer.&quot;  (Galatians 3:6-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As the passage continues, Christ is described dying on
the Cross so that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through
Jesus Christ. Gal. 3:14. Here again we see a key verse with evangelistic
thrust. Also the rest of Galatians 3 keeps on developing the theme, that the Law
and the covenants point one to Christ, the One who justifies by faith.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham
might come to the Gentiles, so that we would receive the promise of the Spirit
through faith.&quot;  (Galatians 3:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Again the theme of our so great salvation is related to
the covenants of promise. Eph. 2:12-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; remember that you were at that time separate from
Christ, excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the
covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. But now in
Christ Jesus you who formerly were far off have been brought near by the blood
of Christ.&quot;  (Ephesians 2:12-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Book of Hebrews mentions the word “covenant” more
than any other New Testament book. A contrast is made between the Mosaic
Covenant and the New Covenant. A study of the great theme of salvation and
growth after salvation is emphasized. Heb. 8:6 – Heb. 10:39.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Revelation 22 is the last chapter in the Bible and extends
an invitation to partake of the water of life freely, that is, accept Jesus
Christ as personal Savior. As one glances through the context, mention is made
of the Davidic Covenant. Again impressed upon the understanding student is the
fact of evangelism. Rev. 22:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;I, Jesus, have sent My angel to testify to you
these things for the churches. I am the root and the descendant of David, the
bright morning star.&quot; &quot;  (Revelation 22:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>A Last Word</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The theme of promise runs throughout this entire lesson
series. The key to blessing is to claim the promise of salvation through faith
in Christ Jesus, then to keep on claiming the promises by faith after
salvation. Our desire is to see evangelism of the teaching variety reach lost
souls, and then these new believers built up in the faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Although this manual is designed primarily for the
teacher, they can be given to the pupils in the class and used for a textbook.
May God richly bless you in the spirit of Ephesians 3:20-21 as you study to
show yourself approved unto God.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly beyond
all that we ask or think, according to the power that works within us, to Him
be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and
ever. Amen.&quot;  (Ephesians 3:20-21, NASB)</p>
