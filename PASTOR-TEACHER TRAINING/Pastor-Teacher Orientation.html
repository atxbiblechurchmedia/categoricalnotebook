<h2>Pastor-Teacher Orientation</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Your Personal Bible Study </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Daily you must transfer of the Bible doctrine that has
been taught. You must understand what is being taught. If you don’t understand,
use patience and faith-rest and put it on the backburner. If the Bible doctrine
learned is not transferred to the right lobe of the soul by faith-belief in Bible
class, make sure to transfer that doctrine you understand before the sun goes
down.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Daily reading for factual information is no problem. For
example, you may be reading from the Bible in any area. You will profit in
direct proportion to your frame of reference. Daily reading to your children is
no problem. Having a daily time of prayer and Bible reading and study is no
problem. But realize that this does not fulfill the grace apparatus for
perception for the day.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher teaches the Word. Word of God is taken
into the mind. By faith the understood Word is transferred to the right lobe of
the soul. Through the continued use of faith (positive volition) and needed
application, the frame of reference is filled out. The edification complex of
the soul forms. The frame of reference, memory center, vocabulary (forming
categories) and conscience (norms and standards) form as you grow spiritually.
The most important part of every day is when the pastor-teacher teaches Bible
doctrine in public assembly, face to face with positive people.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Encouragement to Learn Bible Doctrine, Hebrew &amp;
Greek</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every language has an academic and application aspect.
Academic study is conducive to weariness of the flesh. In Ecclesiastes 12:12,
“wearying” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>יגעה</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>(yegi‛âh) and means to grasp, to be exhausted, to be bone tired, to be
faint, fatigued.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But beyond this, my son, be warned: the writing of many books
is endless, and excessive devotion to books is wearying to the body.”
(Ecclesiastes 12:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 12:3, “grow weary” is κάμνω (kamnō) and “lose
heart” is ἐκλύω (ekluō) and means to unloose as a bow string.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For consider Him who has endured such hostility by sinners
against Himself, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.” (Hebrews
12:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 11:27, “labor” is κόπος (kopos) and
means weariness, painful, to be weary because of hard work.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I have been in labor and hardship, through many sleepless
nights, in hunger and thirst, often without food, in cold and exposure.” (2
Corinthians 11:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Academic study, though necessary, is useless unless you
can get it over to application. Hebrew that has been taught must be shepherded
as an extension of the doctrine of verbal inspiration. In the pressures of life,
you will have the tendency to faint in your soul, not in your mind. In Hebrews
12:3, “heart” is ψυχή (psuchē) and refers to the right lobe of the soul or
heart.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For consider Him who has endured such hostility by sinners
against Himself, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.” (Hebrews
12:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Obviously the context is talking about fainting in the
chastening experience. Bitterness is representative of the whole out of
fellowship experience, but also in the understand suffering aspect. As an
adolescent believer under accelerated intake, plus the many details of life,
you have the responsibility of taking in doctrine on a daily basis. You have
the responsibility of taking care of you and your family on a daily basis –
food, shelter, and clothing.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Let’s say you have made a few foolish decisions. You
stayed out of fellowship long enough to get some scar tissue. And a sickness
comes along, a sick baby, an unexpected doctor bill. Let’s say you are not
getting Hebrew or Greek. You despair and want to drop out. No, there is no way
you can do that.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The answer when you sense the pressure is more than you
can bear is to lessen the details or pressure. To stop further academic pursuit
and switch in the class to simple application. To plan a very restful Saturday
with plenty of loafing or activity that especially relaxes you even if it does
cost money.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Check your priorities. Take a ten day period to break the
lust pattern that has developed. You have been at a fever pitch wanting a gun,
car, etc. But to do so you would have to spend money you do not have. Savings
accounts should be consistent with your debt.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You sublimate by getting beautiful colored literature, by
reading books, by getting demonstration rides, etc. accompanied by a terrific
mental battle to rationalize and to justify the expenditure. Stop all this
procedure! Discuss your problem with your superior. The adolescent believer
still has parents (his pastor, instructor).</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If our most faithful people are having problems with a
course of study, a doctrine, or pacing the difficulty may lie with the pastor
or instructor. There must be shepherding. When pressure exists and details are
lessened, no one who is faithful should take the readjustment personally.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Consistent Faithful Follow-through </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Consistent faithful follow-through in the classes is very
important when the pastor-teacher provides the discipline. Endure to the end. 2
Tim. 2:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The things which you have heard from me in the presence of
many witnesses, entrust these to faithful men who will be able to teach others
also.” (2 Timothy 2:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Faithfulness is finishing what you started under the
discipline and authority of your leader. Competence is the ability to reproduce
all that your communicator has taught you, plus spiritual self-sufficiency with
divine good production on your own. Teaching is the gift to communicate
everything you have learned from your communicators in your own personality
with confidence.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Consistent Faithfulness Under Training</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are to be consistently faithful silence as a faithful
“doulos” under training. We all talk too much. We promise more than we can
perform. Few can keep a confidence. Few can handle friendships. None can handle
service properly while in training. Illustration: Hezekiah in 2 Kings 20:12-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“At that time Berodach-baladan a son of Baladan, king of
Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he heard that Hezekiah had
been sick. Hezekiah listened to them, and showed them all his treasure house,
the silver and the gold and the spices and the precious oil and the house of
his armor and all that was found in his treasuries. There was nothing in his
house nor in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them.” (2 Kings
20:12-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A sick man is a target for sentimentality and
soft-headedness. He became vulnerable. It didn’t take much (letters and gifts) to
buy Hezekiah’s privacy and secrets. Always consider who sends the letters and
gifts. This is an enemy - Babylon men. An enemy is always an enemy, but Greeks
often bear gifts. There are certain things the public can never hear you talk
about.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Know to whom you are talking. Just because people are doctrinal
does not mean they are mature spiritually. Most men want to impress, to
confide, and to have your confidence. Trust God, distrust men until proven.
Deacons also have to prove themselves. 2 Kings 20:14; 1 Tim. 3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and said to him,
&quot;What did these men say, and from where have they come to you?&quot; And
Hezekiah said, &quot;They have come from a far country, from Babylon.&quot;” (2
Kings 20:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When called on the carpet, be truthful. Be responsible
for your actions and give a clear account. Be prepared for what you did wrong
in private to become public. Be prepared for the cycle of sin and its
repercussions. 2 Kings 20:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He said, &quot;What have they seen in your house?&quot; So
Hezekiah answered, &quot;They have seen all that is in my house; there is
nothing among my treasuries that I have not shown them.&quot;” (2 Kings 20:15,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Your enemy always has an advantage when he knows that you
have real wealth, gold, silver, and so on. He will want it and he will get it.
With plunder goes torture. The little Hezekiahs will be carried away to slavery.
2 Kings 20:16-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, &quot;Hear the word of the LORD.
'Behold, the days are coming when all that is in your house, and all that your
fathers have laid up in store to this day will be carried to Babylon; nothing
shall be left,' says the LORD.” (2 Kings 20:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Remember, this was the nice friendly Berodach-baladan. The
sweet, “nice to remember you” type. Upon realizing the truth, Hezekiah praised
the truth but the damage had been done. 2 Kings 20:18-19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“'Some of your sons who shall issue from you, whom you will
beget, will be taken away; and they will become officials in the palace of the
king of Babylon.'&quot; Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, &quot;The word of the
LORD which you have spoken is good.&quot; For he thought, &quot;Is it not so,
if there will be peace and truth in my days?&quot;” (2 Kings 20:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Consistent Patience is a Buffer</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Consistent patience is a buffer between positive and
negative volition. This rules out temper. There is no place for temper in the
Christian life either in your ministry or in your preparation.  This rules out
setting straight your communicator of Bible doctrine. He may be wrong and if he
is, he’ll take responsibility. But he should never take anything from you out
of fellowship. This rules out pitting the men who act as instructors here
against the pastor-teacher or vice versa. James 1; Hebrews 12.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>A Relaxed Home Life </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A relaxed home life as a prelude to orderliness in the
local church. 1 Tim. 3. That includes sexual satisfaction in marriage, sibling
satisfaction in marriage, and especially soul rapport and satisfaction in
marriage. 1 Cor. 7:1-9; 1 Tim. 3:4-5; 1 Tim. 3:12; 1 Peter 3:1-7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But because of immoralities, each man is to have his own wife,
and each woman is to have her own husband. The husband must fulfill his duty to
his wife, and likewise also the wife to her husband. The wife does not have
authority over her own body, but the husband does; and likewise also the
husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does. Stop
depriving one another, except by agreement for a time, so that you may devote
yourselves to prayer, and come together again so that Satan will not tempt you
because of your lack of self-control.” (1 Corinthians 7:2-5, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“He must be one who manages his own household well, keeping his
children under control with all dignity (but if a man does not know how to
manage his own household, how will he take care of the church of God?),” (1
Timothy 3:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Deacons must be husbands of only one wife, and good managers
of their children and their own households.” (1 Timothy 3:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“In the same way, you wives, be submissive to your own husbands
so that even if any of them are disobedient to the word, they may be won
without a word by the behavior of their wives,” (1 Peter 3:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“You husbands in the same way, live with your wives in an
understanding way, as with someone weaker, since she is a woman; and show her
honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life, so that your prayers will not be
hindered.” (1 Peter 3:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>A Fulfilling Study Life </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A fulfilling study life is an introduction to spiritual
prime of life production. Application of the doctrine of study. 2 Tim. 2:15.
Hit it especially hard the first six or nine weeks of school. This plants in
the teacher an image that you really mean business. Sit where you have maximum
concentration. Most do better in front. In back, you have to watch wiggling
people and look through all the distractions. A 3.0 student in front is often a
2.0 student in back.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman
who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth.” (2
Timothy 2:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Learn to listen. This is related to concentration. If the
teacher is dull, gut it out and be determined to get something out of it
anyway. Study each day and reviewing the material often. Go over each day’s
material that night. Don’t rely on cramming. Type up your notes. Learn to type
if you have not already. Typing is a most valuable and pragmatic ability. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Read the teacher. What does he stress in his class? Good
grammar or good taste. Does he mark down for sloppy work? ‘What is important to
him should be important to you. This is the principle of authority-orientation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Understand the basics in each class. Think systematically
in principle fashion. Greek, Hebrew, Isagogics, and Bible doctrine. All are
very necessary. Learn to express yourself in writing. That comes through
writing, writing, and more writing. Write letters. Put your whole heart into a
theme paper.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Learn how to express yourself verbally. Ask questions,
get involved in acting, debate, drama, regardless of the butterflies. Keep with
it even if it’s about to kill you. Learn how to take criticism. You don’t like
to be criticized, but face it, you are critical yourself aren’t you?</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Develop a sense of humor. Don’t take yourself so
seriously. Relax and don’t be so uptight. Commit your problems to the Lord. If
you have a low GPA, so what. Bring it up. Never give up. Have endurance and
stay with it. He that endures to the end shall be saved.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Develop your ability to read. Readers are leaders. How do
you develop that?? By reading. Read encyclopedias and dictionaries. Learn to
speed read.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Do the unpleasant things first and the things you like
last. Study an extra 15 or 30 minutes on a subject to really top it off. Your
bed time and leisure time determines your alert time the next day at school.
You can regulate your day any way you wish.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Dress in accordance with your mental attitude. Sloppy
dress makes for sloppy thinking. Learn to say “no” to outside activities. Keep
in contact with your communicators. Make wise financial decisions. You who have
communication gifts, limit the number of children you will have. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An unusual grasp of the basic structure of the Angelic
Conflict is an orientation to every doctrine in the Bible. Consistent timing in
accordance with the pace of the plan of God. The plan of God has as its
greatest enemy the program of Satan because both are absolutes. One is the best
the Godhead can do. The other is the best the old sin nature can do. Negative
volition actually has the audacity to challenge the positive volition on every
count. When a created individual says “I will” to the plan of God, he says “I
won’t” to the program of Satan. When he says “I will” to the program of Satan,
he says - “I won’t” to the plan of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The plan of God must have timing in chronology, yet let
volition function without coercion. Volition has a time to stay negative, stay
positive, or to vacillate between the two. God expresses timing in
administrations (Gentiles, Jews, the Church, Kingdom). </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ecclesiastes 3:1-8, “appointed time” is <span lang=HE
dir=RTL>זמן</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(zemân)
and means an appointed season, time, or occasion. There is a time for birth and
death, planting and harvesting, killing and healing (rehabilitation), breaking
down and building up, weeping and laughing, mourning and dancing, throwing
stones and gathering stones, embracing and not embracing, to get and to lose, to
keep and discard, to rip and to sew, to be silent and to talk, to love and to
hate, and war and peace. </p>

<p class=Verses>“There is an appointed time for everything. And there is a time
for every event under heaven— A time to give birth and a time to die; A time to
plant and a time to uproot what is planted. A time to kill and a time to heal;
A time to tear down and a time to build up. A time to weep and a time to laugh;
A time to mourn and a time to dance. A time to throw stones and a time to
gather stones; A time to embrace and a time to shun embracing. A time to search
and a time to give up as lost; A time to keep and a time to throw away. A time
to tear apart and a time to sew together; A time to be silent and a time to
speak. A time to love and a time to hate; A time for war and a time for peace.”
(Ecclesiastes 3:1-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Regarding phases, there is salvation, then the Christian way
of life, then eternity. Regarding the order or resurrection, Christ was the
first fruits, then the Church Age believers, then the Old Testament and
Tribulation saints, then the Millennial saints. 1 Cor. 15:23; Rev. 11:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, after that
those who are Christ's at His coming,” (1 Corinthians 15:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;And the nations were enraged, and Your wrath came, and
the time came for the dead to be judged, and the time to reward Your
bond-servants the prophets and the saints and those who fear Your name, the
small and the great, and to destroy those who destroy the earth.&quot;”
(Revelation 11:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Regarding stages, there are the stages of the Grace
Apparatus for Perception where believed Bible doctrine is converted by the Holy
Spirit from <i>gnosis</i> in the left lobe to <i>epignosis</i> in the right
lobe or heart. Regarding spiritual growth, there is the babe, adolescent, and
mature believer. 1 John 2:12ff.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I am writing to you, little children, because your sins have
been forgiven you for His name's sake. I am writing to you, fathers, because
you know Him who has been from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men,
because you have overcome the evil one. I have written to you, children,
because you know the Father.” (1 John 2:12-13, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“Do not love the world nor the things in the world. If anyone
loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the
world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of
life, is not from the Father, but is from the world. The world is passing away,
and also its lusts; but the one who does the will of God lives forever.” (1
John 2:15-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan expresses his program as a twist of God’s plan.
Knowing God’s plan, he always jumps the gun. To throw God’s timing off, Satan
attacks the Canon of Scripture -  the doctrine of verbal inspiration. Gen. 3.
He attacks communication with a pseudo canon. He attacks the family through
generation attacks and the humanity attack as in Genesis 4 with the murder of
Abel, and a pseudo crucifixion. He attacks the humanity of Christ with a pseudo
virgin birth attack. Gen. 6. He attacks the humanity of Christ with a pseudo
Christian way of life attack. Gen. 9.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan attacks the Divine Institutions with a concentrated
pseudo Millennium or the Millennium before its time. Gen. 11.  Satan’s plan of
God attacks include his pseudo plans. Gen. 12:10-20; Gen. 16; Gen. 20. Satan’s
plan of God attacks also include a pseudo kingdom and a pseudo ruler. 2 Thess.
2; Rev. 6-19. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Short and Long Range Goals</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You should have both short and long range will of God
goals and the will and discipline to meet them. Short range goals should
include daily goals - stay in fellowship, attend Bible class, pass your tests
in accordance with your spiritual growth level, and immediate proper response
to authority. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Long range goals must include reaching spiritual maturity
and resulting exercise of your spiritual gift in spiritual prime of life
production. You should have a proper identification in the divine institutions,
know the boundaries of your freedom, and identify your opposite number for
marriage. You should also know well the generation teachings of Scripture
(family), political orientation, and avoidance of reversionism. You should pass
all of the tests God send your way to accelerate your spiritual growth including
