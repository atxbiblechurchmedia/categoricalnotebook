<h2><a name="_The_Academic_Study"></a>The Academic Study Process</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Necessity for the Categorical Ministry</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The basis and content of this study is found today in the
need of men who are entering or about to enter the Categorical ministry which
emphasizes the ICE type of communication of Bible doctrine. ICE teaching refers
to 3 things, or ingredients necessary to the Categorical ministry, they are:
Isagogics, Categories, and Exegesis.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>However, an understanding of this is not to say that a
man is capable of doing this in his own ministry. It is imperative to establish
men in the mechanics and processes necessary to the production of an ICE
ministry. To begin this process, the author attempts to set forth in a very
practical way the mechanics of study pertinent to the production of ICE
teaching.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To accomplish the objective of the above, one must show
from the Scriptures themselves the development and expression of the processes
described. This will be done with the book of Galatians. This study is not
designed to be an Exegetical and applied study of the book of Galatians, but
rather an example of the techniques utilized in the Academic Process of
Categorical study. In view of this, much truth and many truths probably very
obvious may be omitted. An understanding of this principle of procedure by the
author is imperative to a correct appreciation of this study.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It should be further stated that the author himself is
not writing from a theoretical standpoint of one who has not tried and proved
the methods and processes herein contained. It is from the very exercise of
these processes as done on a daily study and teaching basis that the procedures
are workable and necessary to correct ICE teaching.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Many of the concepts herein contained are in themselves
due to the teaching of other faithful and sound men who have been diligent in
imparting them. The full coordination of procedural techniques of study and
presentations suits well to the gift of teaching or instructing of the author.
It is recognized that human abilities or credentials are not the issue, but
rather the non-meritorious spiritual gift function is that which brings honor
and glory to Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>With these principles of introduction in mind, the task
of setting this process in motion will begin. Diligence in mastering the
techniques is imperative to an enjoyment of the process of study and the fruits
of communication.</p>

href="#_Translation_Factor">Translation Factor</a></i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The emphasis in this study is on the “how” of the
Academic Study Process rather than the complete content of the book of
Galatians. Some sections will have much more actual content while other
sections will emphasize those areas which are necessary to search to derive the
content.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the first section, the Hermeneutical Process will
emphasize principles that you must follow to correctly interpret the Scripture.
The second section emphasizes the Process of deriving the Isagogical needs of
the passage with the accompanying procedures. In the third phase of the
Academic Study Process, one actually gets into the text of Scripture and
analyzes the content from a Sequential standpoint. In the fourth phase, the
various and sundry doctrines of Scripture are recognized and identified. This
identification process is not to be confused with Exegesis, nor is it to be
understood as expressing the Categorical Identification process. The next order
of business of the student is what we will cover under the Identification of
Categories. By this we mean the recognition of actual categories in a passage,
either existing within a passage by having a number of its own parts there, or
by recognizing that a given specific doctrine in the passage is a part of a
broader category taught elsewhere in the Scripture. An example of the last
statement would be having the doctrine of sovereignty in a passage but
recognizing that this belongs to a broad doctrinal category of the essence of
God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Having thoroughly expended the first five features of the
Academic Process, the student is now ready for the actual translation of the
book. This is done by giving the regular significance to the etymology of the
words, the tense meanings, the case functions, etc. Once the rough and smooth
translation has been made, the exegesis and application becomes the objective.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Exegesis then is deriving the actual doctrinal
interpretation and the application of that interpretation by a close scrutiny
of all the specific grammatical, hermeneutical, isagogical, etymological, and
chronological data available to the student. Exegesis is concerned with all the
shades of tense meaning, case functions, sentence structure, idioms, figures of
speech, and all things that would reveal the clear precise meaning of the text.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<h3><a name="_The_Hermeneutical_Process"></a>The Hermeneutical Process and
Principles of Study</h3>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>A Categorical Look at Hermeneutics</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Before one is able to effectively communicate the Word of
God categorically and doctrinally, one must first gain facility in categorical
study. Categorical study will express itself in categorical presentation. Since
doctrine is built on doctrine, it is necessary to show relationships between
bodies of truth which all fit into as a basic framework or body called a
Category. The following sets forth the basic considerations to a study of
Categorical Hermeneutics.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Categorical Dispensational Fix of the Passage</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In which of the four Categorical Dispensations does the
passage fall?</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Dispensation of
the Gentile: Gen. 1:1 - Gen. 11</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Dispensation of
the Jew: Gen. 12 - John, Rev. 6-19</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Dispensation of
the Church: Acts 2 - Rev. 5</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Dispensation of
Christ: Rev. 20-22</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Historical Context of the Book: Categorically arranged</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Isagogics of
the Book: Historical events surrounding the book </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Chronology of
the Book: (including its structure)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Major Doctrines
of the Book: Categorized</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The information derived under the Categorical
Dispensational Fix of the Passage and the applicable Categorical Dispensation will
provide the content and context for the Historical Context of the Book.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>General Context of Surrounding Passages: This is done in
basically two ways. The following points state these two ways. They will be
expanded later as will be the case for each Categorical procedure. Recognize
all major Areas of Doctrine of the surrounding passage. Example: if you are
studying John 13, the major doctrinal divisions and areas should be known of
chapters fore and aft.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Secondly, classify the major Doctrines into the
Categories to which they belong. Therefore, before getting to your main passage
under consideration you have determined what dispensation is related, all major
areas of doctrines treated, and the Categories in which these doctrines rest.
You have now arrived at a Categorical Context of Surrounding passages for your
main passage. The next procedure is much similar to this one, but with a more
narrow scope.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Immediate Context of the Passage: Categorically studied.
It should be stated at this time that we are discussing the procedures of
Categorical study methods, not Categorical presentation. The immediate context
of the passage would be treated in much the same way as the surrounding
passages were. The doctrines are recognized and categorized. Then the various
categories of doctrines are listed. Each category in the passage is viewed as a
part of the whole context.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Example: the surrounding context of John 13 could contain
15 areas of doctrine, which in turn would be grouped into 3 categories of
doctrines. Of these 3 categories, possibly only 2 categories may be found in
the immediate context of John 13. Now, one is ready to step into the final
stages of Categorical studies.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Categorical Development within the Passage: This is done
in many steps. Each Category in a passage is thoroughly developed in accordance
with all the foregoing principles. Suppose a passage could be broken down into
3 categories doctrinally: spiritual gifts, Christian maturity, evangelism. Then
the student would take each Category and develop it in the following method.
This method will be developed by example in following sections. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Following the Categorical analysis of the passage in all
the Categories, the student then makes a Categorical Summary of the passage.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Categorical Hermeneutics Demonstrated</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The passage of Scripture we will use to demonstrate the
Categorical method of study will be the famous and often improperly explained
Sermon on the Mount, Mat. 5-7. The following in outline form will serve as a
sample of how a Categorical study develops and climaxes. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Dispensational Fix on the Passage </i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>During Which Categorical Dispensation does Mat. 5-7
fall?  You have 4 distinct Dispensations or Administrations of time. (Gentile,
Gen. 1-11; Jew, Gen 12-end of the Gospels, Rev. 6-19; Church, Acts 2-end of
Rev. 5; Christ, Rev. 20). These administrations of time get their names from
the person or group who administrates them. The Book of Matthew falls within
the Jewish dispensation. Therefore, it is subject to all the doctrines which
relate to that dispensation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To What Dispensation do the Doctrinal Points contained
refer? They must be understood in light of the Jewish Dispensation in which
they are given, and they must be understood in light of the Kingdom (Christ)
Dispensation to which they refer.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Conclusion: The dispensation in which a passage occurs
provides the Basic Frame of Reference for interpretation of the passage. The
dispensation to which the passage refers provides the Scope and Limitation
regarding the Application of the passage, to other dispensations. To apply a
principle occurring in one dispensation to another dispensation, one must be
sure that you have a parallel analogy. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Example: True: Salvation in the Church, by faith in
Christ is the same in the dispensation of the Jews. False: Universal indwelling
of believers in the Church Age, but no universal indwelling in Jewish
Dispensation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Extreme care must be used with objective study to guard
against reading into the passage a parallel meaning from another dispensational
context.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Historical Fix on the Passage</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Isagogics of the book: Written by a Jewish tax collector.
Relates Christ to the Jewish nation. Relates Christ to God’s program for Israel
and the Jews. Presents Christ as the Messiah and King of Israel.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>General Context of the Surrounding Passages</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew, the context that precedes Matthew 5-7 is the
birth and genealogy of the King, the virgin birth of Jesus Christ, and the
Jewish lineage of Christ. In Matthew 3, there is the Baptism and identification
of the King and our Lord being identified with John the Baptist as the herald
of the Messiah’s coming. Also in Matthew 3, the temptation of the King occurs.
The adequate earthly King must be perfect deity and true humanity in one
person. The King is now prepared.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 8-9, the context that follows Matthew 5-7 is
the King the Messiah is verified by His actions, i.e., miracles. In Matthew
10-11, the King must also have a cabinet, so He chooses His disciples. His
disciples bring the Gospel of the Kingdom. In Matthew 12, the King is presented
to religious authorities and is completely rejected. The King has now been
organized, staffed, presented, and has been rejected. All that is missing is
the Kingdom Message of the King. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At this point, the student is ready to analyze carefully
the major doctrines of the specific passage, Matthew 5-7. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Now, suppose for illustration purposes, that you are
going to teach a certain more specific passage within the Sermon on the Mount,
such as, Matthew 5:1-12, commonly called the Beatitudes. The specific doctrine
is expressed is the Categorical Doctrine of Happiness.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Categorical Summary of the Doctrine of Happiness</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All points of
doctrine are gathered from Matthew 5:1-12 concerning Happiness. Secondly, the
Doctrine of Happiness from this passage is supplemented by other points of
Doctrine of Happiness from other passages and other dispensations. Thirdly,
those are united into a body of truth all relating to the Doctrine of
Happiness. These points of doctrine, now accumulated from many sources,
including that which is before you, are categorized by dispensation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>General points
relating to Happiness which carry from dispensation to dispensation are
applicable (usually) to all dispensations. (Salvation by faith, as an example.)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The specific
points relating to Happiness which are particular to a “certain given
Dispensation” are limited in application to that dispensation unless there is a
“comparative analogy” to it within another dispensation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Therefore, in conclusion the Categorical Method of Study
insures the accuracy of Interpretation and also the accuracy of application.
The passage you have studied has yielded certain Interpretation, and certain
points of application; therefore making its particular contribution to the
Whole of the Category of Happiness. See category on <a href="#_Inner_Happiness">Happiness</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Categorical Hermeneutics Clarified:</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It could possibly be asked, “What is the difference
between Topical Study, Doctrinal Subject Study, and Categorical Study?” When
one examines the methods, the differences become obvious. First, Categorical
Study depends on a Categorical Frame of Reference communicated by a
Pastor-Teacher. It is impossible to correctly study on your own many things
that require an exposition by a Pastor-Teacher.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Secondly, regular topical and even doctrinally-oriented
subjects in study form draw upon books and sources which do not convey a total
frame of reference which the write may or may not have. Often that which is
written is done so by men who themselves make no Categorical distinctions, such
as Dispensational breakdowns.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Therefore, your source material is a composite of details
taken from many contexts divorced from their Doctrinal Categories and then
hopefully assimilated into some sort of workable whole, capable of presentation
without confusing everyone.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An example might help to illustrate this: Take the
doctrine or subject of Love. To treat the doctrine of love topically or as a
subject even for a series of messages, it would be done along these lines
usually by the student. Information would be gathered about love, quantities of
details (properly or improperly arrived at) and massed. Then they are sorted
and grouped in study along the lines which the speaker wants to communicate
usually with their application in view. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is one of the greatest dangers in a simple doctrinal
study, or topical study. So far, the speaker has cast his material into a
Subjective mold and from this point he can with ease pursue his Subjective
course. Therefore, the Subjective purpose of the speaker becomes the Frame of
Reference for the materials and guides the man in his application. Whereas, the
proper application of Scripture arises simply out of the clear expression of
teaching doctrine objectively within a categorical framework.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>On the other hand, a categorical study of Love:
Recognizes all the details of the doctrines relating to love. Recognizes the
Categories into which the details fall, relating the proper detail to the
proper Category. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Example: The doctrine that states we are to “Love One
Another” relates to <i>agape</i> love. Agape love is a mental attitude love.
Soul love, including various facets of the soul relate to <i>phileo</i>.  One
can easily see that if the teaching concerning total soul expression love and
mental attitude love are taught and applied without consideration for the
Categories within which they fall, disaster can be the result when attempting
to apply these points.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Principles of Interpretation Governing Categorical
Hermeneutics</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Bible must be its own interpreter, that is, Scripture
must be explained with Scripture. One portion of the Word of God will explain
something necessary to understand another portion of Scripture. The Scripture
must be taken in its usual and ordinary sense, in English, unless the original
text would indicate a different meaning.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is necessary to take the words in the sense which the
whole sentence indicates. We often call this the Immediate Context. This is
true in both English, Greek, and Hebrew. It is necessary to take the words in
the sense indicated by the context of verses preceding and following it. We
often call this the Surrounding Context. An example of the progression thus
far: (1 Cor. 9).</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Rule 2: Paul uses the term “free” or “liberty.” Rule 2
says to take this in the normal or ordinary sense. Here, the Greek doesn’t
change it, but specifies it and makes it more specific.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Rule 3: Identifies the Immediate context of liberty as it
relates to Paul’s liberty as an apostle, within the confines of the Law of
Supreme Sacrifice, which comes out of Rule 4, the rule of Surrounding Context.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is necessary to know the object or purpose of the
writer in the writing of the book in which your passage lies. It is necessary
to consult parallel passages. This is the concept of Categorical
Summarizations. In other words, the doctrine or truth within your passage will
be more clear if you study other passages that relate to it, develop it, and
show different phases of it. These parallel passages in the realm of
interpretation, when combined, will give you a total concept of the teaching of
the Scripture on the doctrine that is found in your passage.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are many ways to consult parallel passages. Here
are a few. There can be passages which use the <u>same</u> Greek or Hebrew
term, but in <u>different</u> contexts. This will give you the spectrum of the
use of the term. Examples are: </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>αγαπάω </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 John 4:10, Term: Love, Context: God’s plan of
salvation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mat. 5:43-44, Term: Love, Context: Believer’s
responsibility to enemies.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 Jn. 2:15, Term: Love, Context: Believer’s liability to
worldliness.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jn. 3:19, Term: Love, Context: Unbelievers expressing
negative volition to the Gospel of Light.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There can be passages which use the <u>same</u> Greek or
Hebrew term in the <u>same</u> context. Examples are: </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>αγάπη </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Gal. 5:22: Love is seen as the production of the believer
in contrast to the production of the Old Sin Nature. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 Jn. 2:10: Love is seen as the production of the
believer in fellowship, contrasted to hating the other person being out of
fellowship, under the control of the Old Sin Nature.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>2 Tim. 1:7: Love is seen as the production of Spirit
control of the believer and is set against the “fear” concept of the Old Sin
Nature control. The believer is in view in both respects here.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There may be passages which use <u>different</u> Greek or
Hebrew terms but in the <u>same</u> contexts. Examples are:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>ποιμαίνω: 1 Pet. 5:1-5: Context: Building up believers
by the Shepherd. Also επισκοπούντες.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>βόσκω: John 21:15-17: Context: Building up Believers by
the Shepherd. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>ποιμήν: John 21:16.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>βόσκω: John 21:17.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>ερριζώμενος:  Eph. 3:13-21: Context: Building up
believers by their Shepherd. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>γνώναι: (rooted). καταλαβέσθαι: (comprehended). τεθεμελιωμένοι:
(grounded). </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>πληρωθήτε: (filled). κραταιωθήναι: (strengthened).</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scripture Reference: Acts 5:1-11. Context: Giving by the
people of the local church.  English terms: “kept back,” “privy,” “Satan filled
thine heart,” “lie to the Holy Spirit,” “was it not in thine own power,”
“conceived in thine heart,” and “lied. ...unto God.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scripture Reference: 1 Cor. 9:7-18. Context: Giving by
people of the local church. English terms: “at his own charges,” “eateth not
the fruit thereof,” “not muzzle the mouth of the ox,” “reap your carnal
things,” “live....of the temple,” and “live of the Gospel.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scripture Reference: 2 Cor. 8:1-24 Giving by the people
of the local church. English terms: “deep poverty,” “abundance of joy,” “beyond
their power,” “willing of themselves,” “gave their own selves,” “finish, the
same grace,” “abound in this grace also,” “prove the sincerity of your love,”
“perform the doing of it,” “readiness to will,” “performance also out of that
which ye have,” “first....a willing mind,” “by an equality!,” “your
abundance....your want,” “equality,” “nothing over....no lack,” “administered
by us,” and “proof of your love.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scripture Reference: 2 Cor. 9:1-15. Context: Giving by
the people of the local church. English terms: “make up beforehand your
bounty,’’ “sow sparingly....reap sparingly,” “sow bountifully....reap
bountifully,” “every man,” “purposeth in his heart,” “not grudgingly, or of
necessity,” “God is able....grace to abound,” “having all sufficiency,” “abound
to every good work,” “disperse abroad,” “seed to the sower,” “bread for your
food,” “multiply your good move,” “enriched in everything,” “supplieth the want
of the saints,” and “liberal distribution to them.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are passages that will give the same idea or truth
cast in different contexts. This will indicate the phases or categories related
to the idea or truth of your passage. Examples are.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scripture Reference: 2 Cor. 12:13. Subject is giving in
the local church, but the context is that of the dealing of the Apostle with
the local church. English terms: “you were made inferior,” “not burdensome,”
and “forgive me this wrong.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scripture Reference: 2 Cor. 11:7-12. Subject is giving in
the local church, but the context is the dealing of the Apostle with the local
church. This is parallel in both respects with the previous example. English
terms: “I robbed other churches,” “taking wages,” “chargeable to no man,” “being
burdensome to you,” “what I do, that I will do,” “cut off occasion,” “those who
desire occasion,” “they glory,” and “found even as we.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scripture Reference: 1 Tim. 5:17-18. Subject or idea is
that of giving and supporting the communicator in and by the local church, but
the context, is the responsibilities of the pastor to the local church. This is
the context of the whole chapter. This would then agree with the idea or truth
of living in the above parallel passages, but would be cast into a different
context. English terms: “elders that rule well,” “counted worthy,” “double
honor,” “they who labor,” “in word and doctrine,” “muzzle the ox,” “treadeth
out the grain,” and “laborer is worthy of his reward.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scripture Reference: Mat. 6:1-6. Subject or idea is that
of giving, but the context is that of the wrong approach in a spiritual
ministry or production. English terms: “alms before men,” “to be seen of men,”
“no reward,” “do not sound a trumpet,” “glory of men,” “they have their reward,”
and “alms may be in secret.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scripture Reference: Rom. 12:8. The subject or idea is
that of giving, but the context is that of the spiritual gifts and their
production. English terms: “he that giveth” and “do it with simplicity.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The literal or usual interpretation of the Scripture may
be figurative as well as just exactly what it says. By literal we mean the
normal way it should be interpreted. With respect to figurative usages in the
text, there are many. Some are Greek, some English, and some are Hebrew. One
must always remember that there is some likeness, or equality between the two
things, persons, or facts which justifies the comparison or the use of the
figure.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>One of the Classes of Figures of Speech are the
Rhetorical Figures.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Metaphor: this is basically some similarity between two
objects or things or beings. The one is characterized by what is true of the
others: 1 Cor. 3:9; Luke 13:32; John 10:9.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Synechdoche: this is the figure used when the part is put
for the whole or the whole for a part. Acts 27:37; 1 Cor. 11:27.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Metonomy: this is the figure which puts the cause for the
effect or the sign for the reality. Luke 16:29; 1 John 1:7.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Personification: this is a figure which personifies
inanimate things, attributing them to doing or acting as people. Psalms 85:10;
1 Cor. 15:55.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Irony: this figure expresses the opposite of the real
thought that one is expressing, but in such a way that the meaning is clear.
Job 12:2.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Hyperbole: this is a figure that presents something as
much bigger or much smaller than it really is to make it more vivid to the
imagination. Numbers 13:33.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Allegory: an allegory is a number of metaphors brought
together in one story, each conveying a corresponding reality. John 6:51-63. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Fable: this is historical allegory, seldom found in
Scripture, and in which a deed or incident is stated in a narrative form by
means of personification of things or of animals. 2 Kings 14:9.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Riddle: this is a statement that is “purposely obscure in
order to test the sharpness of those who attempt to solve it.” Judges 14:14.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Type: it is a kind of metaphor of deeds, persons or
objects which have corresponding deeds, persons or objects. John 3:14.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Symbol: a symbol is a kind of type which some thing or
deed is represented by some other thing which is well-known and appropriate as
a likeness. horn--power; keys--access; lion--royalty; gold---wealth.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Parable: a kind of allegory in the form of narration,
expressing natural or possible happenings, for the main purpose of illustrating
one or more truths or objects.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Hebraisms </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>These are certain expressions peculiar to the Hebrew and
translated into our English texts. One Hebrew idiom is the calling of a person
“the son or child of a thing” that characterizes him. Matt. 23:15; Eph. 5:8;
Luke 10:6. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The practice of making a comparison by negation: Acts
5:4. The practice of mentioning or referring to several various things because
they relate to the one particular person or thing in question. Gen. 8:4.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The practice of referring to the descendants by referring
to the father. Gen. 9:25; Gen. 49:7. The word son is used to denote a
descendant more or less remote. Brother was often used when a relative was
meant.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Near Hebraisms</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>These are certain expressions which relate to numbers,
actions, and names. Certain numbers are given to indicate Indeterminate
Numbers: Ten is used to indicate the sense of several. Forty is used to express
the idea of many. Seven and seventy is used to express a Large Indeterminate
Number. Round numbers are used for exact numbers: 300 for 293. Judges 20:35;
Judges 20:46. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Certain Hebraisms expressing actions: This is used when
the text says that a person did a thing, when actually he caused it to be done
or declared it to be done, etc. Lev. 14:11; John 4:1-2. This is used when a
command appears not even with the consent idea, but a mere permission. Ezekiel
20:39. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Certain names are given to indicate more than one person:
Pharaoh; herods; Benhadad, kings of Damascus; Agag, kings of the Amalekites;
Caesar, title of the Roman emperor. A name which designates a person or place:
Magog is son of Japheth, and the name of the land occupied by Gog. Ezel. 38.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One person or place having more than one name:
Levi-Matthew; Thomas-Didymus; Thaddaeus and Labbaeus-Judas (not Iscariot);
Horeb-Sinai, different peaks of the same mountain; Lake of Gennesaret,
Chinnereth, Chinneroth-Sea of Galilee, Tiberias; Ethiopia-Cush; Egypt-Ham;
Greece-Javan; Egypt-Rehab; Dead Sea-Sea of the Plain, Salt Sea, East Sea.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Figures of Speech Peculiar to the Greek Language</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ellipsis: This figure is a specific form used in a
sentence where words or a word is omitted; words which are necessary to
grammar, but not necessary for the sense. This serves to arrest our attention</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Absolute Ellipsis: The omitted word or words are supplied
from the nature of the subject alone.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Relative Ellipsis: The omitted word or words are supplied
from the context of the passage.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ellipsis of Repetition: The omitted words are supplied by
repeating them from a previous clause or sentence.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>False Ellipsis: This is the supplying of words into the
Original text when it is translated as an Ellipsis where an Ellipsis is not
warranted. Thus this constitutes an addition that does not belong there.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Zeugma: or Unequal Yoke: This is a figure where one verb
is yoked to two subjects or two objects. This places the remaining verb in
emphasis and takes our attention from the one omitted.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Asyndeton: This is a figure that means “without
conjunction.” Thus phrases, sentences, etc. are coupled together without
conjunctions so that they can be moved over rapidly, to get to the climax where
the emphasis is to be put. It is the opposite of the polysyndeton. 1 Cor.
3:12-13</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Apharesis: A figure of etymology which relates to the
spelling of words and is used of the cutting off of a letter or syllable from
the beginning of a word.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Apocope: A figure of etymology which relates to the
spelling of words and is used of the cutting off of a letter or syllable from
the end of the word.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Aposiopesis: The figure of speech by which the normal
flow of the sentence is broken off, to give emphasis to that which is to
follow, a very dramatic utterance.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Meiosis: This figure of one thing is diminished in order
to increase another thing. The purpose is to emphasize or call attention to the
thing increased and not to the thing diminished.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Tapeinosis: This is a figure which increases a thing by
lessening it.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Syllogismus: This figure is reckoning together: that is,
three premises and a conclusion based on the validity and sequence of premises.
Conclusion is to be supplied.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Enthymema: This figure is like the Syllogism but here the
conclusion is stated and one of the premises is missing.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Homoeopropheron: Successive words which carry the same
syllable or letter at the beginning.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Homoeoteleuton: Successive words which carry the same
syllable or letter at the end of a word.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Homoeoptoton: The figure where there is a repetition of
Inflection in the successive words. The endings of the words are usually the
same and derive this similarity from their unifying inflection.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paromoeosis: This figure repeats the inflection of words
which are similar in sounds. This would be as for example: the verb endings of
two verbs of the same voice, mood, tense, and number: “sasthe” and “sasthe”.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Acrostichion: The figure which repeats the same or
successive letters at the beginning of words or clauses. The purpose is to draw
attention to the special character of this passage.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Epizeuxis: This figure is the repetition of the same word
in the same sense in the same sentence. This is done to emphasize the meaning
of the word.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Anaphora: This figure Repeats the same word at the
beginning of successive sentences. This is done for emphasis.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Epanalepsis: This figure is the Repetition of the same
word or phrase after a parenthesis. Example: “For this cause....for this
cause....”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Polysyndeton: This figure is the Repetition of the word
“and” at the beginning of successive clauses. This is used to call attention to
each segment rather than just passing over them to get to the climax.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paradiastole: This figure repeats Disjunctives,
Neither-Nor; and Either-Or; and its purpose again is to call attention to and
emphasize.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Epistrophe: This figure repeats the same word or words at
the end of the successive sentence. The figure may appear to be in the English
but a checking of the Greek may prove different. There may be the same word
repeated in the English but two different words may be employed by the Greek or
Hebrew.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Epanadiplosis: The repetition of the same word or words
at the beginning and end of the sentence: Emphasizes that what is said is
complete, calls attention to the solemnity of the passage.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Epadiplosis: This is the figure where the repetition of
the same words at the beginning and the end of the sentence is repeated with
successive sentences.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Anadiplosis: The repetition of the same word at the end
of a sentence and at the beginning of the next one. Emphasizes the one
repeated, excludes the one omitted.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Climax: This is a figure which is a continual
Anadiplosis, with the last word of a sentence repeated as the first of the
next, and continuing in this procedure through several successive sentences.
Emphasizes a graduation upwards.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mesarchia: The repetition of the same word or words at
the beginning and middle of successive sentences.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mesodiplosis: The repetition of the same word or words in
the middle of successive sentences.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mesoteleuton: The repetition of the same word or words in
the middle and at the end of the sentence.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Repetition: Repetition of the same word or words
irregularly in the same passage to give force and call attention.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Polyptoton: The repetition of the same part of speech in
different inflections. Example: using the same noun but in several cases, or
same verb in several moods.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Antanaclasis: Repetition of the same word in a sentence
in a Different Sense. “The more I think of it, the less I think of it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ploce: The repetition of the same word in the sentence in
which the second is a stronger sense or implies more than the first one.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Synoeceiosis: The repetition of the same word in the same
sentence with an extended meaning.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Syllepsis: The repetition of the Sense without the
Repetition of the word. “Rend your heart, and not your garments.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Symploce: The repetition of different words in successive
sentences in the same order and the same sense. Old Testament illustration of
this would be in Isaiah 65:13 in the Hebrew.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Epanados: The repetition of the same words in an inverse
order but the same sense: Shem, Ham, Japeth; Japeth, Ham, Shem</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Rhetorical Question</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A rhetorical question is one that is designed to get an
effect, not an answer. Gen. 18:25; Rom. 8:33-35; Heb. 1:14.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Antithesis</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is a sentence structure figure of setting one part
of the sentence against another part of the sentence. Matt. 7:13-14; Rom. 6:23.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Climax</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is the figure of a series of related ideas, each
becoming more intensive than the preceding ones. Rom. 8:15-17; Rom. 8:29-30.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Proverb</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The proverb is a common saying or adage which is either
set forth as a Point of Doctrine or used to make a Point of Doctrine. John
10:6; Luke 4:23.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Paradox</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“A statement or proposition seemingly self-contradictory
or abstruse, and yet explicable as expressing a truth... an opinion or
statement contrary to received opinion.” American Col. Dictionary. Used in
Matt. 8:22; Luke 9:60; Mark 8:35.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Logic and the Scriptures</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This section will be treated as a separate facet of
Hermeneutical understanding. It involves the rational thought processes
accompanying the proper expression of Hermeneutical principles. Therefore, we
will deal with it in the following manner:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Definition by Dr. L. S. Chafer: “Logic is the science of
the principles which govern correct thinking and sound reasoning.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are Four Fundamental Principles of Logic.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>The Law of
Identity or Affirmation. “If white is white, then we may affirm it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>The Law of
Contradiction or Negation. “If white is not black, then we may affirm it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>The Low of
Excluded Middle or Exclusion. “Of two opposing things, if one is affirmed then
the other must be denied.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>The Law of
Sufficient Reason: “Nothing exists which does not have sufficient reason to
exist.” This is the cause and effect concept.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are two basic premises of Logic:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“There is such a thing as Truth, which when found, and on
which all minds, acting in harmony with the laws of thought, must agree.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Thoughts can be stated explicitly in language.” Language
is reliable to communicate the truth of thoughts.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The purpose of the study of Interpretation is to discover
and gain proficiency in the science of extracting the complete and connected
thoughts of God as expressed in the Word of God, the Bible. This includes Greek
and Hebrew Grammar, figure, symbols, rhetorical types of expression, isagogics
and background, inherent contexts, logic and reasoning with natural thought
process coupled with the divine enablement of the faith perception system of 1
Corinthians 2 and Romans 10:17.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>An Overview of the Study of Hermeneutics in Conclusion</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We have seen that the major factors following must be
considered in the process of rightly interpreting the Word of God. Recognition
of the basic encompassing truth that the Bible must be its own Interpreter. The
Scripture must be taken in its usual or ordinary sense, unless otherwise
indicated by the original languages.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Scripture must be taken in the sense indicated by the
sentence or verse in which it is found. This is the immediate context. The
Scripture must be understood in light of the preceding and following context.
This is the principle of Surrounding Context.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Scripture must be understood in light of the Object
and Purpose of the writer of the book in which your passage lies. The
Scriptures must be understood in conjunction with Parallel Passages which
expand, or clarify your passage.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Scripture must be interpreted on the basis of the
Literal Method of Interpretation, which includes both the actual and the
Figurative meaning of the text. There are many Figures of Speech which usually
involve some Addition, Omission or Change of meaning.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some of the figures of speech that one should be familiar
with, used often in the text are:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Metaphor: one
thing is characterized by what is true of the other.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Synecdoche: the
whole is given for the part, or the part for the whole.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Metonymy: the
sign or symbol for the reality, or cause for the effect</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Personification:
inanimate things given characteristics of persons</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Irony:
expressing the opposite of what you really mean, but making the real meaning
clear.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Hyperbole:
expressing something as larger or smaller than it really is to make it more
vivid.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Allegory:
series of metaphors united in one story, each giving a parallel reality.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Fable: deed or
incident stated in narrative form by means of personification.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Riddle:
expressing something purposely obscure to test the sharpness of those who
attempt to solve it.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Type: kind of
metaphor where deeds, actions, people are regularly associated with certain
corresponding realities.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Symbol: sort of
type where one thing or deed is represented by some other thing which is
well-known and appropriate as a likeness.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Parable: kind
of allegory but one where the issue is the main point taught, not the series of
metaphors with corresponding realities. Centers on real potential happenings,
to illustrate truths.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Hebraisms:
(more sentences structure idioms, rather than figures) These are peculiar
expressions characteristic of the Hebrews and translated into English.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Near Hebraisms:
Certain expressions which relate to Numbers, Actions, and Names.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Rhetorical
Questions: a question that is designed to get an effect, not an answer.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Antithesis:
a sentence structure figure of setting one part of the sentence against another
part of the sentence.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Climax: a
figure of a series of related ideas, each becoming more intensive than the
preceding ones.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Proverb:
the proverb is a common saying or adage which is either set forth as a Point of
Doctrine or used to make a Point of Doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Paradox: a
statement or proposition seemingly self-contradictory or abstruse, and yet
explicable as expressing a truth...an opinion or statement contrary to received
opinion.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Four
Fundamental Laws of Logic:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing ><i>Law of
Identity or Affirmation.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Law of
Contradiction or Negation. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing ><i>Law of
Excluded Middle or Exclusion. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Law of
Sufficient Reason.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Hermeneutics includes the many and varied factors of
Greek and Hebrew Exegesis as to Grammar, Syntax, and Isagogics. Hermeneutics
includes the recognition of Dispensational relationships to a passage.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Hermeneutics requires the utilization of Principles of
Doctrine, Logic, Dispensations, Greek or Hebrew Grammar, Etymology, Textual
Criticism, Isagogics, and plenty of diligence on the part of the one attempting
to extract the meaning of the text. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Total utilization of the Hermeneutical process is
incomplete without the proper exercise of the spiritual gift function, the
Grace Apparatus For Perception, and the maturity level of growth. All these
factors unite to derive and communicate the complete and connect thought of God
concerning the message of the text of the Scriptures.</p>

<h3>Development of the Isagogical Process of Study</h3>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This section will not give and emphasize the content of
the isagogics of Galatians but rather set forth the areas vital to securing isagogical
information for Galatians. Any book can be approached from this standpoint. One
should know the following:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Isagogics of the Major Issue of the book:

background by direct confrontation or by infiltration.</p>

<h3><a name="_Development_of_the_1"></a>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>Development of the Chronological Content of a Book - Galatians</h3>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This section will be demonstrated under 28 chronological
points for the Book of Galatians. The procedure is best explained by an
observation of it in the process. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul begins with the credentials of his apostleship in
the greeting. Paul continues in the greeting with the common relationship of he
and the Galatian believers. Paul hits them directly with their departure from
sound doctrine and into legalism. Paul turns then to his personal motivations
in the ministry.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul discusses the credibility of his message as having
been received directly from God, and not from man. Paul discusses his
background, to clearly establish that he understands well the position of
Jewish legalism. In other words, he says you don’t have to tell me about
yourself, I already know, I was on that team at one time.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He discusses his physical and spiritual birth and the
impartation of his spiritual gift at the point of salvation. He moves on in the
discourse to the matter of preparation and discusses that he did not seek
ecclesiastical verification, but launched immediately upon his actual
preparation and development of the spiritual gift.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He discusses the apostolic fellowship he had at the
outset of his ministry and the limitations of it. He discusses the response of
the churches to his new ministry, how that they didn’t know him as a
personality except that the one who was the enemy now has become the friend.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Chapter 2, he discusses with the Galatians the details
of a trip he made to Jerusalem to a council of Christian leaders, some
knowledgeable and some not. He discusses that while at this Jerusalem council,
false brethren came in to check him out. To cover up that they were false
brethren, they didn’t insist that Titus be circumcised. Why? Because if they
had begun to insist on this, it would have given them away. It would have
exposed them as false brethren and intruders. Paul knew them as this anyway.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul discusses his relation to the false brethren which
came in. He didn’t give them a chance. Not for an hour. He wouldn’t even listen
to their case. They had no dialogue with him. He stayed with his defense of the
Gospel, and that it was also for the Gentiles. Paul discusses the character of
the false brethren as that of having no contribution to make to the council and
their reputation just didn’t impress him at all. He was just unimpressed with
the whole situation of the false brethren.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He moves to the fact of his apostolic endorsement being
recognized and made by the leaders of the Jerusalem church and the council,
James, Peter, and John. These three recognized that Paul was the Apostle to the
Gentiles. The significance of this is that the false brethren and the Judaizers
would have to respect the confirmation of the Jerusalem council leaders.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>From this trip to the Jerusalem council and his
experiences there, Paul moves to a discussion of a trip that Peter made to
Antioch. When Peter was there at Antioch he was conducting himself in a
non-legalistic manner, eating and fellowshipping with the Antioch believers,
(Gentiles in the main.) But during that time, certain news came from James,
that is the Jerusalem church, and when they got there, Peter changed his tune
and catered to their legalistic whims. For this Paul braces him publicly.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This action of Peter influenced Barnabas and he got
carried away with the matter of legalistic separation also. Paul then
challenges Peter in their presence for the practice of religious legalism. Paul
relates this to the Galatian people. In Paul’s challenge of Peter, Paul
establishes that the Jewish believers know that you can’t be justified by faith
and the Law at the same time. If you can be justified and at the same time that
justification is insufficient, then what is that justification? It is nothing at
all, just a phony.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul establishes the Law and grace as mutually exclusive:
Principle of Logic from Hermeneutics. Gal. 2:21. Paul moves from his correction
of Peter to a correction of the Galatians.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He follows the content of:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Beginning and
Finishing: Gal. 3:1-5</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Identification:
Gal. 3:6-9</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Guilt: Gal.
3:10-12</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>The Solution:
Gal. 3:13-16</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Original
Purpose: Gal. 3:17-25</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Positional
Truth: Gal. 3:26-29</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Heirship: Gal.
4:1-7</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul moves in Galatians 4:8 and following with the
results of their Judaism expressed in legalism:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>They are turned
again back to bondage. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>They are turned
to the observance of overt things.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>This is causing
Paul to question his own fruit. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>They as a group
of believers have lost blessings on a personal basis.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul moves from the practice brought on by legalism to an
Old Testament illustration of bondage and freedom. This surely, they will
understand.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Following the illustration of bondage and freedom, Paul
moves to the Doctrine of Christian Liberty as the expression of freedom in the
life of a believer. Gal. 5:1-15.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The declaration of the Doctrine of Liberty sets up the
necessity to explain the proper and improper expression of liberty, the fruits
of the Spirit and the lusts of the flesh. Gal. 5:16-26.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The exercise of liberty and its potential misuses produce
another area of concern, that of the delicate relationship between believers
because of the varying degrees of growth and understanding. Gal. 6:1-5.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>After describing the responsibilities of believers to
each other, Paul cautions on promiscuous sowing to the old sin nature. This he
does in the Doctrine of Sowing. Gal. 6:7-10. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul then personalizes the content of this epistle as
having come directly from his own hand, but makes it clear that what he is, is
only because of who Jesus Christ is. He closes the epistle with the
Celebrityship of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Doctrine of the Grace of God in Galatians</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God used a human author, a rascal, Paul, to write
Galatians, and that was pure Grace.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God gave Paul a gift of Apostleship, and that was grace. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God provided salvation complete in Christ, and that was
grace.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Galatians were still alive even after turning from
grace, and that is pure grace.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God initiated the plan of salvation for you in
Evangelism, that was grace.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God didn't require man to originate the content of his
message, and that is grace.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God provided man a system of perception for receiving biblical
content, and that is grace.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God used man in spite of his background, and that most
definitely is grace.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Production is a grace operation, therefore, it doesn't
depend on reputation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God provides a framework of Christian liberty and
respects the volitional choice of man, and that is grace.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The enemy of grace is legalism.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Grace is not the monopoly of any certain group of people;
it is for Jew, Greek, bond, or free, male or female.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The spiritual gift function of Paul is said to be in
Galatians 2, &quot;grace given to me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When a grace believer (Peter) attempts to practice legalism,
his phoniness comes out all over.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Grace can only be received by a non-meritorious system,
and that being faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Grace includes all the provision of the promises to
Abraham and Isaac.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Grace is shown to be mutually exclusive from works. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Grace has always been God's procedure in handling His
plan, the Law did not take its place.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God provided the indwelling Spirit as a grace enablement
to accomplish what man could not in the flesh accomplish. This is a grace
provision for living the spiritual life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God provided a permanent, final, fixed position for all
His children, and that is grace.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has provided an inheritance for His family, and that
is grace.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Turning from grace produces adverse effects in the life
of a believer.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Departure from the grace principle of living the
spiritual life living causes communicators anxiety for their sheep.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A communicator who is grace oriented does not take a
doctrinal problem as an attack on him personally.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A person is fallen from grace when he has replaced the
grace system with some other system for salvation, spirituality, maturity, or
production.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Grace and faith are set in analogy as warring against legalism,
and vice versa.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Grace is never to be distorted as a license to sin. True
liberty should not be used as a base of operations for the old sin nature.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The true grace expression in living the spiritual life is
the filling of the Holy Spirit and the fruits thereof.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The opposite of grace is human good or sin production
when the soul s controlled by the Old Sin Nature (carnality).</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Grace in the spiritual life is a necessity because of our
many relationships with people We must be grace oriented and relate also to
others who are.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A grace relationship and understanding does not absolve
us of personal responsibilities to the weaker brethren, those under loads, etc.
It is so easy to quote the phrase: “Oh, God's grace is or will sustain you,”
then go our merry way and forget them.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An understanding of grace, that all we are or have, is
due to grace, should curtail efforts on our part to seek personal glory.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Doctrine
of the Law in the Book of Galatians</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>See category of <a
href="#_The_Mosaic_Law_1">The Mosaic Law, The Mosaic Law in the Book of
Galatians</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Doctrine of the Legalism in the Book of Galatians</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Legalism is a result of a process of turning away from
the Truth. Gal. 1:6</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Legalism therefore is volitionally “entered into” Present
Middle Indicative in Gal. 1:6</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The brand of legalism entered into usually will be
directly related to some type of background exposure, practice, or principle.
Galatians deals with religious legalism which was the basic feature of the religion
of Judaism. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Legalism always has a pseudo content: “another Gospel.”
This is set forth in the sphere of good news. Gal. 1:7</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Legalism once operative in the life causes a person or
persons to become very suspicious of the motives, methods, message, and person
of someone else. Gal. 1:10-11</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Legalism can be spotted very easily by a communicator who
has himself been in that type of set up. Paul formerly at the top of the
Judaism syndrome could smell legalism a mile off.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Legalism usually operates under the cloak of
respectability and seeks to keep hidden its real processes of operation. This
is the spying principle of Gal. 2.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Legalism usually follows the technique of infiltration to
gather information, and will bide the time necessary until it best suits their
purposes. Gal. 2.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When legalism is met with positive doctrinal content and
procedure, it crumbles and is unable to fulfill its objectives. Paul refused
them opportunity to get their campaign launched. Gal. 2.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When legalism loses its battle on one front, it will
simply move to another base of operation and attempt the same thing.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Legalism sometimes cannot get a grasp on a person when in
the strength of the company of other strong believers, so it will concentrate
on an Individual w when that one is standing alone.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Legalism is often seen in leadership before in the
congregation. This is fundamentalism today.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When a leader gets involved in legalism, he influences
others to go the same way with him.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When a person gets involved with legalism as a principle
of life, it distorts his whole approach to doctrine. It affects the salvation
principle, also that of growth, spirituality, and maturity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The content of legalism is often something else that in
itself had a bonafide function. Legalism in Galatians was a distortion of the
Law. The Law did have a real and bonafide function. Legalism takes a bonafide
thing and distorts it. It takes the doctrine of separation and makes that the
doctrine of spirituality. It takes baptism and makes that the doctrine of
church membership.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The person in legalism has been “bewitched.” This term in
the Greek means “to have evil brought on you by vain praise.” This is where the
legalist appeals to the approbation lust of another and through this means
sucks him into the legalism pipe.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The person in legalism is described as “foolish.” Foolish
means “not understanding.” Legalism is seen to be one of the greatest robbers
of Christian benefits by simply robbing the person from understanding the text,
and all its benefits.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The legalist does not learn by experience. They have a
peculiar tenacity and despite many failures, and vain strivings, they still
can't see their error. Galatians 3:4 has the concept--haven't you finally seen
that your programs don't work, you have to go from one thing to the next,
always looking for something better, never completely satisfied, nor satisfying
others.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The very thing that the legalist puts himself under, is
that which rises up and smites him. A believer puts himself under the taboos of
others, he can't measure up; so he puts himself under his own taboos, he still
can't measure up; he puts himself under some church organization, he still
can't measure up. The very system that he embraces is that which proves him to
be deficient. Grace is the only system which does not maximize the believers
deficiencies. 2 Cor. 3:4-5.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer in legalism has to be dealt with by an
authoritative spiritual gift of a communication nature (Paul an apostle), and
with content, that is known to the believer in legalism. New content that a
believer has not learned cannot be used to convict the person or straighten him
out. The believer out of fellowship is in no position to respond to new Truth
given to correct him.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Legalism in the Church Age is in parallel to many other
things of previous ages. It is seen in the Isaac and Ishmael issue, the Sarah
and Hagar issue, in the traditions concept attached to the Law; while in the
Church Age we see legalism in Galatians in salvation and circumcision,
salvation and the Law, salvation and taboos, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Legalism is set forth in the book of Galatians as a
bondage by legitimate things, taken from their proper contexts. The term
bondage means the “principles and ways of regular human living.” This is not
the degraded debauchery concept. The Law was a bonafide tool in God's plan, circumcision
was bonafide in God's plan. Legalism distorts bonafide things and turns them
into the master of the person instead of simply a tool.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In dealing with the content of legalism, the communicator
has to deal with the specific thing which comprises the legalism. Possibly it
might be the legalism of language, then the communicator has to clarify
language, or legalism of ritual, or legalism of policy. In all regards, the
communicator must clarify that thing to remove it as a source of trouble. Paul
clarified specific issues of: law, grace, liberty, circumcision, works, taboos,
etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Legalism has a pattern of expression: In Galatians,
legalism follows this pattern:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Galatians
came under the influence of Judaistic legalism. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Then they took
themselves out from under the grace principle, volitionally, and put themselves
under the Law. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacingThis soon
adopted an overt pattern of observing the days, months, times, and years. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This then
influenced their appreciation of their communicator and turned Paul into an
enemy. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It had stopped
their growth process and Christ had not become formed in them. This is the
growth concept to maturity. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As a result of
stymied growth and the absence of maturity, production had been curtailed in a
bonafide way, by the filling of the Spirit, and had resulted in pseudo
production expressed as the lusts of the flesh. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Along with pseudo production of the legalist goes many
other accompanying factors:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1. The glory seeking concept of
Galatians 5:26. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>2. The concept of straightening
everyone else out. Gal. 6:1 </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>3. Getting your eyes on people,
or ignore them. Gal. 6:2-6 </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>4. The concept of “weariness”
with actual doctrinal production. The legalist cannot stay with sound doctrine.
It is weariness to him, and most peel off. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>5. The concept of “showing off”
or trying to impress your peers or your superiors, or those under you. Gal.
6:11-13. This is programism to the maximum. Many today are not interested in
the lives of the people to whom they minister, the people are just numbers in
the ecclesiastical game of numbers and stats. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>6. Man gets the glory, God is
left out, and this is the antithesis of grace. Gal. 6:14-15.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul in Galatians 6:16 makes it very clear that those who
continue in legalism do not have his blessing or that of God. Peace and mercy
is ascribed to those who follow the rule of grace and faith that he has set
forth in Galatians. Likewise, wrath is set upon those in legalism and who
continue therein.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Doctrine of Preparation in the Book of Galatians</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul’s preparation for the ministry began in eternity
past with the plan of God, but on earth at the point of salvation. Paul’s
preparation for the ministry included him being equipped with a spiritual gift
for function. Paul’s preparation then centered on content given directly from
God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul’s background was an aid to prepare him for future
problems in the ministry. Human acquirements in training and service were not
issues in his preparation. Paul’s preparation did not take him to consult with
many other men.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In preparation, Paul did not look to approved
ecclesiastical authorities for vindication and authentication. Paul’s
preparation covered at least 3 years, most of which he was isolated and had
very little ministry. Paul’s preparation had enabled him to understand all the
major doctrines of the Word. Following Paul’s preparation, Paul ministered for
some time before having his spiritual gift confirmed by his peers.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Doctrine of Responsibility in the Book of
Galatians</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Galatians are held responsible for their departure
from grace. Gal. 1.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Peter was held responsible for his departure from the
grace practice.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Believer is responsible to obey the moral law, but no
longer responsible to the Mosaic Law in its intended function.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer is responsible for growth to maturity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is not the responsibility of the Law to bring salvation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Responsibility is seen consistently in the authority
chain of command: (father, tutor, governor, child)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The communicator, Apostle Paul, assumes responsibility
for the Galatians as his sheep.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The doctrine of the liberty of the believer does not
eliminate or neutralize the responsibility of the believer. Liberty is not irresponsibility.
Gal. 5:13</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Responsibility is enjoined upon the believer to volitionally
respond to the Word in content, rather than the old sin nature in content,
resulting in the fruit of the Spirit rather than the lusts of the flesh.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers in fellowship and preferably in maturity are
responsible to communicate divine viewpoint to believers out of fellowship or
in reversion that can correct their situation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers are enjoined to share the burdens and trials of
others. This is not an option, it is a responsibility. Too often this is one of
the reasons that believers do not want to get close to a work, or a pastor, or
a family. To get close, one begins to feel the pressure, the obligations, the
vision, and with these come the responsibility to assist that that knowledge
and relationship brings to you.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All believers have the responsibility to keep their own
lives straight before the Lord as their number one priority. This includes a
correct evaluation of yourself, and a proving of your own production.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All believers have the responsibility to contribute
finances for the care and sustainment of those who minister to them.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Responsibility for divine good production is directly
proportionate to the opportunity and maturity of the believer. As God promotes,
gives opportunity, the believer assumes then the privilege of the task, and the
responsibility that goes with it.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer in his production is not responsible for the
increase. He is only responsible to carry out the task. Only God gives the
increase. The believer must be faithful to obey the command and trust God for
the results.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer in carrying out his responsibilities in
growth, maturity, and production will have much Undeserved Suffering that will
be visible to all.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Doctrine of Salvation in the Book of Galatians</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Savior of the world is set forth in Galatians 1:4.
Every salvation plan has to have a person as the Savior, whether it is the
general salvation of a nation in human terms or spiritual salvation in God's plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The principle of sanctification as a part of the plan of
salvation is set forth in Galatians 1:15.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The principle of calling as a part of the plan of
salvation is set forth in Galatians 1:15.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The revelation of the contents of the plan is indicated
in Galatians 1:11-12</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Salvation provides fellowship: Gal.1:10-13.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Salvation is universal as to its recipients (those to
whom it is offered). Gal. 2.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Salvation is by faith (the justification by faith
concept). Gal. 2. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Salvation includes the indwelling of Christ in believers.
Gal. 2. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Salvation includes the maturity process as the direction
in this life on earth. Gal. 3:2-3. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Salvation has always been by faith. Gal. 3:6.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Salvation does not come by the Law. Gal. 3 and 4.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Redemption as a part of salvation was accomplished by
Christ. Gal. 3:13.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Salvation is connected with God's promise to Abraham.
Gal. 3:13.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Salvation is connected with the Seed of Abraham. Gal.
3:16. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Salvation is connected with the promise of the Spirit.
Gal. 3:18. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Salvation is connected with the Angelic Conflict. Gal.
3:20-21.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Salvation is needed by all regardless of ethnic
background. Gal. 3:22.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Salvation in position is initiated by Spirit baptism.
Gal. 3:27.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Salvation puts all believers into the Body of Christ
permanently.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Salvation has a family concept in this life and in
eternity. We are sons.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Salvation is connected with the doctrine of adoption in
positional experiential and ultimate fashion.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Salvation has a heirship concept. We are heirs now, but
will realize the proceeds in eternity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Salvation is not destroyed by carnality, reversion, but
its growth concepts, spirituality and maturity is definitely affected.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Salvation is designed as a maximum liberty and benefit
plan, not a bondage slaving system.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Salvation has three phases, 1) Regeneration or the new
birth, 2) Filling of the Spirit and production of the fruit of the Spirit, and
3) Maximum glorification to God. (This phase doesn't come to the surface much
in Galatians except in the heirship concept.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Salvation is very practical as it must be related in life
to those about us.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A part of the whole salvation doctrine in Galatians is
production and patience is enjoined upon the believer in sowing.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Salvation through the death of Christ on the Cross is not
designed to bring glory to us but rather to Jesus Christ and the Father.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Doctrine of Spiritual Gifts in the Book of
Galatians</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first place we face the concept of spiritual gifts is
in the term “apostle.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Therefore, the major functions of spiritual gifts in
Galatians would center on the features especially of the gift of Apostleship.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual gift of apostle would include the concept of
Revelation of the content of doctrine. This is not true of any existing gift
today.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual gift of apostle would include the concept of inspiration
in the writing down of the content of Scripture, given by revelation or
otherwise. This also is nonexistent today.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual gift of apostle would include the concept of
authority over more than one church as the Epistle is written to the “churches
of Galatia.” This too is nonexistent today in a bona fide way.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual gift of apostle would include the function of “trouble-shooting”
in Galatians as Paul is dealing with the isolating and solving of a particular
problem in the churches of Galatia.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual gift of apostle would include the function of “shepherding”
as he applies and teaches doctrine on spirituality, growth, maturity, and
production.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual gift of apostle would include the function of “evangelizing”
and is indicated in Galatians by reference to this type of preaching in
Galatians 1.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual gift of apostle included for Paul a “specific
niche” in which and to whom the major part of his ministry would relate. He was
an apostle to the Gentiles and Peter was the apostle to the Jews.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Galatians verifies the principle that there is an
interdependent ministry of one spiritual gift to another spiritual gift on the
same level. Paul had a ministry to Peter, although they were both apostles.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Galatians and Paul make it clear that spiritual gift
production is not dependent on human good excellence or reputation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul makes it clear that production is possible without
human verification of your spiritual gift.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Galatians makes it clear that Paul felt it important to
clarify his spiritual gift function and ministry to those of his peers,
especially at Jerusalem.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Galatians makes it clear that Peter, James, and john
recognized clearly the spiritual gift function of Paul. This is the concept of
others recognizing your spiritual gift.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Galatians makes it clear that the possession of a
spiritual gift even on the level of an apostle does not keep one from falling.
Paul remained true in Galatians, but Peter crumbled. Both had the spiritual
gift of apostle.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul did not make the spiritual gift an issue with the
Galatian people such as he did with the Corinthians. Believers who are stacked
up in legalism need first that which will free them to growth procedures before
they ever think of production.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Although Paul was an apostle by spiritual gift, he
continually held forth the common bond of relationship he had with the people.
He stated that he was as they are.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul's spiritual gift of apostle was many things but
largely communicator in Galatians. The exercise of his spiritual gift did not
guarantee that people would utilize all his content or follow his authority.
This is made clear by the fact of their departure from the grace principle.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual gift production is always and naturally desired
to be preserved and all who communicate jealously guard their fruit and message
content. They respond decisively when anyone tampers with it.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The possession of a spiritual gift does not remove human
frailties or problems. This is made clear by the reference to Paul's
infirmities.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The proper exercise of the spiritual gift finds Jesus
Christ as the One being glorified and not the spiritual gift or the one
possessing it.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Doctrine of Production from the Book of Galatians</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Production is first seen in the Book of Galatians with
the Apostle Paul evangelizing. The fruit of production in evangelizing is the
salvation of souls. This is viewed by many today as the greatest part of the
production of the believer. However, this is a false concept.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Production follows adequate preparation. Galatians 1 depicts
Paul as thoroughly prepared before he began his evangelizing ministry besides
the further ministry of teaching and edifying.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The production of a believer is the source of blessing to
other believers who may only hear about it. Gal. 1:24.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The production of a believer is directly related to his
spiritual gift and being in the right niche. Galatians 2: This is based on the
concept of Paul vindicating the spiritual gift that he had with his production
and that, with the certain people, the Gentiles.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Production will vary at different levels of spiritual
gift development. In Galatians 1 we find Paul evangelizing, in Galatians 2 we
find him trouble-shooting a problem, in Galatians 3 we find him doing much
teaching and explaining. The Book of Galatians itself is the production of
writing the text of Scripture itself.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Production is not dependent upon reputation. Galatians 2.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The production of the believer is not a result of some
human good system of works or programs. It is by the principle of grace and
faith. Gal. 3:5.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In production, the believer often has to curtail his
liberty so that it will not rise up and overthrow the very thing that he is
trying to accomplish. This is operation of the law of supreme sacrifice. Gal. 5.
“Use not your liberty as an occasion to the flesh.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One of the hazards of the believer in production is the
temptation to keep operating out of fellowship rather than getting back into
fellowship or stopping until he does. This is particularly true today because
of the countless number of men in the ministry who do not understand and
believe the principle of 1 John 1:9 and confessing sin biblically.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Book of Galatians, two types of production stand
out. First, the production of the old sin nature called the works of the flesh.
Secondly, the production of the Spirit called the fruit of the Spirit. Gal.
5:17-23.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The production of the fruit of the Spirit is the result
of the filling of the Spirit. The production of the believer in fellowship is a
result of the spiritual gift capacity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul does not make the production of the Galatian
believers in their spiritual gift capacity an issue because their problem
centered with the production of the Spirit. Legalism is the enemy of the
filling of the Spirit. It is foolish to talk about production of the spiritual
gift unless there is production of the fruit of the Spirit. A believer cannot
have spiritual gift production without filling of the Spirit production.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>However, a believer can have filling of the Spirit
production without having spiritual gift production. Spiritual gift production
depends not only on the filling of the Spirit but also upon doctrinal content,
growth and maturity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are general factors of production common to all
believers, and then specific functions that relate to believers with certain
spiritual gifts. In Galatians 6:2, we have some of the general functions of
production common to all believers. However, there are certain production
factors that relate to specific communication and leadership gifts. Gal. 6:2-10.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The man in his proper spiritual gift production is worthy
of support from those who prosper from his ministry. Gal. 6:6. The meaning of
the Greek term, “communicate” has to do with the matter of responsible sharing
of financial needs.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Continued production requires patience and endurance and
there will be the harvest. Gal. 6:9.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Production is always a natural function of a supernatural
capacity and ability. Production is never, or should never be, a forced
function.</p>

<h3><a name="_Translation_Factor"></a>Translation Factor</h3>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To be able to get the complete and connected thought in
the work of exegesis one must:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Be able to recognize the case functions and relationships
of all nouns, pronouns, prepositions and adjectives in a sentence.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He must be able to recognize the basic parts of the
sentence: the subject, the verb, participle, or infinitive, the indirect
object, the preposition, the direct object or various types of clauses,
independent or dependent, comparative or subordinating, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He must be able to recognize the use of particles,
conjunctions, or prepositions which are links to unifying the thoughts either
brought together in one sentence or unifying former thoughts or former
sentences and embracing also those to follow.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One must be able to understand the significance of the
choice of the writer in the vehicle used to convey the action in the sentence,
whether a verb is used or a participle or an infinitive.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One must recognize the particular characteristics of the
writer being studied as to personality, grammatical vehicles of expression, the
use of idiom, the use of repetition and other distinguishing marks.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One must recognize the context doctrinally from a much
broader scope to be able to determine the specific case, tense, and mood
inflection occurring in the given sentence.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One must recognize the various principles that relate to
the combining of words in a sentence such as prepositions with cases, definite
articles with cases, articles with participles.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One must note very carefully the principles relating to
the conjunction &quot;kai&quot; and its combination with other words.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One must remain constantly alert to those words or forms
that have alternate meanings. The article can be used in a possessive pronoun
status, for example. Note all those things that have variant usages.</p>
