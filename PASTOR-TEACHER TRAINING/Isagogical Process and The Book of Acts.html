<h2>Isagogical Process and The Book of Acts</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Isagogics is one of the factors vital to an understanding
and preparation of biblical material for ICE teaching. Isagogics is defined in
Webster’s Dictionary as: “Introductory study, especially theological, that part
of theology directly preliminary to actual exegesis and concerned with the
literary history of the Bible.” Therefore, in this study we set forth those
areas which will be most helpful to the fulfillment of this type of preliminary
study.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Within this study are the necessary procedures for
Isagogical research besides the identification of those areas most vital to the
preliminary study of the Bible. The following are among those covered in this
section: geographical, literary, ecclesiastical, governmental, textual (acts),
and musical.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Further demonstration of the Isagogical process is
clarified in the section on the <a href="#_The_Academic_Study">Academic Study
Process</a>. Referral to that section will prove helpful to keep in focus the
matter of Isagogics as it relates to the overall study of the Academic Study
Process.</p>
<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Problems to be faced in the Isagogical Process in
Study</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first problem is knowing your needs. A student often
feels that he knows best what he needs in the area of isagogics. This is a
falsehood. The student does not know what he needs unless he is taught. The isagogics
class is not just the giving of isagogical data, though this will be included.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The second problem is the student who cannot properly
evaluate his sources. What are the criteria upon which you base the validity of
your source? What are the criteria upon which you base your ability to
determine your source?</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The third problem is interpretation of the significance
of the content of your sources. What is the significance of a writer stating a
point in agreement with your belief, if he differs with you on all other
points? What is the interpretation of the meaning of a point made, as used by
the writer who either made or quoted it? The problem of knowing the sources
which form the basis of sound categorical isagogics.</p>
<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Procedure in the Pursuit of Isagogics</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There must be emphasis on the process of doing isagogics.
Isagogics is one step in the academic process of seven. Attention will be given
to the proper execution of the isagogical process. In handling the isagogical
process it will be imperative to deal with the following things; 1) Building a
notebook of sound isagogical sources for specific biblical truths, and 2) Learning
how to coordinate source information and arrive at sound conclusions.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It will not be the purpose to just give you factual data
to consider or solve certain problems, but to effectively demonstrate all the
factors that are vital to equip you to handle all the isagogical needs of a
passage and conserve results.</p>
<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Isagogics and the Book of Acts</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>First we will categorize isagogical information by
source.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Word Pictures in the New Testament: Vol. III, A.T.
Robertson (introduction) </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The author: Luke, is a companion of Paul. The unity of
the book: based on the “we” sections. Sources of the book: Quotes Cadbury who
suggests Acts as Vol. II. Personal experiences as a source, Paul’s notes, in
conclusion many sources.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The date: written by Luke while with Paul in Rome by 63
AD. Historical value: All evidence confirms the testimony of Luke historically.
Luke is held over Josephus when they differ. Ramsey calls Luke the greatest of
all historians, quoted by A.T. Robertson. Purpose: Did not give a clear
singular purpose of Acts. Suggested many that others had suggested.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Lecture Notes on Acts: Dr. Martin Massinger, Dallas
Bible College </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Title: “Acts.” Date: about 65 AD. Author: Luke, Luke
1:1-4. Place in the Bible: cited from Scofield. “Preparation:” The Old
Testament. “Manifestation: The Gospels. “Propagation:” The Acts. “Explanation:”
The Epistles. “Consummation:” The Revelation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Place in history: 30-60 AD Pre-Canon history of the
church. Characteristics of the book: Prominence of the Holy Spirit, reaching,
prayer, resurrection, missionary zeal, purity and vigor in the church, mass
conversions, persecutions. Outline of the book: formed the basis of the content
in teaching the book of Acts.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Isagogical Information from Acts Lessons of R.B.
Thieme, Jr. </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Nature of the book of Acts: History of the church before
the completion of the Canon. Place of Acts in the New Testament: Pre-canon
history, not much of Gospels and little of the Epistles are known to the writer
of Acts. Style in the Greek of Acts: same as in Luke. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Author: Luke without any question. Date: Between 61-63
AD. Place: Luke was writing Acts when Paul was writing the four prison
epistles, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Philemon. This was at the first
imprisonment and while he was with Paul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: “Acts” A.T.
Robertson </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The title: Deals with the title from the standpoint of
the Greek manuscripts and church fathers and later textual critics. Four
suggested titles were given as occurring in different manuscripts. No
conclusion was secured. The test type: Scholars cannot agree on the original
text type of Acts. This section would have to be studied very carefully and
analyzed. Some dozen scholars are compared. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The unity of the book: Based on the “we” sections, one
author, Luke, a clear aim in the book to give the history of the church. The
author: He was a companion of Paul, has many distinct points of the language of
a physician, is written from the vivid description of an eyewitness, was
accepted by the Muratorian Canon and the Gospel was also included as authored
by Luke. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The canonicity: In Irenaeus, often the Acts are indicated
as Scripture. It was accepted in the Muratorian Canon in the second century,
accepted by Tertullian and Clement of Alexandria also. The date: Modern critics
place it between 70-80 AD based on Luke 21:20, Mark 13:14, Matt. 24:15. Many
scholars date it before 70 AD. The conclusion by the writer in I.S.B.E. is 63
AD, written in Rome. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The sources used by the writer: He used oral and written
sources. Much discussion but the general conclusion is based on Luke 1:1-4. The
speeches in Acts: Some by Paul, some by Peter, compared and contrasted and
related to the author in his writing from the standpoint of direct or indirect
source material. Acts related to other epistles: Deals extensively with the
Gal. 1 and 2 coordination with Acts. The harmonization of the book of Acts with
the data in the Epistles becomes easy when it is remembered that they
supplement each other.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Chronology: The basic problem in Acts as to chronology is
the absence of specifics which seemingly a historian would record. The use of
terms like “not many days hence” or “in these days,” exemplifies this. The
section deals with defining the certain dates and working in the others
involving historical persons or events. The historical worth of Acts: Many
striking instances of specific terms related exactly as they should be as to
location, usage, peoples, etc. It is classed as a real history which by definition
by critics is an interpretation of the events of history. Ramsey ranks Luke as
a historian of the first order. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The purpose of the book: I.S.B.E. gives many theories as
to the purpose of the book. Conclusions: The book is designed for the
enlightenment of Christians generally concerning the historic origins of
Christianity. It is in reality, the Acts of the Holy Spirit as wrought through
these men. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The analysis of the book: Connection of work of apostle
and of Jesus. Development of the work in Jerusalem. Extension of the Gospel to
Judea, Samaria, and neighboring regions. Conversion of Saul changes situation
for Christianity. Door opened to the Gentiles: Romans and Greeks. Persecution
from the civil government. Gentile propaganda from Antioch under the leadership
of Barnabas and Paul. Gentile campaign challenged by the Judaizers. Second
great campaign extending to Europe. Third great tour, with Ephesus as
headquarters. Paul turns to Jerusalem again with plans for Rome. The outcome of
Jerusalem. Paul a prisoner in Caesarea. Paul goes to Rome. Paul in Rome. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Recommendations for research by the author: A.T.
Robertson (categorized). Introduction to Acts: He recommend 13 other sources,
the authors of which are: Bacon, Bennett &amp; Adeney, S. Davidson, C.R.
Gregory, H.J. Holtzmann, Jacquies, Julicher, Peake, Reuss, Salmon, Von Soden,
B. Weiss, Westcott, Zahn, Moffatt.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Test of Acts: He recommends 9 sources, the authors of
which are: J. Rendel Harris, Nestle, Klostermann, Sorssen, Chase, Bornemann,
Blass, Weiss, von Sodden, Westcott, Tischendorf, Scrivener, Gregory, Kenyon. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Apostolic History of Acts: Robertson suggests 31 sources
with authors too numerous to list. Most of these relate to the life of Paul. 
Special Treatises on Acts: Robertson suggests 27 sources with many authors. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Commentaries on the Book of Acts: Robertson recommends as
great standard works those by: Bede, Bengel, Calvin, Chrysostom, Grotius.
Modern commentaries he notes are 22 in number, the latest in 1901 by Rockham. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This adds up to a total of sources used or recommended by
A.T. Robertson in authoring the article on Acts in the International Standard
Bible Encyclopedia to that of 102, (probably more books than you have in your
library).</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>New Testament Survey: by Merrill C. Tenney, Dean of
Graduate School, Wheaton, College, Wheaton, III</u></p>

information: The establishment of the church. The transition of the church. The
Gentile church and the Pauline mission. The Pauline program. The Pauline

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Unger’s Bible Dictionary:</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The name: “Acts of the Holy Spirit” is a more accurate

passages. The place: Relates the place to Paul’s imprisonment, the purpose for
writing, and the publication occasion of the book. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The date: 61-62 AD. Later date surely would have included
the Jewish war of 66-70 AD. It is omitted in Acts. If Josephus was looked to as
source material it would have to be dated at 93 AD.  Speeches in Acts: Appear

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Isagogical Data for the Book of Acts, Sources Coordinated</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Author </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The author of the Book of Acts was Luke, as a companion
of Paul. Luke, with the language of a physician, wrote with vivid description
of an eyewitness and was accepted by the Muratorian Canon as the author of
Acts. Luke was also the author of the Gospel of Luke which was directed it to
Theophilus, emphasized the “we” sections. Luke 1:1-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Inasmuch as many have undertaken to compile an account of the
things accomplished among us, just as they were handed down to us by those who
from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word, it seemed
fitting for me as well, having investigated everything carefully from the
beginning, to write it out for you in consecutive order, most excellent
Theophilus; so that you may know the exact truth about the things you have been
taught.” (Luke 1:1-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Date</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Book of Acts was written by Luke between 61-63 AD with
the book terminating with Paul’s two year imprisonment in Rome. However, modern
critics place the writing of Acts at between 70-80 AD based on Luke 21:21, Mark
13:14, and Matthew 24:15. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains,
and those who are in the midst of the city must leave, and those who are in the
country must not enter the city;” (Luke 21:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But when you see the ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION standing
where it should not be (let the reader understand), then those who are in Judea
must flee to the mountains.” (Mark 13:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Therefore when you see the ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION
which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let
the reader understand),” (Matthew 24:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Many scholars date the Book of Acts before 70 AD and
conclude it was written in 63 AD in Rome. If it were written at a later date,
the Jewish war of 66-70 AD would not have been omitted. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Nature of the Book of Acts</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>History of the church before the completion of the canon
of Scripture. Pre-canon history of the church, with emphasis on the propagation
of the Gospel. All evidence confirms the testimony of Luke historically, with
Luke being held over Josephus when they differ. Ramsey calls Luke the greatest
of all historians and identifies the book as a historical document. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is classed as a real history which by definition by
critics is an interpretation of the events of history. It is a continuation of
the account of Christianity begun in Luke’s Gospel. It is a book which shows
the progress of Christianity and continues the Acts of the risen Lord through
the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Place of the Writing of Acts</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Written in Rome by Luke while with Paul. Luke was writing
Acts when Paul was writing the four prison epistles, Ephesians, Philippians,
Colossians and Philemon at the first imprisonment. Written in Rome in 63 AD.
Written in relation with Paul’s imprisonment.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Title for the Book of Acts </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The title is “Acts.”  Four suggested titles, no
conclusive one given.  “Acts of the Holy Spirit’’ is a more accurate title and the
most appropriate.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Purpose of the Book of Acts </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>No clear purpose given; many possible reasons for writing
given. The book is designed for the enlightenment of Christians generally
concerning the historic origin of Christianity. It is in reality the Acts of
the Holy Spirit as wrought through these men.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Place of Acts in the Bible </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Old Testament shows the preparation of God’s plan;
the Gospels show the manifestation of God in His plan; the Acts show the
propagation of the Gospel in God’s plan, the Epistles show the explanation of
God’s plan involving the church; and the Revelation shows the consummation of
God’s plan. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Pre-canon history, not much of the Gospels and little of
the Epistles is known to the writer of Acts. Acts deals extensively with the
Galatians 1-2 coordination with Acts. The harmonization of the book of Acts
with the data in the Epistles becomes easy when it is remembered that they
supplement each other.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Characteristics of the Book of Acts </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Holy Spirit is prominent as are preaching, prayer,
resurrection, missionary zeal, purity and vigor in the Church, mass
conversions, and persecutions. Acts was written in the same style of Greek as
the Gospel of Luke.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Canonicity of the Book of Acts </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Irenaeus often indicated the Acts as Scripture. It was
accepted by the Muratorian Canon and the Gospel was also included as authored
by Luke.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Speeches in the Book of Acts</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They appear in the style of the one speaking, with
distinguishing characteristics. The marks of a good historian is one who can
accurately relate a speech conveying the content and style of the one giving
it. The speeches include those given by Peter, Paul, Stephen, and the Ephesian
town clerk.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Chronology of the Book of Acts</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The basic problem in Acts as to chronology is the absence
of specifics which seemingly a historian would record. This is illustrated by
terms such as, “not many days hence” or “in these days.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The basis for determining the chronology of the Apostolic
Age is that of fixed points within the book of Acts. From this basis, other
things not specified can be assimilated. Nearly a dozen of these can be
determined. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are many references in the book of Acts to time
durations they include; </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1) Paul’s arrest in Jerusalem, two years before the
accession of Festus (Acts 24:27), </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>2) Paul spent three months in Corinth (Acts 20:3), </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>3) Paul spent three years in Ephesus (Acts 20:31, Acts 19:10),
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>4) There was a time gap between the second and third
journey (Acts 18:23), and </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>5) Paul spent 18 months in Corinth (Acts 18:110.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Structure for the Book of Acts</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Book of Acts deals with: the establishment, the
transition, the Pauline mission, the Pauline program, and the Pauline
imprisonment (development stages factor). The Book of Acts deals with the
apostles in Jerusalem in Judea and Samaria and Paul as a witness to the
uttermost parts of the earth (geographical factor). The Book of Acts can be
structured around the prominent factors. The Holy Spirit, preaching, prayer,
resurrection, missionary zeal, purity and vigor in the church, mass conversions
and persecutions. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Book of Acts can be structured around the
chronological content factors. This is simply structuring the book around the
analysis of the content as given in the historical account of the writer in a
factual way. A systematic unfolding of detail and general factors in the
narrative indicating a progression of activity. The Book of Acts can be
structured around the coordination of geographical factors with development
factors of the Church: </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Introduction </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Origin of the
church; geographical factor, Jerusalem </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Transition of
the church: geographical factor, Samaria </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Expansion to
the Gentiles: geographical factor, Antioch and the Empire. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The
imprisonment of Paul: geographical factor, Caesarea and Rome.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Source:</u> </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Unger’s Bible Dictionary</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Scripture References to Antioch:</u> </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Acts 11:19-20, Acts 11:21-30.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Background of Antioch of Syria:</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Founded in 300 BC by Seleucus Nicator. Was destroyed
several times by earthquakes; one in 526 AD killed 250,000 people. It was
luxurious, with the main street being four miles long, lined with mansions. It
was highly cultured, but socially it was debased, sensual and shocking.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A large part of the population was Jewish, having been
colonized by Nicator. It was a large city, becoming third in the Roman Empire,
was made the capital of Syria, a section of the Roman Empire, with a population
of 500,000 people.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Geography:</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It was located on the Orontes River 16-1/2 miles from the
Mediterranean Sea and 300 miles north of Jerusalem. It was located between two
mountain ranges, the Lebanon and Taurus mountains.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Its Chronology:</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Founded in 300 BC. Made the capital of Syria in 64 BC.
Persecuted disciples fled here after the stoning of Stephen. The most
flourishing period of the Christian church here in Antioch was in the days of
Chrysostom, born about 347 AD. It was conquered by the Saracens in 635, later
by the Turks in 1084 AD. It has declined under Mohammedan rule since 1268. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Its Significance in the Book of Acts:</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is associated with early Christian effort. Here is
where the disciples fled after the death of Stephen. Acts 11:19-20.  Here the
believers were first called Christians in a term of derision.  From here Paul
made the departure for each of his missionary journeys. More than a score of
early Christian churches have been identified in Antioch.</p>
