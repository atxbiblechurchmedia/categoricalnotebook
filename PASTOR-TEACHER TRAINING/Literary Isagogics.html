<h2>Literary Isagogics</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><a name="_Literature_and_Jewish"></a><b>Literature and
Jewish Theology from the Categorical Standpoint</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Literature and its Influence on Jewish Theology</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Literature according to name or category; 1) The Talmud,
2) The Targum, 3) The Mishnah, 4) The Midrash, 5) The Halakhah, 6) The
Haggadah, 7) The Septuagint, 8) Aquila’s Greek Version, 9) Apocrypha, 10)
Pseudepigraphal Writings, 11) Philo’s Canons, and 12) Torah.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Torah </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This was the name given to the first section of the
Hebrew canon of the Scriptures which were divided into three parts. The Torah
first began as the five books of Moses or the Pentateuch. Later the Pharisees
and Rabbis recognized an Oral Torah, which was made up of applications of
general principles of the written Torah.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Targums </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>These were explanations of the Hebrew, translations and
paraphrases of the Hebrew in Chaldaic for the Jews who no longer understood or
used the Hebrew. The actual word means “to explain” or “to interpret.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Many Jews during the Babylonian captivity had adopted
Southwestern Aramaic as their origin both in the captivity area and in
Palestine. The worship during this time had also shifted from the temple
centered worship to several things: Study of the Law in common. Chanting of
Psalms and united prayers. Therefore, the language used by Ezra and others in
explaining the Law was that which the people understood, Aramaic.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The three basic Targums of the Old Testament: The Targum
on the Pentateuch Targum of Onkelos, about 70 AD. The Targum on the Prophets
Targum of Jonathan ben Uzziel, a student of the school of Hillel, first half of
the first century. The Targum on the Writings, or Hagiographist: This includes
Psalms, Proverbs, Job, Chronicles, Esther.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The language of the Targums was basically Western
Aramaic, colored with Hebrew. The time concept of the Targums they date back to
444 BC orally with the written ones coming on from the first century up to the
tenth century or so. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The communication of the Targums to the people. Nehamiah
8.8 has a three-fold process. They read “distinctly” means the reading of the
Law in the Hebrew.  “Giving the sense” means the translating of the Hebrew into
Aramaic. “Cause to understand the reading” means to interpret in Aramaic the
meaning of the translation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Talmud gives extensive and explicit rules for
interpretation of the Hebrew test. There is a question, of course, on how
closely they followed the rules. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A sample of the rules of interpretation of the Targums
follows: The Law was read by the reader verse by verse and each verse was
followed by the interpretation, (actually, the translation and interpretation)
in Aramaic. In prophetic books, they read three verses before the translation
and explanation. In reading, the one reading the Hebrew text had to keep his
eyes on the text without looking up. The one giving the translation and
interpretation had to look up and give the translation and interpretation without
looking at the text. This was done to make very clear the difference between
the actual words of the text, and the interpretation given in the Aramaic. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Targums were first forbidden to be written, but the
Law interpretations became so expressed as it if had been written. This was
usually true also of the Psalms and the prophets. Other portions were written
down and read in private from the beginnings.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Talmud </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is a Jewish work which contains the civil and
religious laws not found in the Pentateuch, with commentaries upon and
illustrations of these laws. The word means teaching or doctrine. It represents
the learning, teaching, opinions, and decisions of Jewish teachers over a
period of approximately 800 years, from 300 BC to 500 AD. It is in two parts;
the Mishna, the oral law; and the Gemara, the commentaries and illustrations.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Mishna</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This was begun by Hillel before the birth of Christ, and
was called the Second Law. Its chain of transmission was supposed to be from
Moses to Joshua, Joshua to the elders, the elders to the prophets, the prophets
to the men of the Great Synagogue, and by them to their successors to the 2nd
century AD. It is divided into six sections, each dealing with the following
general subjects. Seeds, Feasts, Women, Damages, Sacred Things, and
Purifications. It is written in Hebrew.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Gemara </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is the part of the Talmud which contains the notes,
commentaries and explanations and illustrations of the Mishna, and lots of
other information. It was written in Aramaic and completed about 500 AD. It had
2 forms. The Jerusalem Gemara, completed about 200 AD. The Babylonian Gemara
contains about 6,000 pages.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Midrash </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is basically a less formal explanation and exposition
of the Old Testament from a doctrinal and homiletical viewpoint. It is written
in Hebrew and Aramaic. It means investigation and interpretation. It differs
from the Targums in that it is not a translation, but a commentary. It differs
from the Talmud in that it does not deal with the oral law but with the written
law. It is divided into two parts: the Halakhah, and the Haggadah.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Halakhah </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is confined to the Pentateuch and gives explanation
and additions to the law and ritual. It covers cases which the law does not
cover. It gives decisions of Rabbis on controversial subjects.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Haggadah </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This covers the entire Old Testament and includes the
historical prophetical, and poetical sections. It is popular, and covers
history, tradition, stories, legends, parables, allegories, beliefs, customs;
much fanciful, much good. The most significant and flourishing use of this was
from 100 BC to 300 AD.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Septuagint</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is a translation of the Hebrew Old Testament into
the Greek language for the Greek speaking Jews of Alexandria, Egypt and other
locations. Its composition dates from 280 to 180 BC. Its importance could be
summed up in the following major points. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is probably the oldest attempt to reproduce any book
into another language. It is probably the oldest translation of the Hebrew Old
Testament into another language. It was the earliest attempt to establish union
between Hebrew speaking peoples and Greek speaking peoples. It gave the truths
of the isolated Hebrew language to the whole world through the Greek language. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It prepared the way for the people of the world to have
the entire Bible in one great universal language, Greek. When Philo quoted from
the Old Testament, he always used the Septuagint. Philo was a Jewish
philosopher and writer from Alexandria. It was commonly used in New Testament
times. Christ and other writers of the New Testament quoted from it freely.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It was accepted gladly by the Jews except those in the
schools and synagogues who held to the Hebrew language. It was accepted also
and used by the early church. It is still the text held by the Greek Catholic
Church. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It was the basis for other translations including Old
Latin, Egyptian, Ethiopic, Gothic, and Slavonic. Its oldest manuscripts, Aleph,
B, A, C, are 500 years older than the oldest Hebrew manuscripts of the Old
Testament. Therefore, it is the earliest witness of the original text of the
Old Testament.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Pseudepigraphical Writings </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>These are writings which claim biblical authorship or
time, but have never been accepted as Canonical. These fall into categories -
Old Testament Pseudepigraphical Writings and New Testament Pseudepigraphical
Writings. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Old Testament Pseudepigraphical Writings fall into
four categories - Apocalyptic books, Legendary books, Poetical books, and
Didactic books. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Appendix to Apocalyptic Books</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Book of Enoch </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It occurs in 2 books, I &amp; II Enoch.  It originated in
Palestine and comes from a Greek version of the Hebrew Scriptures. I Enoch was
written 163-63 BC. II Enoch was written AD1-50. It is divided into 3 sections;
introduction, the book, the epilogue. The introduction has 5 chapters, the book
5 parts, and then the epilogue. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Of great importance in I Enoch are the sections on: The
Fall of the Angels, Enoch’s journey into heaven and earth, what he saw and
heard, The Kingdom of Heaven, and The Second Advent. It gives probably the best
account of the development of Jewish doctrine in the last two centuries before
Christ. The first book is regarded as the Book of the Angels, then the second
being the Similitude. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some other subjects in the books of Enoch: The glory of
the Messiah, the subjugation of the kings of the earth to the Messiah, a long
account of Leviathan and Behemoth, the history of the world up to the Maccabean
Struggle, and the history of the world is set forth in ten successive week
periods. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Book of Similitudes, with revelations concerning
heaven and hell is probably the best part of the books of Enoch. The complete
books of Enoch exist in Ethiopic. The date most comfortably held on the books
of Enoch would be 205 BC.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Secrets of Enoch </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is a
rabbinic book, ascribed to Rabbi Ishmael, a figure in the rebellion of Bar
Kokba. Enoch is seen here as the Metatron.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Apocalypse of Baruch </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is divided into 7 sections. The basic nature of this
book is a revelation to Baruch, along with his answers, questions, and
observations about his prayers, fasting, and person. Some of the topics covered
in the book: The consequences of sin of our first parents. Information about
what body and what form the dead rise in. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The figurative language employed lends great assistance
to understanding the figurative language of the New Testament. The consequence
of sin is set forth as physical death. This was written after the fall of
Jerusalem, 70 AD.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Rest of the Words of Baruch. </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The main spokesman in the book, Jeremiah. This was
written by a Christian Jew in Palestine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Assumption of Moses.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>7-8 AD. Deals with the presentation of Moses activity
with Joshua preceding his death, then as account of the chronological sketch up
to Herod of history is referred to in Jude about the disputing for the body of
Moses.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Revelation of Moses.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Deals with the life of Adam and Eve after the death of
Abel up to the time of their deaths. Supposed to be a revelation of God to
Moses. There is no evidence of this being Christian in origin but rather
Jewish.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Ascension of Isaiah (about 68 AD). </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is called by the early Christian fathers and
especially Origen, The Apocryphon of Isaiah. Some of the basic concepts in the
book: Refers to demon possession of Manasseh who then would have Isaiah sawn
asunder. Discusses Isaiah’s retirement as in Bethlehem. There is some confusion
between the first and second coming of Christ. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Deals with the incarnation of Belial (god) into Nero, and
the persecution of the Apostles, with reference to one being a martyr. It sets
forth the time of the reign of the Anti-Christ as 1,335 days as computed by
Roman time, or 3 years, 7 months, and 27 days. There is reference made to the
Beloved descending into Sheol. There is an account of the martyrdom of Isaiah
by being sawn in two with a wooden sword. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Then the heart of the book on the Ascension of Isaiah is
given how he traveled all through the 7 heavens seeing different things in each
of them. In the atmosphere he saw the angels of the devil envying one another.
In the next, the throne with angels to the right and to the left, this
continuing through the 2, 3, 4, 5th, each getting more glorious. In the 6th, no
throne and no distinction in the angels. All were equal. In the 7th, he sees
God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The work of the Son is set forth as descending to earth,
taking on human form, being crucified through the influence of the Prince of
the World, then descending into Sheol, spoiling it, then ascending on high.
There is also reference to a miraculous birth.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The book reflects a knowledge of Roman affairs, at the
time of Nero’s fall, beyond what the normal individual in Palestine would know;
that Rome is usually held as the place of composition. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is made up of two parts but the Christian element
comes out in both. The Christian influence of early church type is shown in the
early expectancy of Christ’s return, the struggles between the Judaizers and
the Pauline Christians, the emphasis on the 12 apostles, the omission of all
reference to Paul. It does not give any account of the powers and
principalities of Satan’s kingdom.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Sibylline Oracles: written in Greek hexameters (180BC
to 350 AD) </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It consists of 12 books, the first 2 completed by the end
of the second century by a Jewish (probably) Christian. Basic concepts found in
the books: </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Heathen myths concerning the first ages of man welded
with Old Testament views. The third book contains information dated to
different times: some to 160 BC and some to 31 BC. The rest to later periods of
time. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The third book falls into 3 parts. The ancient scheme
cast into Jewish mold. Uranus becomes Noah. Saturn, Titan, and Japetus become
Shem, Ham, and Japeth. The Rebellion of the Titans becomes the Tower of Babel.
Then the history of the world is told with the Kingdom of Israel and David
occupying a focal point. This has to do with heathen oracles interwoven in
Jewish scheme. This is anti-heathen, polemical, and apocalyptic. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Books #4, 5, 9, and 12 were written by Egyptian Jews from
80 AD to the third century AD. Book #6 is of Christian origin. It dates to
second half of the second century. Books #3, 10, and 11 have Jewish portions
but Christian authorship. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The term Sibyl itself was a name given by the Greeks and
Romans to a prophetess inspired by Apollo or by some other deity. There were
several Sibyls famous in history. Herophile, the Sibyl who prophesied the
Trojan War. The Sibyl of Cumaean responsible for a series of books taken by
Tarquin the Proud, written in Greek, known as the Sibylline Books. This Sibyl
was also in Virgil’s Aeneid where she prophesied Aeneas’ future and guided him
to the underworld. She is said to have offered the books at a price to King
Tarquin who refused to pay (9 of them). She burned 3 of them then and offered 6
at the same price, again he refused. She then offered the last 3 which he
bought.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Fourth Book of Esdras known as II Esdras in the
Apocrypha. </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It was written in Greek originally and translated into 5
languages. It was composed at the end of the first century. The basic thrust is
the mystery of Israel’s fall and restoration. The book is a series of visions
depicting various things about Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Vision #1 Uriel is sent by God to reveal to Ezra His plan
for Israel. Vision #2: Purpose was to bring out the limited understanding of
man through a series of questions. Vision #3 The account of creation in more
detail than in Genesis and a full description of Leviathan and Behemoth. Ezra
is shown the heavenly Zion. Also the place of punishment is shown as well as
Paradise. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Vision #4. This is a vision of a woman weeping,
interpreted as Zion. Vision #5. Eagle appears with 3 heads and 12 wings,
picturing the Roman Empire. A lion appears and destroys the eagle. Vision #6
This begins with the account of the coming of Christ. Vision #7: This one
begins with a rewriting of these books by dictation given by Ezra. Then 70
selected sacred books are retained. This was apparently written after the
capture of Jerusalem by Titus, probably 81-96 AD.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The place of the Apocrypha in relation to Bibles and
versions.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>During early Christian centuries most Greek and Latin
church fathers such as Irenaeus, Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria and Cyprian,
none of whom knew Hebrew, quoted passages from the Apocrypha as “Scripture,”
“Divine Scripture,” and “inspired.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Only an occasional father made any effort at all to learn
the limits of the Hebrew Old Testament (canon). The Apocrypha by meaning is
“hidden” and “secret.” This produced different interpretations of this meaning.
It was thought as “hidden” in the sense of known only by the initiated and
therefore of an esoteric nature. It was held by others as “hidden” in the sense
of the great value of it, that is the great import being hidden within its
contents.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The designation “Apocrypha” went through various usages.
It went from the one mentioned, to include any book that was of non-canonical
status. Then it moved back to a more specific usage referring to the 14-15
books normally appearing in the version of the Catholic Bible. There was also
in the mind of men a distinction made between Hebrew canonical books and other
works, including the Apocrypha which were just deemed Scripture.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the fourth century many Greek fathers came to
Apocrypha recognize the difference between the books in the Hebrew canon and
the rest of the books still held as Scripture, (Eusebius, Athanasius, Cyril of
Jerusalem, Gregory of Nazianzus, Amphilochius, Epiphanius).</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the Synod of Jerusalem in 1672 the books of Wisdom,
Tobit, Tobit, Bel and the Dragon, Susanna, Maccabees, and Ecclesiasticus were
designated as canonical. In the Latin church, the council of Hippo, 393 AD and
the council of Carthage, 397 and 419 AD authorized their use as Scripture.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When Jerome wrote the Latin Vulgate, he separated them
from the Hebrew canon Scriptures, but later his prefatory notes were deleted.
In the 14th century, John Wycliffe, produced the first English version of the
Bible. This included all the Apocrypha except II Esdras. However, he noted they
were without authority. II Maccabees was an issue in the reformation because it
deals with the controversial subjects of Purgatory, efficacy of prayers and
Masses for the dead.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first real treatise on the Apocrypha from a
Protestant point of view was by Andreas Bodenstein, commonly known as
Carlstadt, in 1520 in the Latin treatise, “De Canonicis Scripturis Libellus,”
(published at Wittenberg). He distinguishes them from the Hebrew canon of
Scripture but refers to them as “holy writings...and not to be despised”. This
he relates to the first of 2 groups into which he divides the Apocrypha. The
second group, I and II Esdras, Baruch, Prayer of Manasseh, Additions to Daniel,
he says are worthy of a censor ban.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first edition of the Swiss-German Bible of the church
in Zurich, 1527-29, is written in 6 volumes, the fifth containing or being, the
Apocrypha. They are stated as being “books which are not reckoned as Biblical
by the ancients nor found among the Hebrews.” The Swiss Reformer, Johannes
Oecolampadius, declared in a formal statement issued in 1530 AD that “...we do
not allow them divine authority with the others.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Council of Trent on April 8, 1546 gave in the eyes of
the Roman Catholic Church the first infallible approval to the Apocrypha. It
also pronounced a decree of anathema on any who refused them as the canon of
Scripture. The Prayer of Manasseh and the books of I and II Esdras, however
were not included in this official recognition.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In England, the Protestants were unified in that they all
rejected the Apocrypha as canonical but they did differ as to how the Apocrypha
could be used. Some looked at it as one would look at the value of a sermon,
while others used it as a lectionary. The Puritans had an aversion to any human
book that didn’t have a place in the Hebrew and Greek canons of Scripture. This
led to the publishing of Bible which did not contain the Apocrypha.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The earliest copies of the English Bible which excluded
the Apocrypha are certain Geneva Bible printed in 1599 in the Low Countries.
George Abbot, Archbishop of Canterbury and one of the translators of the King
James Version of the Bible in 1615, gave public notice that no copy of the
Bible was to be bound or sold which did not contain the Apocrypha. However,
Bibles began showing up without it in 1616, 1618, 1620, 1622, 1627, 1629, 1630,
1633. There was a growing demand for these.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Reasons for rejection of the Apocrypha into the canon
of Scripture</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is universally admitted that they never had a place in
the Hebrew canon. Every card indexing catalog of the Canon of Scripture
excludes them. They were never quoted in the New Testament either by Christ or His
apostles although they were in existence at that time.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Josephus expressly excludes them limiting the number of
divinely inspired books to 22 which he enumerates. Philo, the great Jewish
philosopher of Alexandria wrote largely and quoted frequently from the Old
Testament but never from the Apocrypha. He didn’t even mention them. They are
not found in any catalog of canonical books made during the first 4 centuries
AD.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jerome declared for the strict Hebrew canon and rejected
the authority of the entire Apocrypha in the most emphatic manner. Divine inspiration
and authority is claimed by none of the writers and is disclaimed by some. The
books contain many historical, chronological and geographical errors and
distortions of the Old Testament narratives, contradicting themselves, the
Bible, and secular history.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>No prophets were connected with the Apocrypha, neither do
they contain a true prophetic element. The “succession of prophets” had ceased.
They teach doctrines and uphold practices which are directly opposed to the
canon of Scripture. They have a definite weakness of style, stiffness, lack of
originality and an artificial expression when compared with canonical books.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Much of the literature is legendary and contains
absurdities. Tobit 11:9, II Mac 2:3-5. The so-called miracles, deeds, and
descriptions of persons are grotesque and silly, Tobit 5:13-17; 1-9. The
spiritual and moral level is far below that of the Old Testament. They are
worlds apart. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The hooks were written much later than the Old Testament
and after the Hebrew Old Testament was closed. The canon was closed in about
425 BC. They were permitted to be read for instruction but never considered
canonical by any organization, group of men, or prominent man until the Roman
Catholic Council of Trent 1546 and then by a small majority. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Christian Church received from the Jewish Church only
the Old Testament Scriptures and not any of the Apocrypha. The use of the term
“Scripture” by Christ and the apostles in the New Testament makes it very clear
that the “limits” of the Old Testament Hebrew canon had already been long fixed
by the time of their lives and ministries. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>While there were Targums for the canonical books of the
Old Testament, no such Targums existed except a possible manuscript on the book
of Tobit. The difference between the Apocrypha and the Old Testament Scriptures
can be felt rather than defined by their contents they are self-condemned.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Reasons for the origin of the New Testament Apocrypha.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A desire for more details and definite knowledge of
Christ than communicated by the evangelists and preachers obtained from oral
instruction. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A popular desire for fuller information than that
occurring in the 4 Gospels This was usually in relation to Christ’s birth,
childhood, life of Mary, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Doctrinal issues such as the humanity or deity of Christ
prompted writers to emerge with their heretical views and support of their
views in writing. This was designed to add credibility to their views. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Apocryphal Acts arose probably during the time when
the Canonical Acts was not yet recognized as being alone authoritatively. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The New Testament Apocrypha originated to glorify the
true Christianity by the unlawful means of pious fraud.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They also originated to fill up supposed lacks and chasms
in the canonical writings.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Apocryphal Epistles </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord: An answer by the Lord supposedly to Abgarus,
King of Osroene, saying that He could not leave Palestine but that after the
ascension, He would send a messenger back to heal him.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Clementine Homilies. Work of fiction attributed to
Clement of Rome. This is dated at approximately the end of the second century
or the beginning of the third century.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Epistle from Laodicea. A reference to a letter of
such nature in Col. 4:16 apparently was the source of someone writing an
epistle and forging it. It is written in Latin consisting of 20 verses. It is
mentioned in the Muratorian Fragment (170 AD). By the end of the fourth century
it had wide circulation. By now it is almost universally rejected as being
spurious. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Lost Epistle to the Corinthians. A reference to an
epistle which apparently was lost. In 1 Cor. 5:9 is the biblical basis held to
for the Lost Epistle of the Corinthians. In the fifth century after 1
Corinthians in the text, this short manuscript was included besides one from
the Corinthians to Paul. These are found in Armenian and Syrian versions and
they date from about 200 AD occurring in the versions in the fifth and fourth
centuries respectively. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Epistle to the Alexandrines. This is mentioned only
in the Muratorian Fragment. This epistle has not come down to us today. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Letters of Paul to Senaca. This is written in Latin. They
contain 6 letters attributed to Paul and 8 letters attributed to Senaca.
Scholars believe that this correspondence was probably forged in the fourth
century. This correspondence had a wide circulation in the Middle Ages apparently
its purpose being to recommend Senaca to Christian readers or Christianity to
the students of Senaca.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Jewish Doctrine of Angels - A Masterpiece of
Distortion</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If the true doctrine of the Angelic Conflict is vital to
understanding the plan of God of earth, surely the distortion of the doctrine
would lead one to the depths of blindness. This will be seen as the case for
the nation of Israel, the Jews. Some of the greatest distortions of doctrines
by Rabbinical authorities falls within the scope of the doctrine of Angels and
Demons. The following will set forth categorically the Jewish view basically of
these doctrines during the New Testament times.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The first category of Angels are the Unnumbered Hosts.
These are not the Angel-Princes (as will be defined later).</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The creation of these “Hosts.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They were either created on Day Two or Day Five of
creation. Every day new angels of this type are created, whose purpose is to
praise God, then they pass away in a fiery stream. They go to Lamentations 3:23
to seek to support this. Also each Word spoken by God is an angel. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They have a very intricate system (specific) of numbering
these Hosts, especially relating to the Nation Israel. There are 12 Mazzaloth
(signs of the Zodiac). Each of these have 30 chiefs of armies. Each chief has
30 legions. Each legion has 30 leaders. Each leader has 30 captains. Each
captain with 30 under him. Each of these have 365,000 stars (angels) under him.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The passage, Isaiah 14:12ff. is referred to by Jewish
belief as relating to Nebuchadnezzar. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They have a system of 7 heavens (each 500 years thick,
etc.)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Vilon - in
which is the Sun. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Requia - in
which the sun shines and the moon, stars, and planets are set. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Shechaquim - in
which is the millstone which made the manna for the pious.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Zebhul - in
this realm is the Upper Jerusalem, the Temple, and the Altar: in this sphere
Michael, the Chief Angel Prince, offers sacrifices. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Maon - this is
the Realm of the Angels of Ministry or Host. They sing by night.  They are
silent by day, this is to honor Israel. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Machons - this
is where all the snow, hail, noxious dews, receptacles for water, the wind
chamber, mist and fire chamber, mist and fire chamber are.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Araboth - this
is where Justice, Judgment and Righteousness are; also here are the treasuries
of Life, Peace, Blessing. Here also are the souls of the righteous, the spirits
and souls who are to be born in the future, and the dew stored for raising the
dead. Also here abides the Ophanim, Seraphim, living creatures, ministering
angels, Throne of Glory, and over them is enthroned the Great King.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'><u>The Second Classification of
Angels are the Angel-Princes.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They cannot seem to determine the exact number of
Angel-Princes.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The following general factors are held: </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>There are 70
nations composing the world, each with an Angel-Prince.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Each of these
Angel-Princes plead their cause with God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Therefore, all
but one of the Angel-Princes are basically hostile to the Nation Israel and
therefore not quite good angels.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Each of these
angels will be cast down when their respective nation is destroyed.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>There are 4
chief Angel-Princes which surround the Throne of God; Michael, Gabriel,
Rephael, and Uriel.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>There is a
fifth special type of Chief called the Metatron. This one is under the throne
and before it.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>In the Targum
–Pseudo-Jonathon there is a list of six principle Angels--Michael, Gabrial,
Metatron, Yophiel, Uriel and Yophyophyah.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>The Book of
Enoch lists 6 principle angels but mentions 7.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The five special types of chief angels looked at from the
Jewish viewpoint. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Metatron</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Corresponds to the Logos or Angel of the Face. He is the
Representative of God. He is not to be adored, neither does he have power to
forgive sins, neither is he to be seen as a Mediator. A Rabbi was supposed to
have seen Metatron sitting in heaven and immediately inferred this to mean
there were two supreme powers. Immediately to disprove this to the Rabbi,
Metatron received 60 fiery lashes to prove his inferiority, from another angel.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Metatron is called the Great Scribe, the Prince of
this World. He is called “the Youth,” the “Little God,” and had 7 names like
the Almighty and shared His Majesty. He was designated as the “Prince of the
Face,” sat in the innermost chamber, other angels on the outside.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Metatron is recorded as having done many things. Showed
the unknown to Moses. Instructed infants who died without knowledge. He was
supposed to have shown Moses the whole land of Palestine. He was the one who
went before Israel in the wilderness. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Michael, the Great Prince </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He stands at the Right Hand of God. He is the Prince of
Wisdom. He is the Prince of Jerusalem, the representative of Israel. He offers
sacrifices upon the Heavenly altars; sometimes souls of the pious, sometimes
lambs of fire. He is not to be invoked by Israel, even though he is their
angel. He attempted to intervene before the destruction of Jerusalem but
failed. The origin of his name came from the Song of Moses at the Red Sea.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He had many great feats. He delivered Abraham from fiery
oven of Nimrod. He delivered the three Hebrew children from fiery furnace. He
was one of 3 angels who announced the birth of Isaac to Abram. The other two
were Gabriel and Rephael. He also saved Lot. Michael and Gabriel wrote down
Jacob as one through whom would come the Seed. God confirmed it. Michael and
Gabriel were “friends of the bridegroom” at the wedding of Adam and Eve. He
prepared the coffin for Moses: Gabriel covered his (Moses’) face with a cloth.
In the world of the future, Michael would bless the fruit of Eden, hand them to
Gabriel who would pass them on to David, etc. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Gabriel - “the Hero of God”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Represents judgment. In executing judgment, he did many
things. He destroyed Sodom. He struck the servants of the Egyptian princess who
took Moses from the water. They didn’t want her to do it. He killed the men
standing by the fiery furnace. He smote the army of Sennacherib (185,000). He
instructed Moses on how to make the Golden Candlestick. In the coming world,
Gabriel will hunt and slay Leviathan. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Uriel</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Means “God is my light” and stands to the left side of
the Throne </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Rephael</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Means “God heals” and stands behind the Throne.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Ministering Angels and Their Ministry</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They are divided into two classes, those praising God -
594,000 myriads and those carrying out His commands.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>The Activity of the Ministering Angels </i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Angel performed the service at the first sacrifice of
Adam. They cut the hands and feet off the serpent (which was a camel-like
animal), so they said. They appeared to Abraham as a baker, a sailor, and an
Arab. 120,000 of them danced for Jacob when he left Laban. 4,000 myriad were
ready to fight Esau if he attacked Jacob. 22,000 came to Mount Sinai and stood
by Israel when they were afraid of the Voice of God and retreated 12 miles. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They were told to shut the doors of heaven when Moses was
about ready to pray a prayer he learned from Sagsagel which would have
prevented his death. They are designed to punish apostate Israel. A good and
evil angel always accompanied man. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>These angels formed in Rabbinical circles sort of a
consultative Sanhedrin. God always consulted the angels before he did
something. This was true regarding creation of man. The angels interceded for
Adam and requested that Moses and Aaron who were sinless also be punished with
Adam, as the just and unjust must have one fate. They interceded for Isaac and
dropped three tears on the blade of Abraham which blunted its edge.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>The Limitation of the Power of the Angels </i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They are pure spirit beings without sense, hatred, envy,
jealousy without sin. They know much about the future. They have part in Divine
Light. They live on beams of Glory. They are not limited as to movement. They
are inferior to Israel.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They were unable to name the animals in Eden. The angel
that wrestled with Jacob lost. Their nature, not their power, is what separated
them from man. No angel could do two messages at the same time.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They are creatures blindly doing God’s work. They are
liable to punishments. God had informed the angels that the creation of man was
Superior to theirs and it made them envious. Adam was really nearer to God than
the angels, and... Of course, Israel was too.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>The Good and Evil Character of the Angels</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Angels are not absolutely good. (The view of the Rabbis).
When God consulted the angels about the Creation of man, the angels opposed it.
Therefore, God kept secret that man would sin. The angels conspired for the
fall of man.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The angels had an Accusation ministry. They accused
Abraham for not offering a sacrifice to God at the Weaning of Isaac. They
badmouthed Ishmael that he might die from thirst. They opposed Moses’ ascension
into Heaven. They opposed Moses’ writing down the Law. They became the friends
of Moses when he showed them the Law was only for those with sinful desires,
therefore excluding them. When Manasseh tried to repent, the angels closed the
gates so his prayers couldn’t get to God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>The Names of Angels</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Rabbinic Doctrine of Satan and the fall of the Angels</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>General Principles of Rabbinic Doctrine of Satan. This
section of Rabbinic Theology is even more pronounced than that of angels. In
Rabbinic writings none of the New Testament names given to Satan occur except
the word, Satan. There is no mention of a Kingdom of Satan. Satan is the enemy
of man, not the enemy of God and good. They hold a threefold expression of
Satan. Satan or Sammael - Person as the Accuser. Yetser ha-Ra evil impulse
personified – Seducer. Angel of Death (Accuser, Tempter, and Punisher).</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Fall of Satan and his Angels</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This took place not before but after the creation of man.
The reason for the fall of Satan and the angels was jealousy and envy by the
angels. The fall of man is not traced to the agency of Satan directly.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There was a dispute in heaven among the angels and God
over the creation of man. While the dispute continued God quietly created man,
then addressed the angels with, “Man is made, why do you dispute?” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Therefore, they plotted the fall of Adam because of his
supremacy. Sammael was the most distinguished above the Seraphim and living
creatures. The angels who fell with Satan were only those who were under his
command and authority. They came to earth and disguised as a serpent, an animal
like a camel with hands and feet and speech. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Several explanations are given as reasons for the
temptation of the servant. One is that the Devil had nothing to do with it: the
serpent wanted to trick Eve and Adam, so Adam would die being responsible and
he could then marry Eve.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan, or Sammael, as the Accuser of man is related as
accusing Abraham to God, therefore God tests Abraham to prove him. Satan, or
Sammael, as the Seducer -- this is a rationalistic advance, making the person
into an evil inclination. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Talmud directly expresses that God created the Yetser
Ha-Ra in man as he was before the fall. This is supposed to come from Gen. 2:7.
This evil inclination of man’s nature was absolutely necessary to continue in
the world and was a neutralizer of fear when in trouble. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As the Seducer many things were attributed to Satan or
this Evil inclination. Satan appeared before David on the house top as a bird,
when he rose up and shot at it, Bath-Sheba looked up, David saw her beauty and
went on from there to sin. He made the coffin of Moses appear before the
children of Israel in a Cloud.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Satan, as the Enemy of Man</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As the enemy of man, Satan seeks to hurt and destroy him.
Satan is the Angel of Death. However, he does not have absolute power. When
Israel took on the Law at Sinai this broke his sway over them, but the golden
calf incident nullified this blessing. There were six people over whom the
angel of Death, Satan, had no power Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron, Miriam
and some include Benjamin. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He temporarily disrupts God’s plan by breaking
concentration. Satan climbed up a tree and shook it, David went out and climbed
up a ladder to check it out. When he did, he broke a rung in the ladder and
this broke his chain of holy thoughts.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Doctrine of Evil Spirits according to Jewish,
Rabbinical Theology.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The General Characteristics of the Evil Spirits; They are
cunning and malicious. They are not absolutely evil. Contact with them is
dangerous. They often turn out to be kind and helpful. They can be rendered
inoperative at times.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Their Creation and Origin </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They were created on the eve of the Sabbath (views differ
however). They are continually multiplying. Some are the offspring of Eve and
male spirits, others of Adam and female spirits, or with the Queen of female
spirits called Lilith. This is one of the reasons for Adam having no children
for 130 years until the birth of Seth, he was under a ban. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They propagate themselves. They also propagate by passing
through a four-fold transformation from: Viper to vampire to thorns and
thistles to Shedim. After finally reaching the Shedim they can occur in many
forms including that of the form of men. This process of transformation takes
about 28 years. Some of them have defects such as blindness, like the one who
fell over a bush when chasing a Rabbi, and perished. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They have special places where they like to stay,
particularly in dirty places. They could be conquered by the “Ineffable Name.”
They could be banished by certain forms and words written or worn such as in
the amulets, which they wore. The Queen of the Female Spirits has a following
of 180,000. These evil spirits are everywhere, in bread crumbs, in the oil in
lamps, in water you drink, in diseases, in the air, in the room, day and night.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Their Classifications and Designations </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They are arranged into two basic classes, male and
female. The King of the male class of evil spirits is Ashmedai. The Queen of
the female class of evil spirits is Lilith.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The other evil spirits are divided as follows: </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:27.0pt;text-indent:0in'>The Morning
spirits: Tsaphrire</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:27.0pt;text-indent:0in'>The Midday
spirits: Tihare</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:27.0pt;text-indent:0in'>The Evening
Spirits: Telane </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:27.0pt;text-indent:0in'>The Night
spirits: Lilin</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>A Specific look at the Leadership of the Evil Spirits.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Ashmedia the king of the demons or evil spirits. He
is pictured as strong, immense in size, cunning and malignant. He sometimes
does good. He may be rendered serviceable or at your disposal by the use of the
“Ineffable Name.” Ashmedia was always said to flee at the sight of the signet
ring of Solomon.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Lilith - the queen of the Female Spirits. She is the
queen of Zemargad, the land of Zemargad being Sheba. She is usually presented
as a fair woman, but usually one with wild flowing hair.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Habits of the Shedim </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Many are only personifications of evil. Therefore, many
spirits are diseases such as croup, asthma, rabies, stomach disorders. They
were often localized such as at Samaria and Tiberias. They were also used in
magic cures of illness. This would be the demon removing the illness he had
incurred in the person. In other words, demon induced illness removed by the
demon. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sometimes they used Biblical verses to expel the Shedim,
sometimes other things. Demons could imitate and do anything that the great men
and prophets would do. This is one of the reasons why the Jews ascribed the
works of Christ to the prince of demons, Beelzebub. Legions of demons lie
around waiting for an error of man. There are certain demons called familiar
spirits who taught the Rabbis. There was Shed Joseph. There was Shed Jonathan.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Rabbinical Views about Demon Possession and Those
Possessed</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>From the Writings of Josephus </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Josephus states that the disorder of Saul was due to
demonic influence. Josephus states that the much wisdom, learning, and
achievements of Solomon with his expelling of demons was due to the use of
incantations, and that the very formulas used by Solomon were still known in
Josephus’ time. A certain Eleazar was supposed to cast a demon out of a man in
the presence of Vespasian and his army by following one of the prescribed
formulas of Solomon.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Rabbinic Views </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One view is that demons are the souls of the wicked, with
specific mechanics being that the backbone or spine of a person who didn’t bow
to God became a Shed or demon. Rabbis viewed demons under several names: evil
spirits, unclean spirits. A demoniac is called a Gebher Shediyin. The demons
are said to propagate themselves, eat and drink.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are two basic views that hold most of the
Rabbinical thinking on this subject. Demons enter into and take possession of
men. This is the cause for many diseases. Leaving the hands unwashed is just a
great big invitation to legions of demons. (Apparently this implies that they
enter the body this way.)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Magic and Magicians</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Egypt was designated as the home of magic. The power of
witchcraft and magic was supposed to have no control or power over the nation
of Israel as they adhered to the Law. The nation of Israel was forbidden to
have any connection specifically with witchcraft, magic, soothsaying, etc. God
had particularly banned this. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Talmud ascribes the miracles of Jesus to Magic. Jesus
had learned this magic in Egypt during his stay there. (Talmud) The way Jesus
brought this magic back to Palestine was by putting it under his skin. He did
this because everyone was searched when leaving so they wouldn’t take any of
their magic out of the land.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Rabbinic View of Many Christians </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Jews did not deny the Spiritual Gifts and miracles in
the early church; they just relegated them to magic. It was distorted by Jewish
Christians who apparently played around with demonism and therefore cast a
suspicious shadow on all of Christendom. Jewish Christians were consigned to
eternal punishment in Gehinnom and even their circumcision was taken away.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Classes of Magicians according to the Talmud </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Baal Obh:
conjuror of the dead. Spoke from under the armpit of the dead body. The dead
might be called up through a process that would bring the apparent person up
feet first. The dead might be called up through magical means using a skull be
made to answer.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Yideoni:
uttered oracles by putting a certain bone into the mouth. This was the second
class of magician.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Chabar: this
was the serpent (snake) charmer. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Meonen: this
was the magician who could tell what days were lucky and unlucky.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Searcher after
the Dead: this was the magician who spent his time on graves attempting to make
contact with the dead. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Black Art: this
was practiced either through demons or magic. This was done by incantations,
using a knife with a black handle, using a cup of incantation, magic by the
thumb.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Demonism and Disease </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There were four things that were dangerous because of
demons. Walking between two palm trees, if the space was wider than 4 cubits.
To borrow drinking water. To walk over water that has been poured out, unless
it has been spat in, covered up, or you are barefooted. The shadow of the moon,
of certain trees, and of other objects because demons like to stay there.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Many actual diseases were caused by direct Demoniac
possession. Leprosy, Rabies, Heart disease, Madness, Asthma, and Croup. Magical
cures.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Wearing of amulets; these were pieces of parchment on
which certain magical words were written, or small bundles of plants or herbs.
This had to be accompanied by the stating of the demon’s name that you wanted
removed or the disease. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Remedies against danger from drinking water were saying
verses of Scripture in which the word “voice” (Qol) occurred seven times. You
could also say: “Be cured of the.”To cast out demons certain formulas were
given. Sometimes the demon was invoked, sometimes the demon was threatened.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Observation will be made at this point from a correct
doctrinal basis that the entire stage was set by Satan in blinding the eyes of
the Jews in the Doctrine of Angels so there was an almost exact counterfeit of
each thing that Christ would come to the world to do. All the antithetical
positions were firmly drawn, therefore when Christ came, did His miracles and
finished His work, There was some former distortion of the plan of God, by the
Greatest deceiver of the Universe, Satan.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the true doctrine of the Angelic Conflict as given in
the Scripture we realize that a large part is given over to the Doom of Satan,
and that of man when he lines up volitionally and finally with Satan. This
factor brings us to this important area of Eternal Punishment. According to Job
one of the major points of contention between God and Satan has to do with the
eternal confirmed destiny of Satan and those who fell with him. We shall now look
at this section of Rabbinical teaching on Eternal Punishment.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Eternal Punishment as Viewed in Rabbinical Teaching</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The First Rabbinical thought came from the schools of
thought; the Schools of Shammai and Hillel. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Shammai school thinking: Divide mankind into three
classes. Perfectly righteous - sealed for eternal life. Perfectly wicked -
sealed for eternal life. Intermediate class - those who go down to Gehinnom,
moan, and come back again. (Has the Purgatory connotations). They quote Daniel
12:2 referring to the judgment after Resurrection. This position is held
basically by the school of Hillel. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hillel school thinking: Sinners of Israel as well as
Gentiles are sent to Gehenna for suffering for 12 months, then their bodies and
souls are consumed and their ashes scattered out under the feet of the
righteous. However, some are confined there throughout the ages. This school of
thought sort of emphasizes the Mercy of God in that not all are sent there
forever.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Synagogue teaching on Eternal Punishment </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The doctrine of Eternal Punishment was basically held
throughout the synagogues throughout the first century. In the second century
Rabbinic teaching and position changed. The concept that arose here was the
teaching of the terminating of punishment in Gehenna, either by release or by
the heat of the sun consuming the wicked. In the third century, one Rabbi
maintained that the fires of Gehenna did not hurt the sinners among the Jews.
The concept o also that God will eventually destroy all evil.</p>
