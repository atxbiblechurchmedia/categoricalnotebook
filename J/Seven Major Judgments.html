<h2><a name="_D-Seven_Major_Judgments"></a>Seven Major Judgments </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Judgment of Jesus Christ For Sins on The Cross</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The greatest judgment of human history was our Lord Jesus
Christ being judged for the sins of mankind on the Cross. 2 Cor. 5:21; 1 Peter
2:24; 1 Peter 3:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that
we might become the righteousness of God in Him.” (2 Corinthians 5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, so that
we might die to sin and live to righteousness; for by His wounds you were
healed.” (1 Peter 2:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For Christ also died for sins once for all, the just for the
unjust, so that He might bring us to God, having been put to death in the
flesh, but made alive in the spirit;” (1 Peter 3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Believer’s Self-Judgment</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers are to judge themselves or evaluate themselves
and confess or cite their known sins to God the Father when out of fellowship per
1 John 1:9. We simply name our sins that we know of because Jesus Christ has
already been judged for all of them on the Cross. 1 Cor. 11:31; Psalms 32:5;
Psalms 51:1-5; Isaiah 43:25-28.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But if we judged ourselves rightly, we would not be judged.”
(1 Corinthians 11:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“I acknowledged my sin to You, And my iniquity I did not hide;
I said, &quot;I will confess my transgressions to the LORD&quot;; And You
forgave the guilt of my sin. Selah.” (Psalms 32:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the choir director. A Psalm of David, when Nathan the
prophet came to him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba. Be gracious to me, O
God, according to Your lovingkindness; According to the greatness of Your
compassion blot out my transgressions. Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity And
cleanse me from my sin.” (Psalms 51:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I, even I, am the one who wipes out your transgressions
for My own sake, And I will not remember your sins. &quot;Put Me in
remembrance, let us argue our case together; State your cause, that you may be
proved right.” (Isaiah 43:25-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Judgment Seat of Christ </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All Church Age believers’ spiritual production of divine
good and human good will be evaluated after the Rapture of the Church at the
Judgment Seat of Christ. This will occur while the Tribulation is occurring on
earth. Human good will be removed as unacceptable to God. 1 Cor. 3:11-16; Rom.
14:10. See category on the <a href="#_Judgment_Seat_of">Judgment Seat of Christ</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For no man can lay a foundation other than the one which is
laid, which is Jesus Christ. Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold,
silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, each man's work will become evident;
for the day will show it because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire
itself will test the quality of each man's work. If any man's work which he has
built on it remains, he will receive a reward. If any man's work is burned up,
he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire. Do
you not know that you are a temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in
you?” (1 Corinthians 3:11-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But you, why do you judge your brother? Or you again, why do
you regard your brother with contempt? For we will all stand before the
judgment seat of God.” (Romans 14:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b><span style='color:black'>Judgment of Living
Tribulation Unbelieving Jews </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>The judgment of the living Tribulation
unbelieving Jews will occur at the Second Advent and is called the Baptism of
Fire. All unbelievers will be cast off the earth. All believers will continue
alive into the Millennium. </span>Luke 3:16-17; 2 Thess. 1:7-9; <span
style='color:black'>Ezek. 20:32-38. See category on the </span><a
href="#_D-Baptism_of_Fire">Baptism of Fire</a><span style='color:black'>.</span></p>

<p class=Verses>“John answered and said to them all, “As for me, I baptize you
with water; but One is coming who is mightier than I, and I am not fit to untie
the thong of His sandals; He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. “His
winnowing fork is in His hand to thoroughly clear His threshing floor, and to
gather the wheat into His barn; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable
fire.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Luke 3:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and to give relief to you who are afflicted and to us as well
when the Lord Jesus will be revealed from heaven with His mighty angels in
flaming fire, dealing out retribution to those who do not know God and to those
who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. These will pay the penalty of
eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of
His power,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Thessalonians 1:7-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;As I entered into judgment with your fathers in the
wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will enter into judgment with you,&quot;
declares the Lord GOD.” (Ezekiel 20:36, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“and I will purge from you the rebels and those who transgress
against Me; I will bring them out of the land where they sojourn, but they will
not enter the land of Israel. Thus you will know that I am the LORD.” (Ezekiel
20:38, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b><span style='color:black'>Judgment of Living
Tribulation Unbelieving Gentiles </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The judgement of the living Tribulation unbelieving Gentiles
will also occur at the Second Advent as part of the Baptism of <span
style='color:black'>Fire. In Matthew 25:32-33, the sheep are the believers and
the goats are the unbelievers. </span>Matt. 3:11-12; <span style='color:black'>Matt.
25:31-46. See category on the </span><a href="#_D-Baptism_of_Fire">Baptism of
Fire</a><span style='color:black'>.</span></p>

<p class=Verses>““As for me, I baptize you with water for repentance, but He
who is coming after me is mightier than I, and I am not fit to remove His  sandals;
He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. “His winnowing fork is in
His hand, and He will thoroughly clear His threshing floor; and He will gather
His wheat into the barn, but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew
3:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;All the nations will be gathered before Him; and He will
separate them from one another, as the shepherd separates the sheep from the
goats; and He will put the sheep on His right, and the goats on the left.”
(Matthew 25:32-33, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b><span style='color:black'>Judgment of Satan and all
Fallen Angels</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>Satan and all fallen angels
will be cast into the Lake of Fire forever at the end of the Millennium. They
were sentenced before mankind was created to resolve the Angelic Conflict. Our
Lord Jesus Christ pronounced their sentence before time began, but its
execution will not be carried out until the end of human history.</span><span
style='color:red'> </span>Matt. 25:41; Rev. 20:8-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Then He will also say to those on His left, 'Depart from
Me, accursed ones, into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil
and his angels;” (Matthew 25:41, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four
corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for the war; the
number of them is like the sand of the seashore. And they came up on the broad
plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city,
and fire came down from heaven and devoured them. And the devil who deceived
them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the
false prophet are also; and they will be tormented day and night forever and
ever.” (Revelation 20:8-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b><span style='color:black'>Judgment of All Unbelievers</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='color:black'>All unbelievers from the
beginning of time will be resurrected at the end of the Millennium and judged
according to their works at the Great White Throne Judgment. </span>This will
include the unbelievers alive at the end of the Millennium. <span
style='color:black'>They will not be judged for their sins because Jesus Christ
was judged for all of mankind’s sins on the Cross. They will be judged based on
their human good and works, which will never be good enough to match the
perfect absolute righteousness of God. As a result, they will all be cast into
the Lake of Fire for eternity because of their rejection of Jesus Christ as
Savior</span>. Rev. 20:11-15.<span style='color:red'> </span><span
style='color:black'>See category on the </span><a href="#_Judgment,_Great_White">Judgment,
Great White Throne</a><span style='color:black'>.</span></p>

<p class=Verses>“Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat upon it, from
whose presence earth and heaven fled away, and no place was found for them. And
I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books
were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life; and the
dead were judged from the things which were written in the books, according to
their deeds. And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and Hades
gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged, every one of them
according to their deeds. Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of
fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire. And if anyone's name was not
found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.” (Revelation
20:11-15, NASB)</p>
