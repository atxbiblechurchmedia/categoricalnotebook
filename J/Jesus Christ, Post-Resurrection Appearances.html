Appearances</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Pre-Ascension Appearances</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord appeared to Mary Magdalene. She had more
doctrine in her soul than any other woman in her time. John 20:15-17; Mark
16:9-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Jesus said to her, &quot;Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are
you seeking?&quot; Supposing Him to be the gardener, she said to Him,
&quot;Sir, if you have carried Him away, tell me where you have laid Him, and I
will take Him away.&quot; Jesus said to her, &quot;Mary!&quot; She turned and
said to Him in Hebrew, &quot;Rabboni!&quot; (which means, Teacher). Jesus said
to her, &quot;Stop clinging to Me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father;
but go to My brethren and say to them, 'I ascend to My Father and your Father,
and My God and your God.'&quot;” (John 20:15-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“[Now after He had risen early on the first day of the week, He
first appeared to Mary Magdalene, from whom He had cast out seven demons. She
went and reported to those who had been with Him, while they were mourning and
weeping. When they heard that He was alive and had been seen by her, they
refused to believe it.” (Mark 16:9-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord appeared to five other women. Matt. 28:9-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And behold, Jesus met them and greeted them. And they came up
and took hold of His feet and worshiped Him. Then Jesus said to them, &quot;Do
not be afraid; go and take word to My brethren to leave for Galilee, and there
they will see Me.&quot;” (Matthew 28:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord appeared to Peter (Cephas) on a Sunday afternoon.
1 Cor. 15:5; Luke 24:33-35.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and that He appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.” (1
Corinthians 15:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And they got up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem, and
found gathered together the eleven and those who were with them, saying,
&quot;The Lord has really risen and has appeared to Simon.&quot; They began to
relate their experiences on the road and how He was recognized by them in the
breaking of the bread.” (Luke 24:33-35, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord appeared to two believers (Cleopas and Mary) on
the road to Emmaus. Luke 24:13-33; Mark 16:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And behold, two of them were going that very day to a village
named Emmaus, which was about seven miles from Jerusalem. And they were talking
with each other about all these things which had taken place. While they were
talking and discussing, Jesus Himself approached and began traveling with them.
But their eyes were prevented from recognizing Him. And He said to them,
&quot;What are these words that you are exchanging with one another as you are
walking?&quot; And they stood still, looking sad.” (Luke 24:13-17, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“After that, He appeared in a different form to two of them
while they were walking along on their way to the country.” (Mark 16:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord appeared to ten of His disciples (minus Thomas).
John 20:19-25.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So when it was evening on that day, the first day of the week,
and when the doors were shut where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews,
Jesus came and stood in their midst and said to them, &quot;Peace be with
you.&quot; And when He had said this, He showed them both His hands and His
side. The disciples then rejoiced when they saw the Lord.” (John 20:19-20,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord appeared to 11 of His disciples (with Thomas).
John 20:26-29; Mark 16:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“After eight days His disciples were again inside, and Thomas
with them. Jesus came, the doors having been shut, and stood in their midst and
said, &quot;Peace be with you.&quot; Then He said to Thomas, &quot;Reach here
with your finger, and see My hands; and reach here your hand and put it into My
side; and do not be unbelieving, but believing.&quot; Thomas answered and said
to Him, &quot;My Lord and my God!&quot; Jesus said to him, &quot;Because you
have seen Me, have you believed? Blessed are they who did not see, and yet
believed.&quot;” (John 20:26-29, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Afterward He appeared to the eleven themselves as they were
reclining at the table; and He reproached them for their unbelief and hardness
of heart, because they had not believed those who had seen Him after He had
risen.” (Mark 16:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord appeared to seven of His disciples by the Sea of
Galilee. John 21:1-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“After these things Jesus manifested Himself again to the
disciples at the Sea of Tiberias, and He manifested Himself in this way. Simon
Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the
sons of Zebedee, and two others of His disciples were together.” (John 21:1-2,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord appeared to more than 500 believers. 1 Cor. 15:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“After that He appeared to more than five hundred brethren at
one time, most of whom remain until now, but some have fallen asleep;” (1
Corinthians 15:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord appeared to Jesus’ half-brother James, who was
an unbeliever until our Lord’s resurrection. 1 Cor. 15:7; John 7:3; Acts 1:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“then He appeared to James, then to all the apostles;” (1
Corinthians 15:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore His brothers said to Him, &quot;Leave here and go
into Judea, so that Your disciples also may see Your works which You are
doing.” (John 7:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“These all with one mind were continually devoting themselves
to prayer, along with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His
brothers.” (Acts 1:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord appeared to His 11 disciples on a mountain near
Galilee when the Great Commission was given. Matt. 28:16-20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the eleven disciples proceeded to Galilee, to the mountain
which Jesus had designated. When they saw Him, they worshiped Him; but some
were doubtful. And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, &quot;All authority
has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. &quot;Go therefore and make
disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the
Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I commanded you; and
lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.&quot;” (Matthew 28:16-20,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord appeared to the disciples on Mt. Olivet (Mount
of Olives) during His ascension to the Third Heaven. Mark 16:19; Acts 1:3-11. </p>

<p class=Verses>“So then, when the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, He was
received up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God.” (Mark 16:19,
NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“To these He also presented Himself alive after His suffering,
by many convincing proofs, appearing to them over a period of forty days and
speaking of the things concerning the kingdom of God. Gathering them together,
He commanded them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for what the Father had
promised, &quot;Which,&quot; He said, &quot;you heard of from Me; for John
baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many
days from now.&quot;” (Acts 1:3-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So when they had come together, they were asking Him, saying,
&quot;Lord, is it at this time You are restoring the kingdom to Israel?&quot;
He said to them, &quot;It is not for you to know times or epochs which the
Father has fixed by His own authority; but you will receive power when the Holy
Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and
in all Judea and Samaria, and even to the remotest part of the earth.&quot; And
after He had said these things, He was lifted up while they were looking on, and
a cloud received Him out of their sight.” (Acts 1:6-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Post-Ascension Appearances</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord appeared to Stephen in Acts 7:55-56 just prior
to him being stoned to death.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But being full of the Holy Spirit, he gazed intently into
heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God;
and he said, &quot;Behold, I see the heavens opened up and the Son of Man
standing at the right hand of God.&quot;” (Acts 7:55-56, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord appeared to Paul (then Saul) on the road to
Damascus. Acts 9:l-8; 1 Cor. 15:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the
disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest, and asked for letters from him
to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any belonging to the Way,
both men and women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem. As he was
traveling, it happened that he was approaching Damascus, and suddenly a light
from heaven flashed around him; and he fell to the ground and heard a voice
saying to him, &quot;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?&quot; And he said,
&quot;Who are You, Lord?&quot; And He said, &quot;I am Jesus whom you are
persecuting, but get up and enter the city, and it will be told you what you
must do.&quot; The men who traveled with him stood speechless, hearing the
voice but seeing no one. Saul got up from the ground, and though his eyes were
open, he could see nothing; and leading him by the hand, they brought him into
Damascus.” (Acts 9:1-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and last of all, as to one untimely born, He appeared to me
also.” (1 Corinthians 15:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord appeared to Paul in Arabia. Gal. 1:12-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but I
received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ. For you have heard of my
former manner of life in Judaism, how I used to persecute the church of God
beyond measure and tried to destroy it; and I was advancing in Judaism beyond
many of my contemporaries among my countrymen, being more extremely zealous for
my ancestral traditions. But when God, who had set me apart even from my
mother's womb and called me through His grace, was pleased to reveal His Son in
me so that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult
with flesh and blood, nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles
before me; but I went away to Arabia, and returned once more to Damascus.”
(Galatians 1:12-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord appeared to Paul in the temple. Acts 22:17-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;It happened when I returned to Jerusalem and was praying
in the temple, that I fell into a trance, and I saw Him saying to me, 'Make
haste, and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your
testimony about Me.'” (Acts 22:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord appeared to Paul in a vision. Acts 18:9; Acts
23:10-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the Lord said to Paul in the night by a vision, &quot;Do
not be afraid any longer, but go on speaking and do not be silent;” (Acts 18:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And as a great dissension was developing, the commander was
afraid Paul would be torn to pieces by them and ordered the troops to go down
and take him away from them by force, and bring him into the barracks. But on
the night immediately following, the Lord stood at his side and said,
&quot;Take courage; for as you have solemnly witnessed to My cause at
Jerusalem, so you must witness at Rome also.&quot;” (Acts 23:10-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord appeared to John on the Isle of Patmos. Rev.
1:12-20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and in the middle of the lampstands I saw one like a son of
man, clothed in a robe reaching to the feet, and girded across His chest with a
golden sash.” (Revelation 1:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“When I saw Him, I fell at His feet like a dead man. And He
placed His right hand on me, saying, &quot;Do not be afraid; I am the first and
the last, and the living One; and I was dead, and behold, I am alive
forevermore, and I have the keys of death and of Hades.” (Revelation 1:17-18,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ ascended to heaven in June of 32 AD.</p>
