<h2><a name="_Jesus_Christ,_Our"></a>Jesus Christ, Our Mediator</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A mediator is one who acts as an intermediary agent in
bringing a settlement that is satisfactory to both parties who had been
previously in opposition to each other. The purpose of a mediator is to
interpose between parties in order to reconcile their differences. A mediator
must be equal with both parties. Phil. 2:6-8; John 1:14. </p>

<p class=Verses>“who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard
equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form
of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men. Being found in
appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of
death, even death on a cross.” (Philippians 2:6-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw His
glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.”
(John 1:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sin caused enmity, a wall, a barrier to exist between God
and man. Isaiah 59:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But your iniquities have made a separation between you and
your God, And your sins have hidden His face from you so that He does not
hear.” (Isaiah 59:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A mediator was necessary to establish fellowship between
God and man. Job 9:2; Job 9:32-33.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;In truth I know that this is so; But how can a man be in
the right before God?” (Job 9:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For He is not a man as I am that I may answer Him, That
we may go to court together. &quot;There is no umpire between us, Who may lay
his hand upon us both.” (Job 9:32-33, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Necessity For a Mediator</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Adam and Eve were in sinless innocence and were in
perfect environment in the Garden and in fellowship with God. Jesus Christ
walked and talked daily with Adam and Eve. Sin due to their negative volition
created a separation from God. Gen. 2:15-17; Gen. 2:22-23; Gen. 3:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD God took the man and put him into the garden of
Eden to cultivate it and keep it. The LORD God commanded the man, saying,
&quot;From any tree of the garden you may eat freely; but from the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat from
it you will surely die.&quot;” (Genesis 2:15-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD God fashioned into a woman the rib which He had taken
from the man, and brought her to the man. The man said, &quot;This is now bone
of my bones, And flesh of my flesh; She shall be called Woman, Because she was
taken out of Man.&quot;” (Genesis 2:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that
it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one wise,
she took from its fruit and ate; and she gave also to her husband with her, and
he ate.” (Genesis 3:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They lost fellowship with God when they sinned and died
spiritually. They did not need to hide, but did anyway. Gen. 3:7-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that
they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loin
coverings. They heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in the
cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of
the LORD God among the trees of the garden. Then the LORD God called to the
man, and said to him, “Where are you?” He said, “I heard the sound of You in
the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid myself.”“  (Genesis
3:7-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first act of legalism was sewing fig leaves together.
Man tried to help himself. The first act of grace was God coming to them. Gen.
3:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“They heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in
the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence
of the LORD God among the trees of the garden.” (Genesis 3:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Adam was created in the “image of God.” His children were
in his own likeness after his image. Gen. 1:26; Gen. 5:1; Gen. 5:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then God said, &quot;Let Us make man in Our image, according
to Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds
of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth, and over every creeping
thing that creeps on the earth.&quot;” (Genesis 1:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day when
God created man, He made him in the likeness of God.” (Genesis 5:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“When Adam had lived one hundred and thirty years, he became
the father of a son in his own likeness, according to his image, and named him
Seth.” (Genesis 5:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The entire human race is “in Adam.” 1 Cor. 15:22.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made
alive.” (1 Corinthians 15:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Adam’s original sin is imputed at physical birth to our
genetically-formed old sin nature. We are all born spiritually dead. This puts
the human race behind the barrier between God and man that was sin formed when
Adam and Eve sinned. Rom. 3:23. </p>

<p class=Verses>“for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,”
(Romans 3:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Man could come to God only if someone would stand in the
middle that was qualified as a mediator. That mediator had to be equally man
and equally God to be qualified. Man is completely helpless to help himself.
John 1:12. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to
become children of God, even to those who believe in His name,” (John 1:12,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Therefore, it was necessary to have a mediator. God
decided in eternity past send a mediator – Jesus Christ. Job 9:2; 1 Peter 1:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;In truth I know that this is so; But how can a man be in
the right before God?” (Job 9:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For He was foreknown before the foundation of the world, but
has appeared in these last times for the sake of you” (1 Peter 1:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Job recognized that there is a gap between man and God.
Job 9:32-33.</p>

<p class=Verses>““For He is not a man as I am that I may answer Him, That we
may go to court together. “There is no umpire between us, Who may lay his hand
upon us both.”  (Job 9:32-33, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 3:15 is the first promise of salvation. This
is called the “proto-evangel” or first Gospel message given to man.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And I will put enmity Between you and the woman, And between
your seed and her seed; He shall bruise you on the head, And you shall bruise
him on the heel.&quot;” (Genesis 3:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Mediator’s Qualifications and Provision</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To satisfy God, the mediator had to be equal to God and
be without sin. To help man, the mediator had to be true humanity because He
must take man’s place as a substitute and die spiritually by paying for the
sins of all mankind. God provided the Mediator – the Lord Jesus Christ. Gal.
4:4-5; 1 Tim. 2:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His
Son, born of a woman, born under the Law, so that He might redeem those who
were under the Law, that we might receive the adoption as sons.” (Galatians
4:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For there is one God, and one mediator also between God and
men, the man Christ Jesus,” (1 Timothy 2:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Therefore, Jesus Christ in Hypostatic Union was qualified
to propitiate or satisfy both the perfect righteousness and justice of God the
Father and reconcile man to God. 1 John 2:2; Col. 1:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins; and not for
ours only, but also for those of the whole world.” (1 John 2:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And although you were formerly alienated and hostile in mind,
engaged in evil deeds,” (Colossians 1:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are two areas requiring a mediator. At salvation,
He removes the barrier between God and man. This is called reconciliation. Eph.
2:14-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For He Himself is our peace, who made both groups into one and
broke down the barrier of the dividing wall, by abolishing in His flesh the
enmity, which is the Law of commandments contained in ordinances, so that in
Himself He might make the two into one new man, thus establishing peace, and
might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, by it having
put to death the enmity. AND HE CAME AND PREACHED PEACE TO YOU WHO WERE FAR
AWAY, AND PEACE TO THOSE WHO WERE NEAR; for through Him we both have our access
in one Spirit to the Father.” (Ephesians 2:14-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Mediator’s Work</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ did not become Mediator until after His
death, resurrection, ascension, and session seated at the right hand of the
Father - alive in His humanity, eternal in His deity. Jesus Christ set up His
will and testament in eternity past before man was created - before Adam
existed. The will (testament) is not valid until death. However, the will is
made retroactive upon all who believed in the Old Testament. The statement of
mediatorship is found in Hebrews 9:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason He is the mediator of a new covenant, so that,
since a death has taken place for the redemption of the transgressions that
were committed under the first covenant, those who have been called may receive
the promise of the eternal inheritance.” (Hebrews 9:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A covenant is a disposition made by one party in favor of
another on specified terms which must be acceded to. A permanent covenant must
have both a testator who must die and a mediator who must live. The basis of
the New Covenant is a testator who dies and yet lives, and a mediator who is
equal with God and equal with man, the God-man Jesus Christ. Heb. 9:16-17; Acts
16:31.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For where a covenant is, there must of necessity be the death
of the one who made it. For a covenant is valid only when men are dead, for it
is never in force while the one who made it lives.” (Hebrews 9:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“They said, &quot;Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be
saved, you and your household.&quot;” (Acts 16:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first covenant was the Mosaic Law which was
temporary. It was renewed year by year. God could pick up the option each year
on the Day of Atonement. Jesus Christ died to validate the New Covenant. All
the shadows of the Old Covenant (which told that Jesus Christ would die) also
told them (Old Testament believers) that they would be included when He did
die. Acts 7:53.</p>

<p class=Verses>“you who received the law as ordained by angels, and yet did
not keep it.&quot;” (Acts 7:53, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The New Covenant is permanent, eternal and sets aside the
old covenant. Jesus Christ fulfilled the Mosaic Law. Rom. 10:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone
who believes.” (Romans 10:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Old Testament believers were saved by believing in the
Messiah to come, Jesus Christ who had not died yet, but in the mind of God it had
already occurred. 1 Peter 1:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For He was foreknown before the foundation of the world, but
has appeared in these last times for the sake of you” (1 Peter 1:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Mosaic Law could not provide salvation because it had
no provision for an efficacious sacrifice. Animals could not act as mediators -
no resurrection. The Mosaic Law was sanctified, ordained, authorized and
started on the basis of animal sacrifices. Animal sacrifices, under the Law,
were shadows, not the reality. Heb. 9:19-22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the
people according to the Law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats,
with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and
all the people, saying, &quot;THIS IS THE BLOOD OF THE COVENANT WHICH GOD
COMMANDED YOU.&quot; And in the same way he sprinkled both the tabernacle and
all the vessels of the ministry with the blood. And according to the Law, one
may almost say, all things are cleansed with blood, and without shedding of
blood there is no forgiveness.” (Hebrews 9:19-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Where once stood the barrier, now stands Jesus Christ,
the only Mediator, the only way and only access to God. John 14:6. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Jesus said to him, &quot;I am the way, and the truth, and the
life; no one comes to the Father but through Me.” (John 14:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Peter 2:24, “healed” man and God have been brought
together.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, so that
we might die to sin and live to righteousness; for by His wounds you were
healed.” (1 Peter 2:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The work of the mediator is Jesus Christ functioning as
our Intercessor. He is also our Advocate with the Father. In the spiritual
life, Jesus Christ is the believer’s defense attorney when Satan accuses the
believer. Heb. 7:25; 1 John 2:1; 1 Tim. 2:5-6. See category on <a
href="#_Advocacy_of_Jesus">Advocacy of Jesus Christ</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore He is able also to save forever those who draw near
to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them.”
(Hebrews 7:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“My little children, I am writing these things to you so that
you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus
Christ the righteous;” (1 John 2:1, NASB)     </p>

<p class=Verses>“For there is one God, and one mediator also between God and
men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave Himself as a ransom for all, the testimony
given at the proper time.” (1 Timothy 2:5-6, NASB)</p>
