<h2>Jesus Christ, Sustained on the Cross</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>During the first three hours on the Cross, the humanity
of our Lord was sustained by God the Holy Spirit and God the Father. John 3:34;
Isaiah 50:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for He
gives the Spirit without measure.” (John 3:34, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the Lord GOD helps Me, Therefore, I am not disgraced;
Therefore, I have set My face like flint, And I know that I will not be
ashamed.” (Isaiah 50:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>During the last three hours on
the Cross, the humanity of our Lord was sustained only by the enabling power of
God the Holy Spirit. Jesus Christ applied the whole realm of Bible doctrine He
had learned - the Word of God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Isaiah 50:4-8, our Lord’s humanity learned Bible doctrine
from God the Father. Jesus’ positive volition was tested before the Cross. “For
the Lord God helps Me” refers to God the Father helping Jesus Christ to stay
alive during the first three hours on the Cross. In doing so, our Lord was able
to bear up under maximum pressure without giving way.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The Lord GOD has given Me the tongue of disciples, That I may
know how to sustain the weary one with a word. He awakens Me morning by
morning, He awakens My ear to listen as a disciple. The Lord GOD has opened My
ear; And I was not disobedient Nor did I turn back. I gave My back to those who
strike Me, And My cheeks to those who pluck out the beard; I did not cover My
face from humiliation and spitting. For the Lord GOD helps Me, Therefore, I am
not disgraced; Therefore, I have set My face like flint, And I know that I will
not be ashamed. He who vindicates Me is near; Who will contend with Me? Let us
stand up to each other; Who has a case against Me? Let him draw near to Me.”
(Isaiah 50:4-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Isaiah 42:3, “A bruised reed” is a reed being crushed
and is a reference to the humanity of Jesus Christ bearing our sins. “He will
not break” is a reference to His enduring without sinning the substitutionary
spiritual death as judgment for the sins of mankind. He did not break under
this tremendous burden. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;A bruised reed He will not break And a dimly burning
wick He will not extinguish; He will faithfully bring forth justice.” (Isaiah
42:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“He will not extinguish” means that while He bore our
sins, He was a “dimly burning wick” when He died spiritually. “He will
faithfully bring forth justice” means He faithfully caused justice to be
administered so that sins no longer stand between man and God. They were judged
at the Cross.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Isaiah 50:7, “l have set my face like flint” expresses
the positive volition of the humanity of Jesus Christ as He faced the Cross. As
deity, He couldn’t die. As humanity, He had to use His volition. The whole plan
of God would have been ruined if the volition of the humanity our Lord had been
negative even once. “And I know” means that He knew from the doctrine that He
had in His soul and the sustaining power of God the Holy Spirit, He would make
it through the six hours of the Cross. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For the Lord GOD helps Me, Therefore, I am not disgraced;
Therefore, I have set My face like flint, And I know that I will not be
ashamed.” (Isaiah 50:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“I will not be ashamed” means He would carry through and
accomplish the mission of bearing the sins of the whole world. His friends
couldn’t help Him. John 10:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;No one has taken it away from Me, but I lay it down on
My own initiative. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to
take it up again. This commandment I received from My Father.&quot;” (John
10:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Isaiah 49:2, “He has also made Me a select arrow”
refers to arrows that are the truest and will go straight to the target. </p>

<p class=Verses>“He has made My mouth like a sharp sword, In the shadow of His
hand He has concealed Me; And He has also made Me a select arrow, He has hidden
Me in His quiver.” (Isaiah 49:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Isaiah 50:8, “He is near” means God the Father is near
to judge. God the Father judged the sins He had just imputed to the body of the
humanity of Jesus Christ. He was satisfied with the what the our Lord did on
the Cross. The person of Jesus Christ satisfied His righteousness. The work of
Jesus Christ satisfied His justice.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He who vindicates Me is near; Who will contend with Me? Let us
stand up to each other; Who has a case against Me? Let him draw near to Me.”
(Isaiah 50:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalm 138:2, “You have magnified Your word according
to all Your name” means that on the Cross, while being sustained by the filling
of the Holy Spirit, the humanity of Jesus Christ was able to apply all of the
Bible doctrine in His soul under the greatest testing of all human history. He
did not sin once while being judged for our sins. He remained absolutely
sinless. God the Father abandoned the humanity of Christ and for the first
time, broke fellowship with Him to allow the judgment of bearing the penalty of
our sins. Psalms 22:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I will bow down toward Your holy temple And give thanks to
Your name for Your lovingkindness and Your truth; For You have magnified Your
word according to all Your name.” (Psalms 138:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the choir director; upon Aijeleth Hashshahar. A Psalm of
David. My God, my God, why have You forsaken me? Far from my deliverance are
the words of my groaning.” (Psalms 22:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer today has the exact same sustaining ministry
of the Holy Spirit, plus the indwelling of Jesus Christ, plus the indwelling of
God the Father. These are the Church Age believer’s grace resources provided by
God. Learn all about them from the Word of God. Use them.</p>
