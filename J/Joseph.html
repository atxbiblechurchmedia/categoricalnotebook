<h2>Joseph</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Outline of Joseph’s Life</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jacob’s father, Israel, loved Joseph more than his other
sons. This was initially bad for Joseph, but God ultimately worked things for
good according to God's perfect plan. Joseph’s brothers hated him due to their
father’s favoritism toward Joseph. Gen. 37:3-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons, because he was
the son of his old age; and he made him a varicolored tunic. His brothers saw
that their father loved him more than all his brothers; and so they hated him
and could not speak to him on friendly terms.” (Genesis 37:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Joseph’s brothers plotted to kill him. Reuben intervened
to prevent the murder. Gen. 37:18; Gen. 37:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“When they saw him from a distance and before he came close to
them, they plotted against him to put him to death.” (Genesis 37:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Reuben further said to them, &quot;Shed no blood. Throw him
into this pit that is in the wilderness, but do not lay hands on him&quot;—that
he might rescue him out of their hands, to restore him to his father.” (Genesis
37:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Joseph’s brothers saw a caravan on its way to Egypt. Judah
suggesting selling Joseph to the Ishmaelites and Midianites in the caravan.
Gen. 37:25-28.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then they sat down to eat a meal. And as they raised their
eyes and looked, behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead, with
their camels bearing aromatic gum and balm and myrrh, on their way to bring
them down to Egypt. Judah said to his brothers, &quot;What profit is it for us
to kill our brother and cover up his blood? &quot;Come and let us sell him to
the Ishmaelites and not lay our hands on him, for he is our brother, our own
flesh.&quot; And his brothers listened to him. Then some Midianite traders passed
by, so they pulled him up and lifted Joseph out of the pit, and sold him to the
Ishmaelites for twenty shekels of silver. Thus they brought Joseph into Egypt.”
(Genesis 37:25-28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Joseph arrived in Egypt as a slave. Joseph was sold into
the house of Potiphar. It was bad that it was slavery, but good that it was
Potiphar. Gen. 39:1; Gen. 37:36.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an
Egyptian officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the bodyguard, bought him from the
Ishmaelites, who had taken him down there.” (Genesis 39:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Meanwhile, the Midianites sold him in Egypt to Potiphar,
Pharaoh's officer, the captain of the bodyguard.” (Genesis 37:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Potiphar’s wife lied, which caused Joseph’s imprisonment.
Later, Joseph was placed in charge of the prisoners in the prison. Gen.
39:17-18; Gen. 39:22. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then she spoke to him with these words, &quot;The Hebrew
slave, whom you brought to us, came in to me to make sport of me; and as I
raised my voice and screamed, he left his garment beside me and fled
outside.&quot;” (Genesis 39:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The chief jailer committed to Joseph's charge all the
prisoners who were in the jail; so that whatever was done there, he was
responsible for it.” (Genesis 39:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Joseph had trusted in man to get him out of prison
instead of trusting in God. Magicians and wise men were not able to interpret
Pharaoh’s dream. Pharaoh had heard that Joseph could interpret dreams, so
called for him from prison. This was part of God's plan for Joseph, but he
didn’t realize it at the time. God worked this situation together for good to
the benefit of Joseph and for God's plan. Gen. 40:14; Gen. 41:8; Gen. 41:15-16;
Gen. 41:39-40.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Only keep me in mind when it goes well with you, and
please do me a kindness by mentioning me to Pharaoh and get me out of this
house.” (Genesis 40:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now in the morning his spirit was troubled, so he sent and
called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all its wise men. And Pharaoh told
them his dreams, but there was no one who could interpret them to Pharaoh.”
(Genesis 41:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Pharaoh said to Joseph, &quot;I have had a dream, but no one
can interpret it; and I have heard it said about you, that when you hear a
dream you can interpret it.&quot; Joseph then answered Pharaoh, saying,
&quot;It is not in me; God will give Pharaoh a favorable answer.&quot;”
(Genesis 41:15-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So Pharaoh said to Joseph, &quot;Since God has informed you of
all this, there is no one so discerning and wise as you are. &quot;You shall be
over my house, and according to your command all my people shall do homage;
only in the throne I will be greater than you.&quot;” (Genesis 41:39-40, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s grace turns cursing into blessing. God, in His omniscience,
works all things (bad and good) together for the good of those who belong to
Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Bones of Joseph</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When Joseph died, he was embalmed and his coffin remained
in Egypt. He was not buried while they were in Egypt. Gen. 50:22-26.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now Joseph stayed in Egypt, he and his father’s household, and
Joseph lived one hundred and ten years. Joseph saw the third generation of
Ephraim’s sons; also the sons of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were born on
Joseph’s knees. Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die, but God will
surely take care of you and bring you up from this land to the land which He
promised on oath to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob.” Then Joseph made the sons
of Israel swear, saying, “God will surely take care of you, and you shall carry
my bones up from here.” So Joseph died at the age of one hundred and ten years;
and he was embalmed and placed in a coffin in Egypt.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis
50:22-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Joseph was the number two man in the Empire – the Prime
Minister. For 400 years, the Jews would go to Joseph’s sarcophagus and learn
prophecy and doctrine. Gen. 15:13-16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“God said to Abram, “Know for certain that your descendants
will be strangers in a land that is not theirs, where they will be enslaved and
oppressed four hundred years. “But I will also judge the nation whom they will
serve, and afterward they will come out with many possessions. “As for you, you
shall go to your fathers in peace; you will be buried at a good old age. “Then
in the fourth generation they will return here, for the iniquity of the Amorite
is not yet complete.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis 15:13-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In slavery, they had children and they had family life.
In Bible doctrine, they had inward peace. The bones of Joseph functioned as the
Bible long before the Bible was written – the Gospel was clearly declared. The
Exodus generation that left Egypt was saved in that they partook of the
Passover. They were a mixed multitude: Jew, Gentile, Ethiopian, etc. A
regenerated generation walked out of Egypt - 2 million people, perhaps 900,000
were adults. Moses took the bones of Joseph with him. In Exodus 13:19, “solemnly
swear” means he extracted a promise from the children of Israel.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for he had made the
sons of Israel solemnly swear, saying, “God will surely take care of you, and
you shall carry my bones from here with you.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Exodus 13:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Joshua buried the bones of Joseph in Shechem which is the
word for shoulder power. God’s Word is always powerful. Joshua 24:32.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now they buried the bones of Joseph, which the sons of Israel
brought up from Egypt, at Shechem, in the piece of ground which Jacob had
bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for one hundred pieces of
money; and they became the inheritance of Joseph’s sons.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Joshua
24:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He was buried in his own land near his ancestors. In
resurrection, all will rise from the place in which they were buried. The
principle of resurrection is pictured in the bones of Joseph. Joseph had his
eyes on the Lord and he believed in the resurrection. The bones of Joseph tell
us that the Word of God is the only answer. The concept of the bones of Joseph
is a memorial to the fact that God keeps His word. Heb. 11:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“By faith Joseph, when he was dying, made mention of the exodus
of the sons of Israel, and gave orders concerning his bones.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews
11:22, NASB)</p>
