<h2>Jesus Christ’s Deity</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Witnesses to His Deity </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Holy Spirit. John 5:31-32.</p>

<p class=Verses>““If I alone testify about Myself, My testimony is not true. “There
is another who testifies of Me, and I know that the testimony which He gives
about Me is true.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 5:31-32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>John the Baptist. John 5:33-35. </p>

<p class=Verses>““You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth. “But
the testimony which I receive is not from man, but I say these things so that
you may be saved. “He was the lamp that was burning and was shining and you
were willing to rejoice for a while in his light.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 5:33-35,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>His works. John 5:36.</p>

<p class=Verses>““But the testimony which I have is greater than the testimony
of John; for the works which the Father has given Me to accomplish—the very
works that I do—testify about Me, that the Father has sent Me.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John
5:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Father. John 5:37-38.</p>

<p class=Verses>““And the Father who sent Me, He has testified of Me. You have

5:37-38, NASB)</p>

Messiah, Jesus Christ. John 5:39-44.</p>

<p class=Verses>““You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you
have eternal life; it is these that testify about Me; and you are unwilling to
come to Me so that you may have life. “I do not receive glory from men; but I
know you, that you do not have the love of God in yourselves. “I have come in
My Father’s name, and you do not receive Me; if another comes in his own name,
you will receive him. “How can you believe, when you receive glory from one
another and you do not seek the glory that is from the one and only God?”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John
5:39-44, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Moses. His writings in the Pentateuch. John 5:45-47.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father; the
one who accuses you is Moses, in whom you have set your hope. “For if you
believed Moses, you would believe Me, for he wrote about Me. “But if you do not
believe his writings, how will you believe My words?”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(John
5:45-47, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Jesus went out, along with His disciples, to the villages of
Caesarea Philippi; and on the way He questioned His disciples, saying to them, “Who
do people say that I am?” They told Him, saying, “John the Baptist; and others
say Elijah; but others, one of the prophets.” And He continued by questioning
them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter answered and said to Him, “You are
the Christ.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Mark 8:27-29, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“They answered and said, “John the Baptist, and others say
Elijah; but others, that one of the prophets of old has risen again.” And He
said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” And Peter answered and said, “The
Christ of God.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Luke 9:19-20, NASB)</p>

words of eternal life. “We have believed and have come to know that You are the

believes in Me will live even if he dies, and everyone who lives and believes
in Me will never die. Do you believe this?” She *said to Him, “Yes, Lord; I
have believed that You are the Christ, the Son of God, even He who comes into
the world.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 11:25-27, NASB)</p>

John 8:57-58.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The Jews answered Him, “For a good work we do not stone You,
but for blasphemy; and because You, being a man, make Yourself out to be God.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(John
10:33, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So the Jews said to Him, “You are not yet fifty years old, and
have You seen Abraham?” Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, before
Abraham was born, I am.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 8:57-58, NASB)</p>

AT THE RIGHT HAND OF POWER, and COMING WITH THE CLOUDS OF HEAVEN.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Mark
