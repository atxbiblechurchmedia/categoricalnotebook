<h2>Jesus Christ’s Burial</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The burial of Christ indicates that it was the humanity
of Christ that bore our sins, which was the reason He had to become true
humanity. Jesus Christ died with gangsters on each side of Him. Isaiah 53:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“His grave was assigned with wicked men, Yet He was with a rich
man in His death, Because He had done no violence, Nor was there any deceit in
His mouth.”  (Isaiah 53:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The penalty for anyone indicted for blasphemy (as Jesus
was unjustly) under Jewish law was death by stoning. The penalty for a capital
crime under Roman law was crucifixion as well as an obscure burial where
criminals were usually buried. Even though the Pharisees accused our Lord of
blasphemy, He was brought to the Cross unjustly under Roman law even though
never convicted of any crime. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord’s tomb had to be in a prominent place because if
His resurrection was going to be properly documented and verified, the tomb had
to be well known. His friend, Joseph of Arimathea, buried Christ’s body in his
own tomb. The Pharisee Nicodemus helped Joseph. Matt. 27:57-61; John 19:39-41.</p>

<p class=Verses>“When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea,
named Joseph, who himself had also become a disciple of Jesus. This man went to
Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to
him. And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and laid
it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock; and he rolled a
large stone against the entrance of the tomb and went away. And Mary Magdalene
was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the grave.”  (Matthew 27:57-61,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Nicodemus, who had first come to Him by night, also came,
bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds weight. So they
took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen wrappings with the spices, as is
the burial custom of the Jews. Now in the place where He was crucified there
was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid.” 
(John 19:39-41, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers grieved and didn’t seem to remember that He had
told them that He must die, be buried, and rise again. Peter didn’t even
remember when he argued with Jesus about this event. Mark 16:10; Matt. 17:22-23;
Matt. 16:21-22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“She went and reported to those who had been with Him, while
they were mourning and weeping.”  (Mark 16:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And while they were gathering together in Galilee, Jesus said
to them, “The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men; and
they will kill Him, and He will be raised on the third day.” And they were
deeply grieved.”  (Matthew 17:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“From that time Jesus began to show His disciples that He must
go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and
scribes, and be killed, and be raised up on the third day. Peter took Him aside
and began to rebuke Him, saying, “God forbid it, Lord! This shall never happen
to You.”“  (Matthew 16:21-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>His enemies had taunted Him. He had shown them many signs,
but they had not believed. He knew (omniscience) that they would not believe,
but He gave one more sign. Matt. 12:38; Matt. 12:39-40.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to Him,
&quot;Teacher, we want to see a sign from You.&quot;” (Matthew 12:38, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“But He answered and said to them, “An evil and adulterous
generation craves for a sign; and yet no sign will be given to it but the sign
of Jonah the prophet; for just as JONAH WAS THREE DAYS AND THREE NIGHTS IN THE
BELLY OF THE SEA MONSTER, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights
in the heart of the earth.”  (Matthew 12:39-40, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord’s enemies worried that the tomb may not be
sealed securely and that the disciples would steal away His body, so they set a
seal and a watch upon it. Matt. 27:62-66.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now on the next day, the day after the preparation, the chief
priests and the Pharisees gathered together with Pilate, and said, “Sir, we
remember that when He was still alive that deceiver said, ‘After three days I
am to rise again.’ “Therefore, give orders for the grave to be made secure
until the third day, otherwise His disciples may come and steal Him away and
say to the people, ‘He has risen from the dead,’ and the last deception will be
worse than the first.” Pilate said to them, “You have a guard; go, make it as
secure as you know how.” And they went and made the grave secure, and along
with the guard they set a seal on the stone.”  (Matthew 27:62-66, NASB)</p>
