<h2><a name="_D-Judas_Iscariot"></a><a name="_Judas_Iscariot"></a>Judas
Iscariot </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Opportunities for Judas to believe</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Judas was called as one of the 12 disciples to Jesus
Christ. John 6:70-71; Luke 6:16; Matt. 10:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Jesus answered them, &quot;Did I Myself not choose you, the
twelve, and yet one of you is a devil?&quot; Now He meant Judas the son of
Simon Iscariot, for he, one of the twelve, was going to betray Him.” (John
6:70-71, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And when day came, He called His disciples to Him and chose
twelve of them, whom He also named as apostles: Simon, whom He also named
Peter, and Andrew his brother; and James and John; and Philip and Bartholomew;
and Matthew and Thomas; James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon who was called the
Zealot; Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.”
(Luke 6:13-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Judas attended the Last Supper with our Lord. John 13:26.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Jesus then answered, &quot;That is the one for whom I shall
dip the morsel and give it to him.&quot; So when He had dipped the morsel, He
took and gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.” (John 13:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Sowing of Judas</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Judas was named the treasurer of the travelling group
that included the 12 disciplines plus our Lord. Judas was covetous and was a
thief. He stole money from the money box used by the travelling group. John
12:4-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But Judas Iscariot, one of His disciples, who was intending to
betray Him, said, &quot;Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii
and given to poor people?&quot; Now he said this, not because he was concerned
about the poor, but because he was a thief, and as he had the money box, he
used to pilfer what was put into it.” (John 12:4-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Judas was Satan-possessed. John 13:27; Luke 22:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“After the morsel, Satan then entered into him. Therefore Jesus
said to him, &quot;What you do, do quickly.&quot;” (John 13:27, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“And Satan entered into Judas who was called Iscariot,
belonging to the number of the twelve.” (Luke 22:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Judas went to the chief priests to make a betrayal
bargain. Mark 14:10; Matt. 26:14-16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went off to
the chief priests in order to betray Him to them.” (Mark 14:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then one of the twelve, named Judas Iscariot, went to the
chief priests and said, &quot;What are you willing to give me to betray Him to
you?&quot; And they weighed out thirty pieces of silver to him. From then on he
began looking for a good opportunity to betray Jesus.” (Matthew 26:14-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Reaping of Judas</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Judas regretted betraying our Lord. The Greek word is <span
lang=EL>μεταμε</span>́<span lang=EL>λλομαι</span> (metamellomai) and means
regret remorse, restitution. Matt. 27:3-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then when Judas, who had betrayed Him, saw that He had been
condemned, he felt remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the
chief priests and elders, saying, &quot;I have sinned by betraying innocent
blood.&quot; But they said, &quot;What is that to us? See to that
yourself!&quot;” (Matthew 27:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Judas regretted betraying Jesus and killed himself. The
chief priests took his money and bought the Field of Blood. Matt. 27:5; Acts
1:18-19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And he threw the pieces of silver into the temple sanctuary
and departed; and he went away and hanged himself.” (Matthew 27:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“(Now this man acquired a field with the price of his
wickedness, and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his
intestines gushed out. And it became known to all who were living in Jerusalem;
so that in their own language that field was called Hakeldama, that is, Field
of Blood.)” (Acts 1:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Judas was replaced by Paul as one of the 12 disciples. 1
Cor. 15:7-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“then He appeared to James, then to all the apostles; and last
of all, as to one untimely born, He appeared to me also. For I am the least of
the apostles, and not fit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the
church of God. But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me
did not prove vain; but I labored even more than all of them, yet not I, but
the grace of God with me.” (1 Corinthians 15:7-10, NASB)</p>
