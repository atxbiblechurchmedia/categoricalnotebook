<h2>Jesus Christ’s Childhood</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>His Humanity’s Education </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ in His humanity had to learn Bible doctrine
just as any other human being. He spoke as a member of the human race and His
human brain had to learn just as our human brain has to learn. His human spirit
was taught by the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Isaiah 50:4, the reason He learned Bible doctrine was
that “the Lord God” (God the Father) had given Him divine protection and “the
tongue of disciples” or a doctrinal message obtained by consistent study. Jesus
Christ studied. You have to study to have a message. “That I may know how to
sustain the weary one with a word” means He learned to help the weary ones with
words, with Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The Lord GOD has given Me the tongue of disciples, That I may
know how to sustain the weary one with a word. He awakens Me morning by
morning, He awakens My ear to listen as a disciple.”  (Isaiah 50:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“He awakens My ear” means our Lord learned Bible doctrine
every day. The hiphil stem in the Hebrew is causative. Every day Jesus Christ
awoke to study Bible doctrine using the exact same system of perception that
Church Age believers use – the grace apparatus for perception. “To listen as a
disciple” means His purpose was to listen to the Word with the result that He
learned. His purpose in getting up in the morning was to learn.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The Lord GOD has opened My ear; And I was not disobedient Nor
did I turn back.”  (Isaiah 50:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Isaiah 50:5, God the Father taught Him Bible doctrine.
“The Lord God” is God the Father, the author of grace “has opened My ear” which
is an idiom meaning to give instruction. In His humanity, Jesus Christ knew why
He was here, what His mission was, and that He was going to the Cross. He
understood it all from the Bible doctrine He had learned.  “I was not
disobedient” was the response of Jesus Christ to God the Father’s plan. “Nor
did I turn back” means Had positive volition regarding God’s plan. In Isaiah
50:6, our Lord’s positive volition was tested before the Cross.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I gave My back to those who strike Me, And My cheeks to those
who pluck out the beard; I did not cover My face from humiliation and spitting.” 
(Isaiah 50:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As a result of His learning doctrine, His humanity
increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and men. Luke 2:52.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And Jesus kept increasing in wisdom and stature, and in favor
with God and men.”  (Luke 2:52, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>His Humanity’s Maturity </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ came into the world as an infant and grew up
as a normal child. Luke 2:12; Matt. 1:25; Isaiah 53:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>““This will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in
cloths and lying in a manger.”“  (Luke 2:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“but kept her a virgin until she gave birth to a Son; and he
called His name Jesus.”  (Matthew 1:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For He grew up before Him like a tender shoot, And like a root
out of parched ground; He has no stately form or majesty That we should look
upon Him, Nor appearance that we should be attracted to Him.”  (Isaiah 53:2,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In growing up as a normal child, the humanity of Jesus
Christ like a tender plant needed protection. Our Lord’s humanity needed
protection so that He could get to the Cross. Jesus Christ didn’t appear as a king.
He had times when He was hungry and thirsty just like any other human being.
Matt. 4:2; Matt. 21:18; John 4:7; John 19:28.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And after He had fasted forty days and forty nights, He then
became hungry.”  (Matthew 4:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now in the morning, when He was returning to the city, He
became hungry.”  (Matthew 21:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“After this, Jesus, knowing that all things had already been
accomplished, to fulfill the Scripture, said, “I am thirsty.”“  (John 19:28,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The humanity of Jesus Christ got tired and slept. John
4:6; Matt. 8:24; Mark 4:38.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and Jacob’s well was there. So Jesus, being wearied from His
journey, was sitting thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour.”  (John
4:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And behold, there arose a great storm on the sea, so that the
boat was being covered with the waves; but Jesus Himself was asleep.”  (Matthew
8:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Jesus Himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion; and
they woke Him and said to Him, “Teacher, do You not care that we are perishing?”“ 
(Mark 4:38, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When Jesus Christ spoke, He spoke from one of three
sources. The first source was from His deity as in  Hebrews 10:5. The second
source was from His humanity as in John 19:28. The third source was from His
Hypostatic Union as in John 14:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, when He comes into the world, He says, “SACRIFICE
AND OFFERING YOU HAVE NOT DESIRED, BUT A BODY YOU HAVE PREPARED FOR ME;” 
(Hebrews 10:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“After this, Jesus, knowing that all things had already been
accomplished, to fulfill the Scripture, said, “I am thirsty.”“  (John 19:28,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life;
no one comes to the Father but through Me.”  (John 14:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As a youth (about 12 years old) He went to the temple. He
began His public ministry at about 30 years of age. Luke 2:46-47; Luke 3:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then, after three days they found Him in the temple, sitting
in the midst of the teachers, both listening to them and asking them questions.
And all who heard Him were amazed at His understanding and His answers.”  (Luke
2:46-47, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“When He began His ministry, Jesus Himself was about thirty
years of age, being, as was supposed, the son of Joseph, the son of Eli,” 
(Luke 3:23, NASB)</p>
