<h2><a name="_D-Jesus_Christ,_Earthly"></a>Jesus Christ, Earthly Ministry</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Son came to earth to serve and to minister. To do
that, He took on the form of a bond-servant. Phil. 2:7; Luke 22:27; Matt.
20:28.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and
being made in the likeness of men.”  (Philippians 2:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““For who is greater, the one who reclines at the table or the
one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines at the table? But I am among you
as the one who serves.”  (Luke 22:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to
serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.”“  (Matthew 20:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ’s work in summarized in John 21:25.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And there are also many other things which Jesus did, which if
they were written in detail, I suppose that even the world itself would not
contain the books that would be written.”  (John 21:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord’s virgin birth was planned in eternity past. He
matured as a normal human being. Psalms 3:7; Isaiah 53:2. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God! For You have smitten all my
enemies on the cheek; You have shattered the teeth of the wicked.” (Psalms 3:7,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For He grew up before Him like a tender shoot, And like a root
out of parched ground; He has no stately form or majesty That we should look
upon Him, Nor appearance that we should be attracted to Him.” (Isaiah 53:2,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>His humanity was educated in Bible doctrine via the first
use of the grace apparatus for perception. Isaiah 50:4-5. </p>

<p class=Verses>“The Lord GOD has given Me the tongue of disciples, That I may
know how to sustain the weary one with a word. He awakens Me morning by
morning, He awakens My ear to listen as a disciple. The Lord GOD has opened My
ear; And I was not disobedient Nor did I turn back.” (Isaiah 50:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Holy Spirit sustained the humanity of Jesus
Christ during His time on earth. The Holy spirit was given to Him without
measure. John 3:34.</p>

<p class=Verses>““For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for He
gives the Spirit without measure.”  (John 3:34, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He was baptized by John the Baptist in a unique baptism
signifying that He had come to do the Father’s will. He was identified with
water, the water signifying the will of the Father in salvation - the Cross.
The Kingdom of God here is in the form of the King, Jesus Christ. Matt.
3:13-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Jesus arrived from Galilee at the Jordan coming to John,
to be baptized by him. But John tried to prevent Him, saying, “I have need to
be baptized by You, and do You come to me?” But Jesus answering said to him, “Permit
it at this time; for in this way it is fitting for us to fulfill all
righteousness.” Then he permitted Him. After being baptized, Jesus came up
immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened, and he saw the
Spirit of God descending as a dove and lighting on Him, and behold, a voice out
of the heavens said, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleased.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew
3:13-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Father approved of Jesus Christ at His baptism,
by His miracles, wonders and signs, and at His ascension. Matt. 3:17; Acts
2:22; Heb. 1:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Men of Israel, listen to these words: Jesus the Nazarene, a
man attested to you by God with miracles and wonders and signs which God
performed through Him in your midst, just as you yourselves know—”  (Acts 2:22,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But to which of the angels has He ever said, “SIT AT MY RIGHT
HAND, UNTIL I MAKE YOUR ENEMIES A FOOTSTOOL FOR YOUR FEET”?”  (Hebrews 1:13,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He had a ministry to His disciples. The Sermon on the
Mount was a crash program to train them so they could reach the multitudes. He
had a ministry with His disciples to the tax collectors and the prostitutes. He
had a ministry in miracles and in parables. Matt. 20:28.</p>

<p class=Verses>“just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to
serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.&quot;” (Matthew 20:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 4:14-16, it was customary in the days of Jesus’
earthly ministry for men to read portions of the Word of God aloud in the
temples they visited. This was considered an honor. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and
news about Him spread through all the surrounding district. And He began
teaching in their synagogues and was praised by all. And He came to Nazareth,
where He had been brought up; and as was His custom, He entered the synagogue
on the Sabbath, and stood up to read.”  (Luke 4:14-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The reason for His ministry had been prophesied by
Isaiah. This was a dramatic occasion - the living Word, declaring the written
Word. John 1:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and
the Word was God.”  (John 1:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He had been anointed or set apart to preach the Gospel to
those who need salvation - to all humanity. He healed the broken hearted by
giving inner peace through salvation. The Gospels are full of the wonderful
miracles of healing, which our Lord performed. But greater still is the peace
and comfort which the Lord gives to believers in times of suffering. Psalms
34:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD is near to the brokenhearted And saves those who are
crushed in spirit.”  (Psalms 34:18, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He had been anointed to preach deliverance to all of
humanity so that we might be set free from the powers of darkness - Satan and
his fallen angels. Col. 1:13. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For He rescued us from the domain of darkness, and transferred
us to the kingdom of His beloved Son,” (Colossians 1:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He recovered sight for the physically blind, but He came
to heal the and the spiritually blind - unbelievers. John 8:12. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Jesus again spoke to them, saying, “I am the Light of the
world; he who follows Me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the Light
of life.”“  (John 8:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Isaiah 53:5, He was “crushed (spiritual death) for our
iniquities” so that we might go free and without blame. He paid the penalty.
Col. 2:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But He was pierced through for our transgressions, He was
crushed for our iniquities; The chastening for our well-being fell upon Him,
And by His scourging we are healed.”  (Isaiah 53:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“having canceled out the certificate of debt consisting of
decrees against us, which was hostile to us; and He has taken it out of the
way, having nailed it to the cross.”  (Colossians 2:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He came to proclaim the favorable year of the Lord which
means He was saying, “I am the long promised Redeemer.”</p>

<p class=Verses>““THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS UPON ME, BECAUSE HE ANOINTED ME TO
PREACH THE GOSPEL TO THE POOR. HE HAS SENT ME TO PROCLAIM RELEASE TO THE
CAPTIVES, AND RECOVERY OF SIGHT TO THE BLIND, TO SET FREE THOSE WHO ARE
OPPRESSED, TO PROCLAIM THE FAVORABLE YEAR OF THE LORD.”“  (Luke 4:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There were two reasons they stared at Him in Luke 4:20.
He had been reading from Isaiah 61:1-2. He quit right in the middle of verse 2
because the rest of the passage does not speak of His earthly ministry, but of
His Second Advent.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He closed the book, gave it back to the attendant and sat
down; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on Him.” (Luke 4:20,
NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me, Because the LORD has
anointed me To bring good news to the afflicted; He has sent me to bind up the
brokenhearted, To proclaim liberty to captives And freedom to prisoners; To
proclaim the favorable year of the LORD And the day of vengeance of our God; To
comfort all who mourn,”  (Isaiah 61:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He sat down and whoever heard of anyone sitting down
while ministering the Word? Even the high priests, who went into the Holy of
Holies, must stand in the presence of God. He dared sit and nothing happened to
Him. Heb. 10:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Every priest stands daily ministering and offering time after
time the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins;”  (Hebrews 10:11,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord then stated in Luke 4:21 that the passage that
He had just read aloud had just been fulfilled. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And He began to say to them, &quot;Today this Scripture has
been fulfilled in your hearing.&quot;” (Luke 4:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Their amazement soon turned to anger, for as the Lord
told them how few would believe, they chased Him out of the city and attempted
to throw Him over the edge to kill Him. Jesus worked a miracle. He walked right
through their midst without their seeing Him and escaped unharmed. Luke
4:29-30.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and they got up and drove Him out of the city, and led Him to
the brow of the hill on which their city had been built, in order to throw Him
down the cliff. But passing through their midst, He went His way.”  (Luke
4:29-30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Parable of the Sower </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are four categories of people in the Parable of the
Sower in Luke 8:4-8. </p>

<p class=Verses>“When a large crowd was coming together, and those from the
various cities were journeying to Him, He spoke by way of a parable: &quot;The
sower went out to sow his seed; and as he sowed, some fell beside the road, and
it was trampled under foot and the birds of the air ate it up. &quot;Other seed
fell on rocky soil, and as soon as it grew up, it withered away, because it had
no moisture. &quot;Other seed fell among the thorns; and the thorns grew up
with it and choked it out. &quot;Other seed fell into the good soil, and grew
up, and produced a crop a hundred times as great.&quot; As He said these
things, He would call out, &quot;He who has ears to hear, let him hear.&quot;”
(Luke 8:4-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In this parable, the seed represents the Word of God. The
seed falling “beside the road” represents unbelievers such as Judas Iscariot
whose heart has become hardened in their negative volition. Luke 8:11-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Now the parable is this: the seed is the word of God.
&quot;Those beside the road are those who have heard; then the devil comes and
takes away the word from their heart, so that they will not believe and be
saved.” (Luke 8:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The seed falling on a “rock” represents the new believer
like the disciples who had little residual doctrine in their souls. They are
excited about the Word, but over time become less and less interested. Luke
8:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Those on the rocky soil are those who, when they hear,
receive the word with joy; and these have no firm root; they believe for a
while, and in time of temptation fall away.” (Luke 8:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The seed falling “among the thorns” represents the
believer like Simon the Pharisee who is choked with the details of life. Simon
had only invited Christ over for dinner because doing so would improve his status
with the other Pharisees. Luke 8:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;The seed which fell among the thorns, these are the ones
who have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with worries and
riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to maturity.” (Luke 8:14,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The seed falling on “good soil” represents believers like
Mary Magdalene and characterizes the believer who learns and applies <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine from a soul and grows spiritually  without developing scar
tissue in their soul.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But the seed in the good soil, these are the ones who
have heard the word in an honest and good heart, and hold it fast, and bear
fruit with perseverance.” (Luke 8:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The application of the Parable of the Sower is found in Luke
8:16-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Now no one after lighting a lamp covers it over with a
container, or puts it under a bed; but he puts it on a lampstand, so that those
who come in may see the light. “For nothing is hidden that will not become
evident, nor anything secret that will not be known and come to light. “So take
care how you listen; for whoever has, to him more shall be given; and whoever
does not have, even what he thinks he has shall be taken away from him.”“ 
(Luke 8:16-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The unbeliever is not represented here because they
produce no light. The light covered with a container represents believers who
can’t take trials, are emotional, and not glorifying Christ. The light put
under a bed represents the believer who does not take in Bible doctrine daily
and so their soul apparatus is “choked” suffocated with the details of life
with the resultant scar tissue.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The light set on a lampstand represents the believer who
can take trials, is not choked with the details of life, and is consistently
learning and applying Bible doctrine to the situations in life. God is
glorified because these believers reflect the glory of God (His light). This
results in maximum impact and glorifies God. Consequently the “good soil”
believer erects an edification complex on <i>epignosis</i> based on residual
useable doctrine in the right lobe of the soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><img width=500 height=300 id="Picture 1"
src="Jesus%20Christ,%20Earthly%20Ministry.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Our Lord’s Finished Work</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 19:30, “It is finished!” refers to the work Jesus
Christ was sent to the earth to do – to die spiritually on the Cross for the
sins of all mankind. After His work was finished, Jesus Christ released His
human spirit resulting in His physical death.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore when Jesus had received the sour wine, He said,
&quot;It is finished!&quot; And He bowed His head and gave up His spirit.”
(John 19:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is undiminished deity and true humanity
united in one person forever. He died twice on the Cross. In Isaiah 53:9,
“death” in the original Hebrews text is really “deaths” and is the intensive
plural of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>מָוֶת</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(mâveth). </p>

<p class=Verses>“His grave was assigned with wicked men, Yet He was with a rich
man in His death, Because He had done no violence, Nor was there any deceit in
His mouth.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah 53:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>His humanity died spiritually when He, the innocent Lamb
of God, took the sins of the whole world upon Himself.  He died physically when
this work of dying for the sins of the whole world was finished. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He died spiritually in His humanity, not His deity in
bearing our sins. He had no fellowship with God the Father during the time He
was bearing the judgment of our sins. God the Holy Spirit sustained His
humanity’s soul through it all. Psalms 22:1; Matt. 27:46.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the choir director; upon Aijeleth Hashshahar. A Psalm of
David. My God, my God, why have You forsaken me? Far from my deliverance are
the words of my groaning.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 22:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“About the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice,
saying, “ELI, ELI, LAMA SABACHTHANI?” that is, “MY GOD, MY GOD, WHY HAVE YOU
FORSAKEN ME?”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 27:46, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Significance of His Finished Work </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>In Christianity the work is done.
We accept the finished work of Christ by accepting Him as our personal Savior.
Forgiveness is wrought when we personally believe in Him by faith alone. Then
we are to grow in grace by learning God’s Word categorically and applying it to
life’s experience. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Religion is man doing the work where God is supposed to
bless what is done and man gets the credit. Christianity is God doing the work
where man receives what God has done and God gets the credit and the glory. The
finished work of Christ is entirely and completely done. John 3:16; John 3:36.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For God so loved the world, that He gave His only
begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal
life.” (John 3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who
does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on
him.&quot;” (John 3:36, NASB)</p>
