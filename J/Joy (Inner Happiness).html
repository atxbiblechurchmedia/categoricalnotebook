<h2><a name="_Inner_Happiness"></a><a name="_D-Inner_Happiness"></a><a
name="_D-Happiness"></a><a name="_Happiness"></a>Joy (Inner Happiness)</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Happiness is older than the human race. God had perfect
happiness in eternity past as one of His perfect attributes. Happiness is
resident in the Trinity and is a result of God’s character. Galatians 5:22-23
describes the character of Christ, which includes joy.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,
patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against
such things there is no law.&quot;  (Galatians 5:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In eternity past, God desired to share His happiness with
man in time. This had to be done through salvation followed by growth to
spiritual maturity. Eph. 1:3. See category on the <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/D/Divine%20Decrees.html">Divine
Decrees</a>. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in
Christ,&quot;  (Ephesians 1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mankind enters the plan of God by faith in Jesus Christ,
therefore they as believers have the potential of happiness, beginning at
salvation, but dependent upon the building of an edification complex in the
soul. This salvation and subsequent intake of Bible doctrine bridges the gap
between God’s happiness and man’s happiness based purely on God’s grace
provision and resources. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Mental Attitude Happiness - <i>Agapao</i> Love </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mental attitude <i>agapao</i> love is an unconditional
love and is the absence of mental attitude sins. This is also called mental
attitude happiness. This love only functions while filled with the Holy Spirit
and involves application of the <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in your soul to
the situations you face in life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mental attitude happiness is the happiness or enjoyment
of giving, especially when the recipient cannot return the favor or they do not
know who gave the gift. This can be a one-way type of happiness. The believer
with mental attitude happiness regards giving gifts as a privilege. Mental
attitude happiness is enjoying the giving much more than receiving. They also
love to give of themselves to others. John 3:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For God so loved the world, that He gave His only
begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal
life.” (John 3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Capacity Happiness - <i>Phileo</i> Love</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Capacity happiness is personal <i>phileo</i> love and is
restricted to a select few whose attributes you are attracted to or admire.
Mental attitude happiness is mental attitude <i>agapao</i> love and is
unrestricted or unconditional. Capacity <i>phileo</i> love happiness is a
rapport relationship which is a giving and receiving relationship.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Phileo</i> love is a rapport or soul love in close
personal relationships. <i>Phileo</i> love involves emotional appreciation. <i>Phileo</i>
love is dependent upon the high and noble character in both parties. For
believers,<i> phileo</i> love is the overt expression between believers of
advancing maturity of doctrinal happiness. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Phileo</i> love gives the capacity to receive and
express appreciation without embarrassment. It involves not only the mental
attitude but the work and deed as well. <i>Phileo</i> love has a vocabulary of
expression, a plan of action, and a design for happiness. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Fulfillment Happiness - <i>Chara</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Fulfillment happiness is χαρά (chara) in the Greek and
is a reservoir of mental and capacity love expressed in tranquility, solitude,
and enthusiastic response. <i>Chara</i> is total or inner happiness, a blending
of unconditional mental attitude <i>agapao</i> love and personal <i>phileo</i>
love. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Chara</i> means to bring about the accomplishment of
something promised, hoped for, anticipated, to come to a satisfactory
conclusion. Psalms 37.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Trust in the LORD and do good; Dwell in the land and cultivate
faithfulness. Delight yourself in the LORD; And He will give you the desires of
your heart. Commit your way to the LORD, Trust also in Him, and He will do it.”
(Psalms 37:3-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Rest in the LORD and wait patiently for Him; Do not fret
because of him who prospers in his way, Because of the man who carries out
wicked schemes. Cease from anger and forsake wrath; Do not fret; it leads only
to evildoing.” (Psalms 37:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The steps of a man are established by the LORD, And He
delights in his way. When he falls, he will not be hurled headlong, Because the
LORD is the One who holds his hand.” (Psalms 37:23-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Chara</i> was the fulfillment or goal of John’s first
epistle. That was why it was written. Unconditional mental attitude <i>agapao</i>
love was included in attainment of that goal. John used <i>agape</i> or <i>agapao</i>
41 times. </p>

<p class=Verses>“The one who loves his brother abides in the Light and there is
no cause for stumbling in him.” (1 John 2:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do not love the world nor the things in the world. If anyone
loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.” (1 John 2:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“See how great a love the Father has bestowed on us, that we
would be called children of God; and such we are. For this reason the world
does not know us, because it did not know Him.” (1 John 3:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this is the message which you have heard from the
beginning, that we should love one another;” (1 John 3:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Chara</i> is the reservoir mental attitude that
protects from being disillusioned about the circumstances and details of life. 
Phil. 4:11-12; Heb. 13:5-6. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Not that I speak from want, for I have learned to be content
in whatever circumstances I am. I know how to get along with humble means, and
I also know how to live in prosperity; in any and every circumstance I have
learned the secret of being filled and going hungry, both of having abundance
and suffering need.” (Philippians 4:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Make sure that your character is free from the love of money,
being content with what you have; for He Himself has said, &quot;I WILL NEVER
DESERT YOU, NOR WILL I EVER FORSAKE YOU,&quot; so that we confidently say,
&quot;THE LORD IS MY HELPER, I WILL NOT BE AFRAID. WHAT WILL MAN DO TO
ME?&quot;” (Hebrews 13:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Chara</i> protects from being disillusioned about
other believers. There is great unhappiness in disillusionment and it gets you
away from Bible doctrine. You shouldn’t have your eyes on people in the first
place. Heb. 12:2; Jer. 17:5. </p>

<p class=Verses>“fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith,
who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has
sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.” (Hebrews 12:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Thus says the LORD, &quot;Cursed is the man who trusts in
mankind And makes flesh his strength, And whose heart turns away from the
LORD.” (Jeremiah 17:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Happiness or joy is the expression of mental attitude
love and capacity love and is not affected by lack of response. Happiness
expresses itself in a spectrum from tranquility or solitude to enthusiastic
emotional response. Jer. 15:16; John 13:17; 1 John 1:4. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Your words were found and I ate them, And Your words became
for me a joy and the delight of my heart; For I have been called by Your name,
O LORD God of hosts.” (Jeremiah 15:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;If you know these things, you are blessed if you do
them.” (John 13:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“These things we write, so that our joy may be made complete.”
(1 John 1:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Happiness is commanded for believers in Philippians 4:4.
God has made provision for carrying through the command. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice!”
(Philippians 4:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has designed happiness in the spiritual life to be
permanent and stabilized through the edification complex of the soul. John
17:13; John 17:17. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But now I come to You; and these things I speak in the
world so that they may have My joy made full in themselves.” (John 17:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth.” (John
17:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Millennium, God will provide maximum happiness for
the ones who lack resources in the power of their own personalities and the
ones who will be going through a lot of suffering. Those who endure suffering
will be comforted. Matt. 5:3-4. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the
kingdom of heaven. &quot;Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be
comforted.” (Matthew 5:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Millennium, God will also provide maximum
happiness for the ones who will be obedient even in suffering and those who
will have a character like that of Jesus Christ, Moses, David and Paul. Matt.
5:5-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Blessed are the gentle, for they shall inherit the
earth. &quot;Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for
they shall be satisfied.” (Matthew 5:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Synonyms for Happiness</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Happiness is defined as a state of well-being. Therefore,
in our English language, happiness is tantamount to welfare and prosperity.
Happiness is the enjoyment of and the pleasure in one's status in life,
circumstances of life, and relationships of life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The word “felicity” is a very beautiful and interesting
Old English word. It connotes great happiness. The English word “beatitude”
connotes supreme or maximum felicity. So we have happiness, felicity and
beatitude denoting in our English language that there are degrees of happiness.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Blessedness, however, refers to happiness related to God
and His plan. Blessed or blessedness occurs many times in the Scripture. We
must remember what is meant by the words blessed or blessedness, happy, or
happiness in the plural. The plural use of the noun denotes a happiness
spectrum which can run from tranquility to great emotional response. Therefore,
happiness becomes a state or quality of being. In other words, the quality of
being happy from the standpoint of inner happiness.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Happiness, in its fullest meaning, is the utmost pleasure
we are capable of enjoying in any given situation. Because we are referring to
inner happiness, it can be a situation of prosperity or suffering. Remember,
receiving and retaining inner happiness is something being possessed within our
souls and is not conditioned by any overt situation or circumstance.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To generalize, happiness as defined in our English
language, denotes welfare, comfort, security, and our overall enjoyment of
life. Happiness is also an awareness that one's status is very satisfactory, is
in a favorable condition, and in advantageous circumstances. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We have seen eight examples of the way happiness is used
in the English language. However, this does not begin to explain all that
happiness is or can be or should be from the biblical teaching on the subject.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Happiness and Relationships</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Happiness is related to blessing. Psalms 128:1-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; A Song of Ascents. How blessed is everyone who fears the
LORD, Who walks in His ways. When you shall eat of the fruit of your hands, You
will be happy and it will be well with you. Your wife shall be like a fruitful
vine Within your house, Your children like olive plants Around your table.
Behold, for thus shall the man be blessed Who fears the LORD.&quot;  (Psalms
128:1-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Happiness is related to suffering. 1 Peter 3:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But even if you should suffer for the sake of
righteousness, you are blessed. AND DO NOT FEAR THEIR INTIMIDATION, AND DO NOT
BE TROUBLED,&quot;  (1 Peter 3:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Happiness is related to Bible doctrine. Prov. 3:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;How blessed is the man who finds wisdom And the man who
gains understanding.&quot;  (Proverbs 3:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Happiness is related to grace function. Prov. 14:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He who despises his neighbor sins, But happy is he who is
gracious to the poor.&quot;  (Proverbs 14:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Happiness is related to spiritual maturity. Psalms 146:5;
Prov. 16:20; Prov. 28:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;How blessed is he whose help is the God of Jacob, Whose
hope is in the LORD his God,&quot;  (Psalms 146:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He who gives attention to the word will find good, And
blessed is he who trusts in the LORD.&quot;  (Proverbs 16:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;How blessed is the man who fears always, But he who
hardens his heart will fall into calamity.&quot;  (Proverbs 28:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Happiness is related to a clear conscience. Rom. 14:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The faith which you have, have as your own conviction
before God. Happy is he who does not condemn himself in what he
approves.&quot;  (Romans 14:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Happiness is related to the laws of divine establishment.
Prov. 29:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Where there is no vision, the people are unrestrained,
But happy is he who keeps the law.&quot;  (Proverbs 29:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Happiness is related to complete military victory. Psalms
137:8-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;O daughter of Babylon, you devastated one, How blessed
will be the one who repays you With the recompense with which you have repaid
us. How blessed will be the one who seizes and dashes your little ones Against
the rock.&quot;  (Psalms 137:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Happiness is related to national blessing. Psalms 144:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;How blessed are the people who are so situated; How
blessed are the people whose God is the LORD!&quot;  (Psalms 144:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Happiness and the Essence of God</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The essence of God is the basis for receiving and
retaining great inner happiness in life. God designed this happiness for
believers to be permanent and stabilized. If we are ever going to possess any
happiness that is worthwhile, it must be linked to who and what God is. God is
perfect and His character is perfect. Therefore, perfect character possesses
perfect happiness. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is immutable (unchangeable), therefore, His happiness
is immutable. God can never change. God cannot change from happiness to
unhappiness. You can, I can, but God cannot! </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is perfect righteousness. His happiness is related to
the fact that He is absolutely correct and morally perfect. We must realize
that God can never be wrong and never will be wrong. This means God always
knows exactly what He is doing.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is perfect justice. Therefore, His happiness is
always related to His unchanging and absolute fairness. God has never been
unfair! It is impossible for God to be unfair! His happiness is related to the
fact that He is never unfair. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is love. His happiness is related to His love. This
happiness is related to both divine unconditional love and divine personal
love.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is omnipotent. He has the eternal ability to be
happy. He has the ability to share His happiness, but always on the principle
of grace. The principle of grace simply states that everything depends upon who
and what God is. Nothing depends on who and what man is!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is omniscient. His perfect infinite genius makes Him
happy. He has found a way to share this inner happiness with mankind.
Sometimes, intelligent people are not always happy because they understand too
much, know too much, or anticipate too much. They can see too far ahead of
ignorant people. We've all heard the expression, “fat, dumb, and happy.” Dumb
and happy is right! Ignorant people do not know or care about what is going to
happen tomorrow. The point is that it’s much more difficult for an intelligent
person to be happy than it is for an ignorant person to be happy. God always
has and always will possess perfect “smarts.” God has always been happy and
there will never be a time when He will be unhappy.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is sovereignty. He made a decision to share His
happiness with believers in time. For example, in Psalm 43:3, David is dancing
with tremendous emotion. David's dancing is related to the fact that God has
perfect happiness and shares it.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;O send out Your light and Your truth, let them lead me;
Let them bring me to Your holy hill And to Your dwelling places.&quot;  (Psalms
43:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Happiness is Based on the Plan of God</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Because of God’s perfect and eternal happiness, He
desires to share this happiness with man. However, this applies only to
believers! In eternity past, God found a way to do this through grace without
compromising His essence. Through His divine plan, God found a way to give us
His happiness without losing His own happiness. There is absolutely no
compromise of God's holiness when He gives us His happiness. Psalms 97:12;
Zech. 10:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Be glad in the LORD, you righteous ones, And give thanks
to His holy name.&quot;  (Psalms 97:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Ephraim will be like a mighty man, And their heart
will be glad as if from wine; Indeed, their children will see it and be glad,
Their heart will rejoice in the LORD.&quot;  (Zechariah 10:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The entrance into God's plan is salvation through faith
in Jesus Christ. This is the beginning of grace function within the plan of God
for believers. Psalms 9:14; Psalms 51:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;That I may tell of all Your praises, That in the gates of
the daughter of Zion I may rejoice in Your salvation.&quot;  (Psalms 9:14,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Restore to me the joy of Your salvation And sustain me
with a willing spirit.&quot;  (Psalms 51:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There was great happiness evidenced at the dedication of
the Second Temple. Neh. 12:43.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and on that day they offered great sacrifices and
rejoiced because God had given them great joy, even the women and children
rejoiced, so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard from afar.&quot;  (Nehemiah
12:43, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Happiness is Based on Grace </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Since happiness is based on the grace of God, it is
accomplished through the intake and obedience to Bible doctrine. Psalms 31:7;
Psalms 32:10-11; Psalms 33:4-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I will rejoice and be glad in Your lovingkindness,
Because You have seen my affliction; You have known the troubles of my
soul,&quot;  (Psalms 31:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Many are the sorrows of the wicked, But he who trusts in
the LORD, lovingkindness shall surround him. Be glad in the LORD and rejoice,
you righteous ones; And shout for joy, all you who are upright in heart.&quot; 
(Psalms 32:10-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For the word of the LORD is upright, And all His work is
done in faithfulness. He loves righteousness and justice; The earth is full of
the lovingkindness of the LORD.&quot;  (Psalms 33:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>However, this inner happiness or sharing the happiness of
God must have a starting point. The starting point is entrance into God's plan
by the appropriation of eternal salvation through faith in the Lord Jesus
Christ. Being saved does not mean automatic or instant happiness. Just because
you are saved does not mean you are guaranteed happiness!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Inner happiness or God's happiness is still a potential
to the Christian and depends upon their spiritual growth through the daily
intake and obedience to Bible truth. The first taste of inner happiness comes
from the filling of God the Holy Spirit. Happiness is the extension of a
relaxed mental attitude. Such happiness is a mental attitude of joy. Gal. 5:22;
Rom. 14:17; 1 Thess. 1:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,
patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,&quot;  (Galatians 5:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but
righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.&quot;  (Romans 14:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;You also became imitators of us and of the Lord, having
received the word in much tribulation with the joy of the Holy Spirit,&quot; 
(1 Thessalonians 1:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The experience of inner happiness is limited by the
capacity developed from learning and applying Bible doctrine from positive
volition. If you have <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the right lobe of your
soul, you have capacity for great happiness. As a new believer, you lack this
capacity and only have the filling of the Spirit without any Bible teaching in
your soul as yet. In order to have great inner happiness on a daily basis
regardless of any circumstance in life, we must possess maximum doctrine in our
soul. This provides the spiritual dynamic to remain Spirit-filled a maximum
amount of the time on a daily basis. The spiritually mature believer carries the
same happiness whether circumstances are pleasant or unpleasant.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As you mature spiritually through the intake and
application of God's Word, the Lord increasingly shares His own happiness with
you. John 17:13; John 17:17; 1 John 1:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;But now I come to You; and these things I speak in
the world so that they may have My joy made full in themselves. &quot;  (John
17:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth.
&quot;  (John 17:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;These things we write, so that our joy may be made
complete.&quot;  (1 John 1:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Happiness Is the Status of the Mature Believer </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Happiness is the status of the mature believer based on
consistent intake and application of the Word of God to life and circumstances.
This joy or happiness is appropriated by the believer through the filling of
the Holy Spirit using the grace apparatus for perception. Joy is not some
emotional turbulence. Joy is inner orientation to the grace of God. This
consistent spiritual growth leads to the understanding of God’s plan and the
resulting sharing of His very own happiness. Neh. 8:10; Psalms 30:5; Psalms
30:11; 1 Peter 1:8. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then he said to them, &quot;Go, eat of the fat, drink of
the sweet, and send portions to him who has nothing prepared; for this day is
holy to our Lord. Do not be grieved, for the joy of the LORD is your
strength.&quot;&quot;  (Nehemiah 8:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For His anger is but for a moment, His favor is for a
lifetime; Weeping may last for the night, But a shout of joy comes in the
morning.&quot;  (Psalms 30:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;You have turned for me my mourning into dancing; You have
loosed my sackcloth and girded me with gladness,&quot;  (Psalms 30:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and though you have not seen Him, you love Him, and
though you do not see Him now, but believe in Him, you greatly rejoice with joy
inexpressible and full of glory,&quot;  (1 Peter 1:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer is commanded to be happy and God never makes
a command unless He provides a plan, a way for provision. Philippians 4:4 is an
order to have inner happiness, God’s happiness.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say,
rejoice!&quot;  (Philippians 4:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Happiness is Related to Blessing</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Old and New Testament, “blessed” is a plural noun
for happiness - literally, happinesses. Happiness provided by God is always in
the plural – happinesses. The reason is for both temporal and spiritual
blessing. The Hebrew word for “blessed” in Psalms 41:2 is <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>אשׁר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> ('âshêr). In John 13:17, the Greek word for “blessed” is <span
lang=EL>μακα</span>́<span lang=EL>ριος</span> (makarios). </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;If you know these things, you are blessed if you
do them. &quot;  (John 13:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The LORD will protect him and keep him alive, And he
shall be called blessed upon the earth; And do not give him over to the desire
of his enemies.&quot;  (Psalms 41:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is a great spectrum of happiness. Inner happiness
manifests itself in many different ways and in different circumstances. There
is happiness (joy) from the filling of the Spirit and from the edification
complex of the soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Protection From Disillusionment</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Inner happiness protects the Christian from being
disillusioned. There are three basic areas of disillusionment in life;
disillusionment from the circumstances of life, disillusionment from the
details of life, and disillusionment from people. Phil. 4:11-12; Heb. 13:5-6;
Heb. 12:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Not that I speak from want, for I have learned to be
content in whatever circumstances I am. I know how to get along with humble
means, and I also know how to live in prosperity; in any and every circumstance
I have learned the secret of being filled and going hungry, both of having
abundance and suffering need.&quot;  (Philippians 4:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; Make sure that your character is free from the love of
money, being content with what you have; for He Himself has said, &quot;I WILL
NEVER DESERT YOU, NOR WILL I EVER FORSAKE YOU,&quot; so that we confidently
say, &quot;THE LORD IS MY HELPER, I WILL NOT BE AFRAID. WHAT WILL MAN DO TO
ME?&quot;&quot;  (Hebrews 13:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses
surrounding us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so
easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before
us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the
joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at
the right hand of the throne of God.&quot;  (Hebrews 12:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sooner or later, you will discover that just because a
person is a Christian does not mean that they are nice, honest, truthful or
even dependable. Disillusionment with believers is a very serious and very
dangerous situation because you may use this as an excuse to get away from
Bible doctrine. When you get away from the Word, the Angelic Conflict knocks
you out. You shouldn’t have your eyes on people in the first place! We are all
human, we all have an old sin nature, and we all have areas of weakness in that
sin nature. Jer. 17:5. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Thus says the LORD, &quot;Cursed is the man who trusts in
mankind And makes flesh his strength, And whose heart turns away from the
LORD.&quot;  (Jeremiah 17:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Paul’s Troubles with the Corinthians </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The causes of Paul’s troubles with the Corinthians were
many and can be summarized in one word, pressure. The pressures were both
external and internal. 2 Cor. 7:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For even when we came into Macedonia our flesh had no
rest, but we were afflicted on every side: conflicts without, fears
within.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 7:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 7:6-7, Paul had received the encouraging
report from Titus regarding success with correcting the Corinthians. Titus was
sent by Paul to Corinth following the previous failure of Timothy and Apollos
to correct the Corinthians. The Corinthians had mental attitude sins toward
Paul and toward Apollos. Under Titus, their carnality had been changed to
spirituality through consistent confession of sins biblically.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But God, who comforts the depressed, comforted us by the
coming of Titus; and not only by his coming, but also by the comfort with which
he was comforted in you, as he reported to us your longing, your mourning, your
zeal for me; so that I rejoiced even more.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 7:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Titus was the type of person around whom Paul could relax
and have rapport with him. Paul enjoyed being with him. Titus had the ability
to snap Paul out of depression and disillusionment. When Titus was in Corinth,
he straightened things out. Titus was encouraged and he in turn encouraged
Paul. Titus had the touch of leadership, that knack of using authority to
straighten things out. As a result there was great happiness.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Your longing” is <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>πιπο</span>́<span
lang=EL>θησις</span> (epipothēsis) in the Greek and means true love that never
changes regardless of the circumstances! They had a great love and desire to
hear the Apostle Paul. “Your mourning” is <span lang=EL>ο</span>̓<span lang=EL>δυρμο</span>́<span
lang=EL>ς</span> (odurmos) in the Greek and mean a loud and noisy lamentation
at a funeral. Once Titus began to clarify the issues, they began to realize
that they have done a very terrible thing. They had spoken against Paul and had
mental attitude sins against him. They got very emotional about it, which did
not advance them spiritually. Doctrine had now become first priority in their
life. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You can be filled with the Spirit and be despondent, have
a headache, feel bad or feel good or feel nothing. Emotion is fun, but it does
not have spiritual connotations. Their desire towards Bible doctrine was the
great encouragement to Paul. “So that I rejoiced even more” is true happiness.
There must be distinction between emotion and achieving divine happiness. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Divine Happiness Test</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 24:38-39, our Lord appeared to His disciples in
His resurrection body. They were startled and frightened at first, but our Lord
calmed them down.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He said to them, &quot;Why are you troubled, and why
do doubts arise in your hearts? &quot;See My hands and My feet, that it is I
Myself; touch Me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see
that I have.&quot; &quot;  (Luke 24:38-39, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 24:40-41, although they had “joy and amazement,”
they “still could not believe” or <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>πιστε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (apisteō) in the Greek which means to disbelieve, to be
faithless. The present active participle of <span lang=EL>από</span><span
lang=EL> </span><span lang=EL>της</span><span lang=EL> </span><span lang=EL>χαράς</span>,
“because of their joy and amazement” means that they were separated at this
point from happiness!</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and
His feet. While they still could not believe it because of their joy and
amazement, He said to them, &quot;Have you anything here to eat?&quot; &quot; 
(Luke 24:40-41, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 24:44, Christ wished to illustrate fulfillment of
the edification complex of the soul. He was emphasizing the importance of face
to face teaching. “Things which are written about Me” refers to Calvary,
resurrection, etc. - all that were fulfilled as per the Scriptures! Christ
wished them to be fulfilled in the area of spiritual maturity, to have true
inner happiness, divine happiness. “Must be fulfilled” is the aorist passive
infinitive of <span lang=EL>πληρο</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (plēroō),
which means to fulfill a deficiency, fill with a certain quality, to fully
influence, or to fully possess.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now He said to them, &quot;These are My words which I
spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things which are written
about Me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be
fulfilled.&quot; &quot;  (Luke 24:44, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Disciples Pass the Happiness Test </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 24:49, Jesus Christ used His authority about
God’s promises. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;And behold, I am sending forth the promise of My
Father upon you; but you are to stay in the city until you are clothed with
power from on high.&quot; &quot;  (Luke 24:49, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 24:50-51, we see the use of “blessing” which is
the aorist active indicative of <span lang=EL>ευ</span>̓<span lang=EL>λογε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (eulogeō) and means to speak well of, to praise, to
acknowledge happiness, joy in one. This is just before the ascension! </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He led them out as far as Bethany, and He lifted up
His hands and blessed them. While He was blessing them, He parted from them and
was carried up into heaven.&quot;  (Luke 24:50-51, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 24:52-53 we see the use of “joy.” “After
worshiping Him” is the aorist active participle of <span lang=EL>προσκυνε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (proskuneō) and means to kiss the hand in token of reverence.
The separation from joy has now been replaced with the possession of joy! They
were in the temple continually praising God as an expression of their happiness
toward God.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And they, after worshiping Him, returned to Jerusalem
with great joy, and were continually in the temple praising God.&quot;  (Luke
24:52-53, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Capacity for Love</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has designed the Christian way of life so happiness
will be permanent and stabilized through the construction of the edification
complex of the soul. The <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the edification
complex sustains the believer in every circumstance. Inner happiness from <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine in the soul stimulates and increases the believer’s capacity for
true virtue love. 1 Peter 1:8; John 13:17; John 17:17; 1 John 1:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and though you have not seen Him, you love Him, and
though you do not see Him now, but believe in Him, you greatly rejoice with joy
inexpressible and full of glory,&quot;  (1 Peter 1:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;If you know these things, you are blessed if you
do them. &quot;  (John 13:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth.
&quot;  (John 17:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;These things we write, so that our joy may be made
complete.&quot;  (1 John 1:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Such joy or inner mental happiness exhibits itself in a
capacity to love, an overt rapport toward God, family and others. Such
happiness is an indication of living in the Word. Matt. 4:4; Jer. 15:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But He answered and said, &quot;It is written, 'MAN SHALL
NOT LIVE ON BREAD ALONE, BUT ON EVERY WORD THAT PROCEEDS OUT OF THE MOUTH OF
GOD.'&quot; &quot;  (Matthew 4:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Your words were found and I ate them, And Your words
became for me a joy and the delight of my heart; For I have been called by Your
name, O LORD God of hosts.&quot;  (Jeremiah 15:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Heavenly Happiness</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is the happiness of the perfect environment and
perfect conditions of heaven which will accrue to every believer. There is a
special blessing and happiness in heaven for believers who matured spiritually
in time and received wonderful blessings from God during their lives. Because
of this, they will also receive even more wonderful rewards in heaven. These
heavenly rewards are over and above the normal grace happiness of heaven which
will be possessed by all believers in eternity. Jude 1:24; Eph. 1:18. See
category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/QR/Rewards.html">Rewards (Crowns).</a></p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling, and to
make you stand in the presence of His glory blameless with great joy,&quot; 
(Jude 1:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened,
so that you will know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of
the glory of His inheritance in the saints,&quot;  (Ephesians 1:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Happiness in the Millennium</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is a wonderful happiness which is a part of the
perfect environment of the Millennium. This happiness does not exist today in
this devil's world. What the mature believer possesses by way of inner
happiness is even greater than the perfect environment happiness of the
Millennium. Isaiah 35:1-2; Isaiah 60:4-5; Isaiah 65:18-19; Isaiah 66:10. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The wilderness and the desert will be glad, And the
Arabah will rejoice and blossom; Like the crocus It will blossom profusely And
rejoice with rejoicing and shout of joy. The glory of Lebanon will be given to
it, The majesty of Carmel and Sharon. They will see the glory of the LORD, The
majesty of our God.&quot;  (Isaiah 35:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Lift up your eyes round about and see; They all
gather together, they come to you. Your sons will come from afar, And your
daughters will be carried in the arms. &quot;Then you will see and be radiant,
And your heart will thrill and rejoice; Because the abundance of the sea will
be turned to you, The wealth of the nations will come to you.&quot;  (Isaiah
60:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;But be glad and rejoice forever in what I create;
For behold, I create Jerusalem for rejoicing And her people for gladness.
&quot;I will also rejoice in Jerusalem and be glad in My people; And there will
no longer be heard in her The voice of weeping and the sound of crying.&quot; 
(Isaiah 65:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Be joyful with Jerusalem and rejoice for her, all
you who love her; Be exceedingly glad with her, all you who mourn over
her,&quot;  (Isaiah 66:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This same Millennial happiness is described by our Lord
in the familiar beatitudes in the Gospels. This Millennial happiness comes from
the perfect rulership of the Lord Jesus Christ who will be ruling under the
laws of divine establishment under perfect environment.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Human Happiness</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is a happiness which is common to all members of
the human race which is distinct and totally removed from inner happiness for
believers. All happiness is not related to God. Some happiness is even related
to sin and evil.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Happiness based upon sin and evil is evanescent (i.e., it
is there for a moment and then it is gone). There are certain types of sin and
the influence of evil that bring a short-lived happiness. This happiness is
very temporary and usually turns around and causes great misery.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Common happiness is a legitimate happiness for both
believers and unbelievers. This happiness comes from observing the laws of
divine establishment. This is happiness in possessing and appreciating freedom,
marriage, family life, and happiness because you are not living as a criminal.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Temporary happiness emanates from the details of life and
the stimulation and pleasure that people receive from them. Sometimes, this
type of happiness can also emanate from sin or evil. This is a very temporary
and superficial type of happiness. Temporary happiness is pleasure and
stimulation of the unbeliever who has rejected the rule of law and the laws of
divine establishment and the Christian who has rejected the same while
rejecting Bible doctrine. This happiness depends upon a pleasant environment, the
details of life, and stimulating circumstances. This same happiness comes from
having your own way. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Happiness based upon sin or evil as well as this very
temporary happiness of having your own way, can produce great boredom,
restlessness, frustration, and instability. All of these negative experiences
in life neutralize true happiness. They vanish like a vapor trail! These types
of temporary happiness also produce some of the greatest bitterness in life.
Ecclesiastes 9:9 and Ecclesiastes 11:8-9 deal with this temporal happiness
related to sin and evil.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Enjoy life with the woman whom you love all the days of
your fleeting life which He has given to you under the sun; for this is your
reward in life and in your toil in which you have labored under the sun.&quot; 
(Ecclesiastes 9:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Indeed, if a man should live many years, let him rejoice
in them all, and let him remember the days of darkness, for they will be many.
Everything that is to come will be futility. Rejoice, young man, during your
childhood, and let your heart be pleasant during the days of young manhood. And
follow the impulses of your heart and the desires of your eyes. Yet know that
God will bring you to judgment for all these things.&quot;  (Ecclesiastes
11:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Family happiness is the pleasure, satisfaction, and
stimulation parents receive when their children turn out all right. Children
can make you happy or children can make you miserable. Whichever way family
happiness goes, you can still receive and retain inner happiness through
functioning in accordance with the plan of God for your life through the intake
of God’s Word. Prov. 23:24-25</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice, And he
who sires a wise son will be glad in him. Let your father and your mother be
glad, And let her rejoice who gave birth to you.&quot;  (Proverbs 23:24-25,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Happiness prior to salvation is temporary and
superficial. It does not sustain the believer under pressure or adversity. Is
fleeting and unstable. It is impossible for an unbeliever to achieve the inner
happiness of the believer because the unbeliever’s happiness depends upon
circumstances which are favorable. This belongs to the believer in the Lord
Jesus Christ and is one of the byproducts of Christianity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The unbeliever is a slave to circumstances and if the
circumstances are right, they are happy. If the circumstances are unpleasant,
they are miserable. The unbeliever cannot rise above their circumstances. They
can only compensate through sublimation, escapism, etc., and at the other end
of the line, they have the same old misery. In contrast, the believer has
something which is fantastic - joy (inner happiness) in the midst of all kinds
of circumstances. Phil. 4:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Not that I speak from want, for I have learned to be
content in whatever circumstances I am.&quot;  (Philippians 4:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Often, the tragedy is that the believer imitates the
unbeliever, operating in the power of the old sin nature. As long as the
believer operates in the power of the old sin nature, you can’t tell them from
the unbeliever and they bypass the joy that is the monopoly of the believer.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Principles of Happiness</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Negative Principles</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You cannot build your happiness on someone else’s
unhappiness. You cannot build your happiness on the details of life. You cannot
build your happiness on pleasant environment. You cannot build your happiness
on loved ones. You cannot build your happiness on fame or being a celebrity.
You cannot build your happiness on the overthrow of establishment by violent
revolution. You cannot build your happiness on lust.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Positive Principles</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You can build your happiness on maximum <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine in your soul. This is the only happiness that has any
permanence. You can build your happiness on the daily intake and application of
Bible doctrine to the point of spiritual maturity. Therefore, you can build
your happiness on reaching spiritual maturity and receiving God’s blessings
while on this earth. Furthermore, you will have happiness from the capacity to
receive and enjoy these blessings.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You can build your happiness by glorifying God in
reaching and retaining spiritual maturity. You can build your happiness by your
continued spiritual growth as a mature believer, all the way to the maximum
happiness of dying grace. Dying grace is maximum inner happiness with no
regrets. You can build your happiness by observing the laws of divine
establishment. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/D/Dying%20Grace.html">Dying Grace</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Your Inner Happiness Overflows to Others</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Other believers are made happy by the overflow of another
believer’s inner happiness. Phil. 2:28-29; Rom. 15:32; Philemon 1:7; 1 Cor.
16:17-18; 2 Cor. 7:13</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore I have sent him all the more eagerly so that
when you see him again you may rejoice and I may be less concerned about you.
Receive him then in the Lord with all joy, and hold men like him in high
regard;&quot;  (Philippians 2:28-29, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;so that I may come to you in joy by the will of God and
find refreshing rest in your company.&quot;  (Romans 15:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For I have come to have much joy and comfort in your
love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you,
brother.&quot;  (Philemon 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I rejoice over the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and
Achaicus, because they have supplied what was lacking on your part. For they
have refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore acknowledge such men.&quot;  (1
Corinthians 16:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For this reason we have been comforted. And besides our
comfort, we rejoiced even much more for the joy of Titus, because his spirit
has been refreshed by you all.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 7:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Philemon 1:7, the Apostle Paul had received and
retained the inner happiness of spiritual maturity. In addition to this
happiness, he also enjoyed the happiness that overflowed from his fellowship
relationship with other spiritually mature Christians. Specifically, in
Philemon 1:7, he was referring to his friend and fellow laborer in the Lord,
Philemon. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This passage relates a happiness received from contact
with other Christians who are spiritually mature and, therefore, have received
and retained inner happiness. Philippians 4:4 commands us to rejoice in the
Lord at all times! The believer is commanded to the happy and God never makes a
command unless He provides a way for its fulfilment. The verb to “rejoice” in
the Greek is <span lang=EL>χαι</span>́<span lang=EL>ρω</span> (chairō) and
means to possess inner happiness. It is repeated in this verse to give emphasis
to the importance of growing up spiritually and possessing a share in the
happiness of God.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say,
rejoice!&quot;  (Philippians 4:4, NASB)</p>
