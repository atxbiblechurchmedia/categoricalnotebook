<h2>Jesus Christ’s Temptations</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first temptation of our Lord dealt with the
relationship of Christ to the indwelling Holy Spirit. Jesus Christ was tempted
to operate independently of God the Father’s plan and will. The temptation was
designed by Satan to force Jesus Christ to violate the kenosis principle and
rely on the omnipotence of His deity. This temptation was unique because it
involved the power to convert stones to bread. Matt. 4:1-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be
tempted by the devil. And after He had fasted forty days and forty nights, He
then became hungry. And the tempter came and said to Him, “If You are the Son
of God, command that these stones become bread.” But He answered and said, “It
is written, ‘MAN SHALL NOT LIVE ON BREAD ALONE, BUT ON EVERY WORD THAT PROCEEDS
OUT OF THE MOUTH OF GOD.’““&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 4:1-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer is constantly tempted to rely on their own
abilities to produce human good rather than the enabling power of the Holy
Spirit to produce divine good.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The second temptation of Jesus Christ dealt with
relationship with the Word. Satan attacked the source of resistance. Satan
attacked the Word by misquoting and distorting the Word and using a passage out
of context. Matt. 4:5-7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the devil took Him into the holy city and had Him stand
on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to Him, “If You are the Son of God,
throw Yourself down; for it is written, ‘HE WILL COMMAND HIS ANGELS CONCERNING
YOU’; and ‘ON their HANDS THEY WILL BEAR YOU UP, SO THAT YOU WILL NOT STRIKE
YOUR FOOT AGAINST A STONE.’“ Jesus said to him, “On the other hand, it is
written, ‘YOU SHALL NOT PUT THE LORD YOUR GOD TO THE TEST.’““&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew
4:5-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan distorted Psalm 91:11-12 in Matthew 4:5-6 by adding
the words “so that” in verse 6 which means “lest at any time.” For Jesus Christ
to jump would defy the law of gravity. God does not protect the operation of
negative volition in defiance of a divine law. It would apply, of course, if
someone pushed Jesus. There is no protection for anyone acting independent of
the Word or distorting the Word.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For He will give His angels charge concerning you, To guard
you in all your ways. They will bear you up in their hands, That you do not
strike your foot against a stone.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 91:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the devil took Him into the holy city and had Him stand
on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to Him, “If You are the Son of God,
throw Yourself down; for it is written, ‘HE WILL COMMAND HIS ANGELS CONCERNING
YOU’; and ‘ON their HANDS THEY WILL BEAR YOU UP, SO THAT YOU WILL NOT STRIKE
YOUR FOOT AGAINST A STONE.’““&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 4:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are times when God’s protection is promised. When
the believer uses their own volition to operate outside of God’s Word or mandates,
there is no protection from God. God does not protect a believer from death by
suicide. By committing suicide, the believer deprives himself of further
rewards. For Jesus to jump would have been certain death for His humanity. It
was not the Father’s will for Him to jump. The woman (Eve) sinned in the Garden
through distortion of the Word in a similar manner. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Jesus said to him, “On the other hand, it is written, ‘YOU
SHALL NOT PUT THE LORD YOUR GOD TO THE TEST.’““&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 4:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus turns a first-class condition back on Satan in
Matthew 4:7. It is satanic to tempt the Lord. Satan quoted Scripture which did
not apply. Jesus only used applicable Scripture. To all believers who are
tempted to commit suicide, this is worldliness and satanic. Your departure from
the earth must be strictly by the sovereignty of God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The third temptation of our Lord dealt with His relationship
with God through the Father’s plan. It is the plan of God that Jesus Christ
should rule the world, but the plan also demands that the Cross be before the
crown. Without the Cross, there can be no kingdom established or redeemed
individuals. Matt. 4:8-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Again, the devil took Him to a very high mountain and showed
Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory; and he said to Him, “All
these things I will give You, if You fall down and worship me.” Then Jesus said
to him, “Go, Satan! For it is written, ‘YOU SHALL WORSHIP THE LORD YOUR GOD,
AND SERVE HIM ONLY.’“ Then the devil *left Him; and behold, angels came and
began to minister to Him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 4:8-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the third temptation, Satan offered a plan that
bypassed the Cross. The offer of Satan to give Jesus Christ the kingdoms of the
world was bonafide because Satan is the ruler. Satan’s plan always ignores,
rejects, and obscures the Cross. This temptation which is rejected by the Lord
Jesus Christ will be accepted by the Beast in the Tribulation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In summary, Jesus Christ, the Last Adam, did not sin as did
the first Adam. Jesus Christ is the victor in the Angelic Conflict. Hebrews 1
and 2.</p>
