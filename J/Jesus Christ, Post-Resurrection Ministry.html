<h2>Jesus Christ, Post-Resurrection Ministry </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The most intense crash program of teaching Bible doctrine
in all of human history was the 40-day ministry of Jesus Christ after His
resurrection. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Apostle Peter Example </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Peter was not ready for the Cross. He was grace-oriented,
had mastered the details of life and had a relaxed mental attitude. Luke
22:31-34.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has demanded permission to
sift you like wheat; but I have prayed for you, that your faith may not fail;
and you, when once you have turned again, strengthen your brothers.&quot; But
he said to Him, &quot;Lord, with You I am ready to go both to prison and to
death!&quot; And He said, &quot;I say to you, Peter, the rooster will not crow
today until you have denied three times that you know Me.&quot;” (Luke
22:31-34, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Peter failed the rapport love test by denying three times
that he knew our Lord. Luke 22:54-62.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And a servant-girl, seeing him as he sat in the firelight and
looking intently at him, said, &quot;This man was with Him too.&quot; But he
denied it, saying, &quot;Woman, I do not know Him.&quot;” (Luke 22:56-57, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“A little later, another saw him and said, &quot;You are one of
them too!&quot; But Peter said, &quot;Man, I am not!&quot;” (Luke 22:58, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But Peter said, &quot;Man, I do not know what you are talking
about.&quot; Immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.” (Luke
22:60, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 2:22-24, Peter spoke with confidence in the Cross
and our Lord’s resurrection. How could Peter stabilize so quickly? Because of
the post-resurrection ministry of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Men of Israel, listen to these words: Jesus the
Nazarene, a man attested to you by God with miracles and wonders and signs
which God performed through Him in your midst, just as you yourselves know—
this Man, delivered over by the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God,
you nailed to a cross by the hands of godless men and put Him to death.
&quot;But God raised Him up again, putting an end to the agony of death, since
it was impossible for Him to be held in its power.” (Acts 2:22-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Book of Matthew Emphasis</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 28:18-20, there are two major communication
gifts mentioned – evangelism and pastor-teacher. The command to the evangelist in
Matthew 28:19 is not just to “go,” but to “Go therefore and make disciples” and
is the aorist active imperative of <span lang=EL>μαθητευ</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(mathēteuō) which means to teach, to instruct them in evangelism. This is a
teacher teaching a learner, an unbeliever who is positive. “Baptizing them” is
the present active participle of <span lang=EL>βαπτι</span>́<span lang=EL>ζω</span>
(baptizō) and means to perform emersion baptism of the converts which as an
outward ritual that depicts the salvation in Jesus Christ by faith that has
already occurred. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, &quot;All
authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. &quot;Go therefore and
make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and
the Son and the Holy Spirit,” (Matthew 28:18-19, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 28:20, the command is given to teach the
believer who is positive. This is the command to the pastor-teacher. He is to teach
on a daily basis (not commanded). He is to categorize the Word of God in his
studies. He is commanded to study the whole counsel of the Word of God. </p>

<p class=Verses>“teaching them to observe all that I commanded you; and lo, I
am with you always, even to the end of the age.&quot;” (Matthew 28:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“To the end of the age” refers to the crash program of
teaching Bible doctrine for them in the 40 days prior to the Day of Pentecost and
the crash program of teaching Bible doctrine to the remnant of Israel (believers)
during the Tribulation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Book of John Emphasis</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Not only did Peter need to understand the place of divine
enablement in the sense of spiritual gifts, but he needed a strong personal love
for Jesus Christ. In John 21:15, our Lord asks Simon Peter whether he has a
mental attitude love <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>γαπα</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (agapaō) toward Him. He answered, “Yes, Lord; You know that I
love <span lang=EL>φιλε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (phileō) You.” Our
Lord’s command was to “Tend My lambs.” This refers to teaching the new immature
(babe) believers in basic Bible doctrine. </p>

<p class=Verses>“So when they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon
Peter, &quot;Simon, son of John, do you love Me more than these?&quot; He said
to Him, &quot;Yes, Lord; You know that I love You.&quot; He said to him,
&quot;Tend My lambs.&quot;” (John 21:15, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 21:16, our Lord asks Simon Peter a second time whether
he has a mental attitude love <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>γαπα</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (agapaō) toward Him. He answered, “Yes, Lord; You know that I
love <span lang=EL>φιλε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (phileō) You.” Our
Lord’s command was to “Shepherd My sheep.” This refers to feeding the growing,
yet somewhat immature (adolescent) believers in basic and some advanced Bible
doctrine.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He said to him again a second time, &quot;Simon, son of John,
do you love Me?&quot; He said to Him, &quot;Yes, Lord; You know that I love
You.&quot; He said to him, &quot;Shepherd My sheep.&quot;” (John 21:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 21:17, our Lord asks Simon Peter a third time
whether he has a personal love <span lang=EL>φιλε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(phileō) toward Him. He answered, “Lord, You know all things; You know that I
love <span lang=EL>φιλε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (phileō) You.” Our
Lord’s command was to “Tend My sheep.” “Tend” is <span lang=EL>βο</span>́<span
lang=EL>σκω</span> (boskō) and means to promote by teaching in every way the
spiritual welfare of the more mature (adult) believers in advanced Bible
doctrine.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He said to him the third time, &quot;Simon, son of John, do
you love Me?&quot; Peter was grieved because He said to him the third time,
&quot;Do you love Me?&quot; And he said to Him, &quot;Lord, You know all
things; You know that I love You.&quot; Jesus said to him, &quot;Tend My
sheep.” (John 21:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Book of Luke Emphasis</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 24:25, our Lord’s post-resurrection ministry to
His disciples was for them to stop being foolish and sluggish in their souls. The
Chief Shepherd was giving the face to face teaching. “Believe in all” refers to
the whole counsel of the Word of God.</p>

<p class=Verses> “And He said to them, &quot;O foolish men and slow of heart to
believe in all that the prophets have spoken!” (Luke 24:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 24:27, “He explained” is the aorist active
indicative of <span lang=EL>διερμηνευ</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(diermēneuō) and means to fully, intensively teach or expound. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then beginning with Moses and with all the prophets, He
explained to them the things concerning Himself in all the Scriptures.” (Luke
24:27, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 24:31, “their eyes were opened” is <span lang=EL>διανοι</span>́<span
lang=EL>γω</span><span lang=EL> </span>(dianoigō) and means to open as a gate,
to open the mind of one, to cause to understand a thing, to open one’s soul, to
rouse in one the faculty of understanding or the desire of learning. The true
Person of Jesus Christ was unknown to them prior to this teaching and then our
Lord vanished from their sight. Our Lord wanted to make more advanced Bible
doctrine the issue.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then their eyes were opened and they recognized Him; and He
vanished from their sight.” (Luke 24:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 24:32, “Were not our hearts burning within us” is
the present passive participle of <span lang=EL>και</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(kaiō) and means to receive light, to be put on fire by Bible doctrine. “He
was explaining” means our Lord was teaching them intensively and they had a
reaction to what was being taught.</p>

<p class=Verses>“They said to one another, &quot;Were not our hearts burning
within us while He was speaking to us on the road, while He was explaining the
Scriptures to us?&quot;” (Luke 24:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 24:45, we find the results of our Lord’s intense
teaching. “He opened their minds” is again <span lang=EL>διανοι</span>́<span
lang=EL>γω</span> (dianoigō) and means to open as a gate, to open the mind of
one, to cause to understand a thing, to open one’s soul. “To understand” is the
present active infinitive of <span lang=EL>συνι</span>́<span lang=EL>ημι</span>
(suniēmi) and means to bring many passages of Scripture together, to give a
frame of reference. No believer gets their completed edification complex
without a frame of reference of <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine. The disciples
just couldn’t put it all together without His teaching. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures,”
(Luke 24:45, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 24:49, “clothed with power from on high” refers
to the indwelling of God the Holy Spirit that would occur on the Day of
Pentecost. They would then receive spiritual gifts, one of them being tongues. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;And behold, I am sending forth the promise of My Father
upon you; but you are to stay in the city until you are clothed with power from
on high.&quot;” (Luke 24:49, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 24:51, “While He was blessing them” means to
cause to prosper, to make happy.</p>

<p class=Verses>“While He was blessing them, He parted from them and was
carried up into heaven.” (Luke 24:51, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 24:52-53, “with great joy” is <span lang=EL>μετα</span>́
<span lang=EL>χαρα</span>́ <span lang=EL>με</span>́<span lang=EL>γας</span>
(meta chara megas) and means great inner happiness – the happiness of God. They
expressed it collectively. The status quo was the expression of great joy. This
was directed toward God the Father.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And they, after worshiping Him, returned to Jerusalem with
great joy, and were continually in the temple praising God.” (Luke 24:52-53,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Christ did it on a face to face basis! Hence, Peter on
the Day of Pentecost was ready to minister.</p>
