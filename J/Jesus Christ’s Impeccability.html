<h2>Jesus Christ’s Impeccability</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The deity of Jesus Christ is eternally impeccable
(sinless). Jesus Christ in His deity was unable to sin because God cannot sin.
Psalms 145:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD is righteous in all His ways And kind in all His
deeds.”  (Psalms 145:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The humanity of Christ also remained impeccable while on
earth. 1 John 3:5; 2 Cor. 5:21; Heb. 4:15; 1 Peter 2:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“You know that He appeared in order to take away sins; and in
Him there is no sin.”  (1 John 3:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that
we might become the righteousness of God in Him.”  (2 Corinthians 5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with
our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet
without sin.”  (Hebrews 4:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“WHO COMMITTED NO SIN, NOR WAS ANY DECEIT FOUND IN HIS MOUTH;” 
(1 Peter 2:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus was born spiritually alive and without a sin nature
because of the virgin birth, thus Adam’s original sin could not be imputed to
Him as there was no target. 1 Cor. 15:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made
alive.”  (1 Corinthians 15:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Adam was the first man created without a sin nature. The
humanity of Jesus Christ was the only man born without a sin nature. Jesus
Christ was never commanded to be filled with the Holy Spirit. He was always
filled with the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit was given without measure to Him.
John 3:34.</p>

<p class=Verses>““For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for He
gives the Spirit without measure.”  (John 3:34, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ’s humanity was able not to sin because He
was always filled with the Holy Spirit. His human volition was always positive
and He chose not to ever sin regardless of the circumstances. He remained
impeccable to the Cross even through the trials where they beat and tortured
Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As true humanity, He walked as a man, He was sustain by
the Holy Spirit, His humanity always retained His perfect righteousness (+R),
He fulfilled the Mosaic Law, and He revealed the deity of God to the human
race. </p>
