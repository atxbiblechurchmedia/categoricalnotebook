<h2>Jesus Christ, Three Miracles Following His Physical Death</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Immediately following the physical death of the humanity
of our Lord, God caused the veil of the temple to be torn in two from top to
bottom. The substitutionary spiritual death of Jesus Christ on the Cross had
atoned for the sins of mankind. The sin barrier between God and man had been
removed. Only then did God tear the veil in two from top to bottom. Matt.
27:50-51.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and yielded up
His spirit. And behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to
bottom; and the earth shook and the rocks were split.” (Matthew 27:50-51, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The veil or curtain symbolized the separation between God
and man. Only the high priest and a direct descendant of Aaron could walk
through the veil or curtain on the Day of Atonement to sprinkle the blood of
the atoning animal sacrifice on the Mercy Seat. God Himself split the veil to
convey the new reality of the removal of the sin barrier. Jesus Christ had
provided the means for man’s access to God through faith in that atoning work. Heb.
10:19-20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, brethren, since we have confidence to enter the
holy place by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way which He inaugurated
for us through the veil, that is, His flesh,” (Hebrews 10:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This second miracle was so great an earthquake that the
rocks were literally split in two.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to
bottom; and the earth shook and the rocks were split.” (Matthew 27:51, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 27:52-53, “saints who had fallen asleep”
refers to believers who had previously died physically. “Were raised” means
they had been resuscitated. This were not Old Testament saints being
resurrected. Christ Himself had not yet ascended into heaven and He would be
the first fruits in entering heaven. 1 Cor. 15:20-23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits
of those who are asleep. For since “The tombs were opened, and many bodies of
the saints who had fallen asleep were raised; and coming out of the tombs after
His resurrection they entered the holy city and appeared to many.” (Matthew
27:52-53, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>by a man came death, by a man also came the resurrection of the
dead. For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive. But
each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, after that those who are
Christ's at His coming,” (1 Corinthians 15:20-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They were resuscitated for several reasons. The
tremendous power of God exercised in resurrection brought believers out of the
lower part of the earth. The purpose of bringing them back from the dead was a
crash program of witnessing. This was necessary because all the disciples, except
John, were in hiding. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The results of these miracles was salvation of many. For
example, the salvation of the centurion and those with him in Matthew 27:54.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now the centurion, and those who were with him keeping guard
over Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the things that were happening,
became very frightened and said, &quot;Truly this was the Son of God!&quot;”
(Matthew 27:54, NASB)</p>
