<h2><a name="_D-Judgment_Seat_of"></a><a name="_Judgment_Seat_of"></a>Judgment
Seat of Christ </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Church Age believer’s evaluation by Jesus Christ of
their production while on earth will take place at the Judgment Seat of Christ
immediately following the Rapture of the Church. The Judgment Seat of Christ is
often called the <span lang=EL>βη</span>͂<span lang=EL>μα</span> (bēma) from
the Greek, which means the official seat of a judge. The Judgment Seat of
Christ is only for Church Age believers. Rom. 14:10. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But you, why do you judge your brother? Or you again, why
do you regard your brother with contempt? For we will all stand before the
judgment seat of God.&quot;  (Romans 14:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In context, this refers to a brother, which is a believer
in the Church Age. The Judgment Seat of Christ is not the same as the Great
White Throne Judgment also called the Last Judgment, which is only for
unbelievers from all of human history and will take place 1,000 literal years
later at the end of the Millennium. Rev. 20:11-15.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat upon it,
from whose presence earth and heaven fled away, and no place was found for
them. And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne,
and books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life;
and the dead were judged from the things which were written in the books,
according to their deeds. And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and
death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged,
every one of them according to their deeds. Then death and Hades were thrown
into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire. And if
anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the
lake of fire.&quot;  (Revelation 20:11-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Judgment Seat of Christ is for all Church Age
believers carnal or spiritual. Therefore, all believers meet the Lord in the
air at the Rapture whether or not they are in fellowship. 2 Cor. 5:10; 1 Cor.
3:12-15.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For we must all appear before the judgment seat of
Christ, so that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body,
according to what he has done, whether good or bad.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 5:10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold,
silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, each man's work will become evident;
for the day will show it because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire
itself will test the quality of each man's work. If any man's work which he has
built on it remains, he will receive a reward. If any man's work is burned up,
he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through
fire.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 3:12-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Judgment Seat of Christ takes place in heaven
immediately after the Rapture while the literal 7-year Tribulation is occurring
on earth. The bride must be prepared for the groom. As indicated in the diagram
below, the Judgment Seat of Christ has to be between the Rapture and the Second
Advent because the Church returns with Christ as the “Bride of Christ” cleansed
of the sin nature and human good. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><img width=520 height=250 id="Picture 1"
src="Judgment%20Seat%20of%20Christ.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Armies of elect angels and Church Age believers will
return with our Lord at His Second Advent. Col. 3:4; Jude 1:14; 1 Thess. 3:13;
Zech. 14:5; Rev. 19:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And the armies which are in heaven, clothed in fine
linen, white and clean, were following Him on white horses.&quot;  (Revelation
19:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When Christ, who is our life, is revealed, then you also
will be revealed with Him in glory.&quot;  (Colossians 3:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;It was also about these men that Enoch, in the seventh
generation from Adam, prophesied, saying, &quot;Behold, the Lord came with many
thousands of His holy ones,&quot;  (Jude 1:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;so that He may establish your hearts without blame in
holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all His
saints.&quot;  (1 Thessalonians 3:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;You will flee by the valley of My mountains, for the
valley of the mountains will reach to Azel; yes, you will flee just as you fled
before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the LORD, my
God, will come, and all the holy ones with Him!&quot;  (Zechariah 14:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the armies which are in heaven, clothed in fine linen,
white and clean, were following Him on white horses.” (Revelation 19:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Preparation of the Bride</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>On earth, the Church is called the Body of Christ. In
heaven, the Church will be called the Bride of Christ. 1 Cor. 12:12. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For even as the body is one and yet has many members, and
all the members of the body, though they are many, are one body, so also is
Christ.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 12:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Body of Christ is growing and being completed during
the Church Age. Eph. 1:21-22; 1 Cor. 3:9; Matt. 16:18; Acts 2:47. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;far above all rule and authority and power and dominion,
and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come.
And He put all things in subjection under His feet, and gave Him as head over
all things to the church,&quot;  (Ephesians 1:21-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For we are God's fellow workers; you are God's field,
God's building.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 3:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this
rock I will build My church; and the gates of Hades will not overpower
it.&quot;  (Matthew 16:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;praising God and having favor with all the people. And
the Lord was adding to their number day by day those who were being
saved.&quot;  (Acts 2:47, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Members of the Body of Christ have different
responsibilities because of their spiritual gifts conveyed by the Holy Spirit
to every believer at the moment of salvation. Rom. 12:4-8; 1 Cor. 12:11-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For just as we have many members in one body and all the
members do not have the same function,&quot;  (Romans 12:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But one and the same Spirit works all these things,
distributing to each one individually just as He wills. For even as the body is
one and yet has many members, and all the members of the body, though they are
many, are one body, so also is Christ.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 12:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Church will be called the Bride of Christ in heaven
and undergoes preparation during the seven years of the Tribulation on earth.
Emphasis while in heaven is on preparation and display. This preparation is
three-fold. At the Rapture, all Church Age believers will receive a
resurrection body minus the old sin nature. 1 Cor. 15:51-57; 1 John 3:1-2;
Phil. 3:21; 1 Thess. 4:16-18. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Behold, I tell you a mystery; we will not all sleep, but we
will all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last
trumpet; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable,
and we will be changed. For this perishable must put on the imperishable, and
this mortal must put on immortality. But when this perishable will have put on
the imperishable, and this mortal will have put on immortality, then will come
about the saying that is written, &quot;DEATH IS SWALLOWED UP in victory.
&quot;O DEATH, WHERE IS YOUR VICTORY? O DEATH, WHERE IS YOUR STING?&quot; The
sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law; but thanks be to God,
who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.” (1 Corinthians
15:51-57, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“See how great a love the Father has bestowed on us, that we
would be called children of God; and such we are. For this reason the world
does not know us, because it did not know Him. Beloved, now we are children of
God, and it has not appeared as yet what we will be. We know that when He
appears, we will be like Him, because we will see Him just as He is.” (1 John
3:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“who will transform the body of our humble state into
conformity with the body of His glory, by the exertion of the power that He has
even to subject all things to Himself.” (Philippians 3:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout,
with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in
Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up
together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we shall
always be with the Lord. Therefore comfort one another with these words.” (1
Thessalonians 4:16-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Just as the Lord Jesus Christ did not have an old sin
nature, the believer in resurrection body will no longer have an old sin nature.
2 Cor. 5:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so
that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.&quot;  (2 Corinthians
5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All human good is removed from the Bride. Believers are
cleansed or liberated from human good so they won’t be embarrassed. 1 Cor.
3:12-15.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold,
silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, each man's work will become evident;
for the day will show it because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire
itself will test the quality of each man's work. If any man's work which he has
built on it remains, he will receive a reward. If any man's work is burned up,
he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through
fire.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 3:12-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When the Bride of Christ returns with Christ, no Church
Age believer in resurrection body will have an old sin nature. They will never
again perform human good or be able to sin. They will come back to reign with
Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It will take seven years to burn away the human good. God
deals with individuals, not with the masses. Couple this with the fact that He
bore individual sins on the Cross and one concludes that He probably deals
individually with rewards.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Church Age Believer’s Evaluation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Judgment Seat of Christ is one of seven evaluations
or judgments. The Judgment Seat of Christ is the place of evaluation of the
believer’s production. 2 Cor. 5:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For we must all appear before the judgment seat of
Christ, so that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body,
according to what he has done, whether good or bad.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 5:10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The only acceptable foundation of divine good on which
the believer can build is the Lord Jesus Christ, our position in Christ. 1 Cor.
3:10-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;According to the grace of God which was given to me, like
a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another is building on it. But
each man must be careful how he builds on it. For no man can lay a foundation
other than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.&quot;  (1 Corinthians
3:10-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divine good can only be done via filling of the Holy
Spirit and is called gold, silver, and precious stones in 1 Corinthians
3:12-15. These building materials have to be divine viewpoint building
materials.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold,
silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, each man's work will become evident;
for the day will show it because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire
itself will test the quality of each man's work. If any man's work which he has
built on it remains, he will receive a reward. If any man's work is burned up,
he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through
fire.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 3:12-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Gold speaks of deity. Anything in your life that is
glorifying to God including the faith-rest life, functioning in the spiritual
life, the erection of the edification complex of the soul, and application of <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine to life’s situations and challenges is considered by Jesus
Christ to be divine good. Silver speaks of redemption and witnessing in the
power of the Lord Jesus Christ. Precious stones are used to adorn and represent
the fruit of the Spirit or manifestation of the Spirit-filled life of love,
joy, peace, etc. Gal. 5:22-23. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,
patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against
such things there is no law.&quot;  (Galatians 5:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Human good is produced while controlled by the old sin
nature and is called wood, hay, and straw. Building materials made of human
good production will be burned away as completely unacceptable to God. Wood can
be beautiful, but will not stand up under fire. This represents any activity in
the energy of the flesh where the soul is controlled by the old sin nature and glorifies
self. Hay is used to feed animals, so it is good, but burnable. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Any activity done in the energy of the flesh (out of
fellowship) is human good and unacceptable to God. For example, if you witness
for Christ in the energy of the flesh, it is human good even if the person
becomes saved. Only work done while your soul is controlled by the Holy Spirit
is acceptable as divine good. Straw represents good things that people do out
of spite, envy, or hostility. People try to get even with people by doing good
little things, as well as bad things.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Fire will be the tester. Only divine good production will
stand. All carnal good works will be burned. Thus everything done in the power
of the Holy Spirit will be rewarded. Our evaluation will be based on divine
norms and standards. False motivation destroys any possibility of rewards. When
you really understand grace, you will not be thinking of rewards, but will
receive them nonetheless. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Rewards &amp; Crowns</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Anything we know about rewards is provided in
generalities in Scripture, such as crowns and accolades. Rewards can be likened
to a Thanksgiving dinner. Each eats a different amount, but each is satisfied.
There will be no old sin natures in heaven with their lust patterns.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There will be differences in heaven, but they will be a
matter of responsibility comparable to our spiritual gifts in the Church Age. The
Church has a universal priesthood will have a heavenly kingdom.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Church Age believers are placed into union with Jesus
Christ at salvation. Their eternal abode will be the New Heavens - in charge of
galaxies, celestial bodies, heavens etc. The New Jerusalem will be the
administrative center and since the Bride is one with the Lord Jesus Christ,
much time will be spent there. This place is being prepared. John 14:1-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;Do not let your heart be troubled; believe in God,
believe also in Me. &quot;In My Father's house are many dwelling places; if it
were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you.
&quot;If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to
Myself, that where I am, there you may be also. &quot;  (John 14:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Israel will have an earthly kingdom and a specialized
priesthood. Their eternal abode will be the New Earth. See category on <a
