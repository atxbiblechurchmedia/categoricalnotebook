<h2>Jesus Christ, Qualifications to be Savior </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ was perfectly qualified to be the Savior of
mankind. Jesus Christ was qualified by prophecy. He was qualified by lineage or
genealogy. Matt. 1; Luke 3. He was qualified by the Davidic Covenant (house,
kingdom, throne). 2 Sam. 7; Luke 1. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>He was qualified by His ascension
and His current session where He was told by God the Father to “sit down” at
the Father’s right hand – the place of honor. Heb. 1. He was qualified by being
the perfect God-man. John 1:1-14. He was qualified because He was the perfect
genius with the perfect spiritual IQ. 1 Cor. 1 and 2.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>Adam was created innocent. He then
sinned through negative volition and he died spiritually. He then acquired an
old sin nature which became the source of his personal sin. Since Adam, every
member of the human race is born into the world with a genetically-formed sin
nature to which God the Father imputes Adam’s original sin at the first breath,
thus we are all born physically alive and spiritually dead. Further, we all sin
in our lifetime and have no way to gain the absolute righteousness of God. We
are all born in the slave market of sin. Rom. 5:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world,
and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned—”
(Romans 5:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To become our Savior, the Son of God took on the form of
true humanity to become the unique God-man in one person forever. He became
“flesh.” Heb. 2:14-16; Phil. 2:6-8; John 1:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood, He
Himself likewise also partook of the same, that through death He might render
powerless him who had the power of death, that is, the devil, and might free
those who through fear of death were subject to slavery all their lives. For
assuredly He does not give help to angels, but He gives help to the descendant
of Abraham.” (Hebrews 2:14-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard
equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form
of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men. Being found in
appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of
death, even death on a cross.” (Philippians 2:6-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw His
glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.”
(John 1:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ, in His humanity, was qualified to be our
Savior because He had no imputed or inherent old sin nature. He committed no
personal sin throughout His life, even while being crucified. 2 Cor. 5:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that
we might become the righteousness of God in Him.” (2 Corinthians 5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ was qualified to be our Savior through the
virgin birth. He came into the world as a free man. The sin of Adam was not
imputed to Him. He did not inherit an old sin nature and He did not committed
any personal sins. He became the unique person of the universe – perfect God
and sinless man – the God-man.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He was qualified to and did die with reference to the old
sin nature, condemning it. He was qualified to and did endure the divine
judgment for the sins produced by all of mankind.  He also rejected the human
good which comes from the area of strength in the old sin nature. Titus 3:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done in
righteousness, but according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration and
renewing by the Holy Spirit,” (Titus 3:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He died spiritually so that we might have eternal life.
He died physically so that we might have a resurrection body. 1 John 5:11-12;
Rom. 4:25.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the testimony is this, that God has given us eternal life,
and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has the life; he who does not
have the Son of God does not have the life.” (1 John 5:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He who was delivered over because of our transgressions, and
was raised because of our justification.” (Romans 4:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Jesus Christ is Qualified to be Our Savior by Prophecy
</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The diagram below summarizes the Old Testament prophecies
regarding the qualifications of Jesus Christ to be our Savior. Note how the
prophecies narrow down the potential One who would die on the Cross. He would
be of the human race, of the nation of Israel, of the Tribe of Judah, a Prophet
like unto Moses, a King like unto David, His Birthplace would be Bethlehem, His
birth would be of a virgin, His names among others are Wonderful Counsellor,
the mighty God, the everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace and finally He
would die on a Cross. Thus He is the ONLY ONE qualified to be our Savior.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><img width=550 height=300 id="Picture 1"
src="Jesus%20Christ,%20Qualifications%20to%20be%20Savior.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>His race was predicted. He became a member of the human
race. In Genesis 3:15, “you” refers to Satan, the “woman” refers to Eve, “your
seed” refers to Satan’s seed, “her seed” refers to Jesus Christ, “He” is Jesus
Christ, the “head” is Satan’s head, and “bruise him on the heel” refers to the
Cross where Jesus Christ would atone for all sins. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And I will put enmity Between you and the woman, And between
your seed and her seed; He shall bruise you on the head, And you shall bruise
him on the heel.&quot;” (Genesis 3:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>His nation was predicted as Israel, a nation founded on
regeneration. Abraham, Isaac, Jacob were all believers. First, the Savior would
come through the human race. Second, the Savior would come through the nation of
Israel. Prophecy narrowed down the identity of the Savior. Gen. 12:1-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now the LORD said to Abram, &quot;Go forth from your country,
And from your relatives And from your father's house, To the land which I will
show you; And I will make you a great nation, And I will bless you, And make
your name great; And so you shall be a blessing; And I will bless those who
bless you, And the one who curses you I will curse. And in you all the families
of the earth will be blessed.&quot;” (Genesis 12:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>His tribe was predicted as Judah. He was known in the Old
Testament as the Lion of the tribe of Judah. We move from the general category
of homo sapiens to a more specific category, a nation, namely Israel. And
finally to a category within that nation, Judah. Gen. 49:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;The scepter shall not depart from Judah, Nor the ruler's
staff from between his feet, Until Shiloh comes, And to him shall be the
obedience of the peoples.” (Genesis 49:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>His prophetic office was predicted by Moses. The
qualified Savior would be a prophet like unto Moses. Moses was marvelous, but One
greater than Moses was in the offing. Deut. 18:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like
me from among you, from your countrymen, you shall listen to him.” (Deuteronomy
18:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>His kingship was predicted. Through the line of David, He
would have a house. He would have a throne. He would have a kingdom. 2 Sam.
7:14-16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I will be a father to him and he will be a son to Me;
when he commits iniquity, I will correct him with the rod of men and the
strokes of the sons of men, but My lovingkindness shall not depart from him, as
I took it away from Saul, whom I removed from before you. &quot;Your house and
your kingdom shall endure before Me forever; your throne shall be established
forever.&quot;'&quot;” (2 Samuel 7:14-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>His birthplace was predicted. Bethlehem Ephrathah, a
specific location prophesied in 710 BC. Micah 5:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But as for you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, Too little to be
among the clans of Judah, From you One will go forth for Me to be ruler in
Israel. His goings forth are from long ago, From the days of eternity.&quot;”
(Micah 5:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>His unique virgin birth was predicted. Isaiah 7:14. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold,
a virgin will be with child and bear a son, and she will call His name
Immanuel.” (Isaiah 7:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Many of His names were predicted. Isaiah 9:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us; And
the government will rest on His shoulders; And His name will be called
Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.” (Isaiah 9:6,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>His death on the Cross was predicted. Isaiah 53. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Thus, the One born in the Gospels could be none other
than the Lord Jesus Christ. He was born so that He could die spiritually on our
behalf and physically for all believers. In His death, He rose again. Today we
worship Him as the ascended seated Christ. Do you know Him, believe in Him?</p>
