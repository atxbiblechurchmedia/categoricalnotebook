<h2><a name="_D-Justification"></a><a name="_Justification"></a>Justification</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Barrier</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A barrier exists between the character of man in relative
righteousness (-R) and God’s absolute righteousness (+R). Our iniquities have
separated us from God. Isaiah 59:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But your iniquities have made a separation between you and
your God, And your sins have hidden His face from you so that He does not
hear.”  (Isaiah 59:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s viewpoint of man is expressed in Romans 3:10-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“as it is written, “THERE IS NONE RIGHTEOUS, NOT EVEN ONE;
THERE IS NONE WHO UNDERSTANDS, THERE IS NONE WHO SEEKS FOR GOD; ALL HAVE TURNED
ASIDE, TOGETHER THEY HAVE BECOME USELESS; THERE IS NONE WHO DOES GOOD, THERE IS
NOT EVEN ONE.”“  (Romans 3:10-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s viewpoint of the best that man can produce in his
own power, intellect, and abilities is expressed in Isaiah 64:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For all of us have become like one who is unclean, And all our
righteous deeds are like a filthy garment; And all of us wither like a leaf,
And our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.”  (Isaiah 64:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Work of Christ: Justification </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Justification is defined as the remission of sin and
absolution from guilt and punishment. An act of grace by which God pardons the
sinner and accepts Him as righteous because of the unlimited atonement of
Christ on the Cross. Because God the Father was satisfied (Propitiation), we
are freely justified (Justification). Rom. 3:24; Rom. 5:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“being justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption
which is in Christ Jesus;”  (Romans 3:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with
God through our Lord Jesus Christ,”  (Romans 5:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Justification occurs for every believer at the instant of
salvation. Justification is another way of describing our salvation
relationship with God. It occurs in three logical steps. Once the Gospel is
understood and believed through personal faith alone in Christ alone, the
justice of God gives or imputes His very own perfect righteousness (+R) to us
forever. This is for all who believe in Christ - no exceptions. Because we have
His own perfect righteousness, God judicially pronounces us justified and officially
righteous. God is then free to give each believer eternal life at the same
instant that justification was declared.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>After salvation, your outward divine good production as a
believer vindicates or justifies you and your stand for Christ in the eyes of
the unbeliever. The Book of James is the view of the believer as seen from the
eyes of the unbeliever.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Work of Christ: Imputation </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Imputation is defined as the charging to the account of
one, something which properly belonged to another. God the Father imputes His
very own perfect righteousness (+R) to the believer at salvation. We share the
perfect righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ when the Holy Spirit places un
into union with Him at salvation. This is the believer’s double perfect
righteousness – all via God’s grace.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Man with relative righteousness meets God with perfect
absolute righteousness at the Cross and God imputes to man his very own perfect
absolute righteousness. Rom. 3:22; 2 Cor. 5:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ
for all those who believe; for there is no distinction;”  (Romans 3:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that
we might become the righteousness of God in Him.”  (2 Corinthians 5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Because absolute righteousness (+R) is imputed, God calls
us justified. Imputation of +R on the basis of faith alone in Jesus Christ
alone = justification. Until God imputes or conveys His perfect righteousness,
there can be no justification. We can never be justified until we first receive
perfect righteousness. All human categories of righteousness are unacceptable per
Isaiah 64:6. This verse makes it very clear that God doesn't think much of your
best efforts to do “good” things to earn the right to have an eternal
relationship with Him. There is nothing we can do to earn it! Justification
cannot occur by being good or obeying the Mosaic law. Gal. 2:16; Rom. 3:28.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For all of us have become like one who is unclean, And
all our righteous deeds are like a filthy garment; And all of us wither like a
leaf, And our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.&quot;  (Isaiah 64:6,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;nevertheless knowing that a man is not justified by the
works of the Law but through faith in Christ Jesus, even we have believed in
Christ Jesus, so that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the
works of the Law; since by the works of the Law no flesh will be
justified.&quot;  (Galatians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart
from works of the Law.&quot;  (Romans 3:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Justification is based solely on the grace of God. The
only thing we can do is have faith alone in Christ alone for salvation. Perfect
righteousness is the only thing we have that counts with God. Justification
resolves mankind’s problem of being able to achieve only a relative
righteousness through works which will never result in eternal life with God. Eph.
2:8-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that
not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no
one may boast.&quot;  (Ephesians 2:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is justified in conveying His perfect righteousness
to each believer at the point of faith belief in the substitutionary work of
Jesus Christ on the Cross. The result is that God declares the believer
righteous. Rom. 3:26-28.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;for the demonstration, I say, of His righteousness at the
present time, so that He would be just and the justifier of the one who has
faith in Jesus. Where then is boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? Of
works? No, but by a law of faith. For we maintain that a man is justified by
faith apart from works of the Law.&quot;  (Romans 3:26-28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><a name="_Justification_By_Faith"></a><b>Justification By
Faith Alone, Not Works</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For justification to occur, it requires something from
man and something from God. Faith belief is required on the part of each person
to be saved which is purely a non-meritorious function. There is no merit or
credit for anything on the part of the one believing. They just have to
believe. Nothing more! Adding anything to this simple faith belief cancels the
faith and salvation will not occur for that person. Justification also involves
God the Father judging all of our sins on the Cross resulting in the substitutionary
spiritual death of Christ on the Cross. When we believe, God must also impute
or convey His perfect righteousness to each of us, so that by recognizing His
perfect righteousness in us, He justifies us. Rom. 3:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;because by the works of the Law no flesh will be
justified in His sight; for through the Law comes the knowledge of sin.&quot; 
(Romans 3:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Romans 4:4-5 tells us that the person who works for
salvation receives nothing from God because the justice of God is not free to
give him anything. Instead their works are credited to them as debt. This is
because God’s perfect righteousness cannot ever be imputed to anyone apart of
faith alone in Christ alone for salvation. Imputed perfect righteousness comes
through grace, not human merit. This principle is also illustrated in Romans
9:30-32, Romans 3:24, and Titus 3:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now to the one who works, his wage is not credited as a
favor, but as what is due. But to the one who does not work, but believes in
Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness,&quot; 
(Romans 4:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;What shall we say then? That Gentiles, who did not pursue
righteousness, attained righteousness, even the righteousness which is by
faith; but Israel, pursuing a law of righteousness, did not arrive at that law.
Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as though it were by works.
They stumbled over the stumbling stone,&quot;  (Romans 9:30-32, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;being justified as a gift by His grace through the
redemption which is in Christ Jesus;&quot;  (Romans 3:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;so that being justified by His grace we would be made
heirs according to the hope of eternal life.&quot;  (Titus 3:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is a true brotherhood among believers only.
However, the brotherhood of man might be better termed the brotherhood of
sinners. Rom. 3:21-23.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But now apart from the Law the righteousness of God has
been manifested, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets, even the
righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all those who believe;
for there is no distinction; for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of
God,&quot;  (Romans 3:21-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>By using the ceiling as an illustration, let’s use that
as God’s standard of glory. So, I stretch and stretch to the top of the
ceiling, but I’m too short. I don’t measure up! Even so, man comes short of the
glory of God. If God’s standard of glory were the width of the Mississippi
River at St. Louis, jumping across cannot be accomplished by anyone. All people
living in St. Louis could try to jump it. Some would jump farther than others,
but they all come far short of the opposite shore. A third illustration could
be Pike’s Peak where I may be closer to heaven when I stand on Pike’s Peak
compared to standing on the shore of the Pacific, but I still am far short of
touching heaven with my fingertips. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What is the difference between the righteousness of Adolf
Eichmann and Mary Jones? Just a matter of relative righteousness. Both came
short of His glory. Glory is the outshining of His attributes. Man in
desperation grabs for the Law like it was a life raft. Instead of this, it
proves to be a rock, pulling him under. To grab the Law as a savior, is like
grabbing a sack of cement instead of a parachute when you are jumping out of a
doomed aircraft. The Law was actually given to point out sin! Actually all heresy
or apostacy has its source in wrong or feeble conceptions of sin. Rom. 3:28.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart
from works of the Law.&quot;  (Romans 3:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Unitarianism calls sin a misfortune. Socialists call sin
wrong environment. Christian Scientists say sin does not exist. Spiritualists
admit there is sin, but do not believe in the punishment of sin. But the vast
majority of people in Christendom simply ignore sin. Remember, it is one thing
to recognize your sin. It is quite another thing to deal with it biblically.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What place does the Law have then? Are we to throw it
out? No, it is good. We are to establish it, to fulfill it. This is done by
realizing we are sinners as the Law points out and accepting Christ as Savior.
Then, as we are controlled by the filling of the  Holy Spirit, we fulfill the Law
as Christ did. Rom. 3:31.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Do we then nullify the Law through faith? May it never
be! On the contrary, we establish the Law.&quot;  (Romans 3:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Justice of God Involvement in Justification</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The function of the justice of God in justification is to
prevent any compromise of God’s perfect righteousness. The justice of God does
this by judging all sin. God the Father prepared a plan in eternity past to
deal with mankind’s sins through the saving work of Jesus Christ on the Cross.
Romans 4:25 and Romans 5:1 tell us that the love of God is never free to bless
mankind if there will be any compromise of God's perfect essence. By judging
all sins on the Cross (Unlimited Atonement), the justice of God is now free to
bless each person at the point of salvation faith belief. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; He who was delivered over because of our transgressions,
and was raised because of our justification.&quot;  (Romans 4:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace
with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,&quot;  (Romans 5:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The word “salvation” in the Bible means justification
because it reveals the source of the work as well as the mechanics involved.
God did all the work through His grace by imputing His perfect righteousness to
each of us at salvation. Christ was raised from the dead because of our
justification. There was no resurrection of the humanity of Jesus Christ until
God had done everything necessary to provide justification.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Romans 5:8-9 states that Jesus Christ died spiritually
for each of us. When we die physically, we only die for ourselves. When Jesus
Christ died spiritually on the Cross, He did so for every member of the human
race of His own volition and based on His unconditional love for us. His
substitutionary spiritual death was His salvation payment in full by being the
object of judgment of God the Father toward all of our sins.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that
while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, having now been
justified by His blood, we shall be saved from the wrath of God through
Him.&quot;  (Romans 5:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 5:8-9, the word “blood” emphasizes the total
work of Christ. Justification is the work of the integrity of God in providing
a relationship between man and God. “Blood” refers to redemption, propitiation,
and reconciliation as essential parts of our so great salvation. The justice of
God is never free to bless unless justice can keep the entire essence of God
from compromise. The justice of God had to judge our sins on the Cross before
the love of God would be free to bless us with salvation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Father has always loved God the Son. He continues
to also love the perfect and sinless humanity of Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is
the unique God-man with His perfect and absolute divine attributes completely
separate from His humanity - called the Hypostatic Union of Jesus Christ. Even
though God the Father’s love for the Son was absolute and perfect, once the
humanity of Jesus Christ agreed to accept the imputation of all of the sins of
the human race, God the Father had to judge those sins. This was the perfect
payment for all sin for all time. Jesus Christ died spiritually (His humanity
was separated from God the Father) when this payment time occurred. He was our
substitute. God the Father did the judging. The humanity of Jesus Christ received
the judgment. Now, God the Holy Spirit reveals the judgment to mankind. Rom.
8:32.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him over
for us all, how will He not also with Him freely give us all things?&quot; 
(Romans 8:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Justification is Related to Our Eternity With Jesus
Christ </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The justice of God had to first judge all of man’s sins
“at the proper time” by judging them all on the Cross through Christ’s
redemptive work. This had to be done before the love of God would be free to
send grace blessing to mankind. God’s work of justification was accomplished
through man’s faith alone in the work of Christ alone on the Cross - either
looking to the future for Old Testament believers or looking to the past for
Church Age believers. Christ has been resurrected from the dead. This fact now
links justification with the strategic victory of Christ in the Angelic
Conflict. 1 Tim. 2:5-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For there is one God, and one mediator also between God
and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave Himself as a ransom for all, the
testimony given at the proper time.&quot;  (1 Timothy 2:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The saving work of Jesus Christ on the Cross is our
Lord's humanity being judged by the justice of God for our sins. During our
Lord’s incarnation here on earth, Satan did everything in his power to destroy
the humanity of Christ through temptation, attempted assassination, and to keep
Him from reaching the Cross. All of Satan’s attempts failed completely. The
work of Christ on the Cross destroyed the works of the devil. 1 John 3:8. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;the one who practices sin is of the devil; for the devil
has sinned from the beginning. The Son of God appeared for this purpose, to
destroy the works of the devil.&quot;  (1 John 3:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The resurrection of Jesus Christ became the link between
the love of God being able to bless us through grace and His victory in the
Angelic Conflict on the Cross. The love or integrity of God saves us and
carries us all the way to glory. God's perfect righteousness is a down payment.
It is God's integrity that guarantees you a resurrection body. Rom. 4:25; Rom.
8:29-30.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; He who was delivered over because of our transgressions,
and was raised because of our justification.&quot;  (Romans 4:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become
conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many
brethren; and these whom He predestined, He also called; and these whom He
called, He also justified; and these whom He justified, He also
glorified.&quot;  (Romans 8:29-30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God guarantees each believer a resurrection body in
eternity that is exactly like His own. In addition, special blessings will be
conveyed to those who reach spiritual maturity and maximum glorification of
God. These blessings are above and beyond all that we could ever ask or dream
of. 1 Cor. 15:51-57, Phil. 3:21, 1 John 3:1-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Behold, I tell you a mystery; we will not all sleep, but
we will all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last
trumpet; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable,
and we will be changed. For this perishable must put on the imperishable, and
this mortal must put on immortality. But when this perishable will have put on
the imperishable, and this mortal will have put on immortality, then will come
about the saying that is written, &quot;DEATH IS SWALLOWED UP in victory.
&quot;O DEATH, WHERE IS YOUR VICTORY? O DEATH, WHERE IS YOUR STING?&quot; The
sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law; but thanks be to God,
who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.&quot;  (1 Corinthians
15:51-57, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;who will transform the body of our humble state into
conformity with the body of His glory, by the exertion of the power that He has
even to subject all things to Himself.&quot;  (Philippians 3:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;See how great a love the Father has bestowed on us, that
we would be called children of God; and such we are. For this reason the world
does not know us, because it did not know Him. Beloved, now we are children of
God, and it has not appeared as yet what we will be. We know that when He
appears, we will be like Him, because we will see Him just as He is. And
everyone who has this hope fixed on Him purifies himself, just as He is
pure.&quot;  (1 John 3:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Justification Illustrated</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Remember that Romans 4:1 was written to Gentiles. In what
sense could Abraham be a father to them? There is the natural seed of Abraham -
the Jews. In Romans 4:2, there is the spiritual seed of Abraham where any Jew
who has believed in Christ by faith as Abraham did is saved. Also, any Gentile
who has believed in Christ as Abraham did is saved.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather
according to the flesh, has found?&quot;  (Romans 4:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something
to boast about, but not before God.&quot;  (Romans 4:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Did Abraham try to justify himself by works? Yes, after
salvation, Abraham used works in the flesh. He fled to Egypt, taking Lot with
him and lied about his wife. Lot got a taste of city life in Egypt and wasted
his life in Sodom. Works in the flesh caused Ishmael to be born. This caused
only shame and confusion. In Romans 4:3, Abraham simply believed God! Abraham’s
faith was not an act of works, it was an attitude. Repentance is the mental
attitude involved in accepting Jesus Christ as Savior.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For what does the Scripture say? &quot;ABRAHAM BELIEVED
GOD, AND IT WAS CREDITED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS.&quot;&quot;  (Romans 4:3,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One who works is entitled to wages. Abraham, according to
Genesis 15:6, had believed (hiphil perfect, causative in the Hebrew) in Ur of
the Chaldees. He received salvation on the basis of grace as well as the
promises of land, seed, and blessing. Rom. 4:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then he believed in the LORD; and He reckoned it to him
as righteousness.&quot;  (Genesis 15:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now to the one who works, his wage is not credited as a
favor, but as what is due.&quot;  (Romans 4:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If a man does not work for something, then the only other
method of receiving it is by what? Yes, a gift! Salvation is a free gift. Rom.
4:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who
justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness,&quot;  (Romans
4:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The illustration of David is found in Romans 4:6-8. This
is quoted from Psalms 32:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;just as David also speaks of the blessing on the man to
whom God credits righteousness apart from works: &quot;BLESSED ARE THOSE WHOSE
LAWLESS DEEDS HAVE BEEN FORGIVEN, AND WHOSE SINS HAVE BEEN COVERED.
&quot;BLESSED IS THE MAN WHOSE SIN THE LORD WILL NOT TAKE INTO
ACCOUNT.&quot;&quot;  (Romans 4:6-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; A Psalm of David. A Maskil. How blessed is he whose
transgression is forgiven, Whose sin is covered! How blessed is the man to whom
the LORD does not impute iniquity, And in whose spirit there is no
deceit!&quot;  (Psalms 32:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>David was a great sinner and when he sinned with
Bathsheba, Nathan said in 2 Samuel 12:5-6 that David deserved to die. The Law
said David should die. There is chastisement or divine discipline under grace.
David had four of his children die. The child of Bathsheba, Ammon, Absalom and
Adonijah.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then David's anger burned greatly against the man, and he
said to Nathan, &quot;As the LORD lives, surely the man who has done this
deserves to die. &quot;He must make restitution for the lamb fourfold, because
he did this thing and had no compassion.&quot;&quot;  (2 Samuel 12:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Abraham was justified by faith, apart from any ritual or
ordinance. Suffice it to say here that circumcision didn’t save, baptism didn’t
save, church membership didn’t save, taking communion didn’t save and it
doesn’t now. Abraham was justified before the Law was given and before he was
circumcised. There was a time in Abraham’s life when by uncircumcision he
represented the Gentiles, as later after his circumcision he became the
representative of Israel. Rom. 4:9-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Is this blessing then on the circumcised, or on the
uncircumcised also? For we say, &quot;FAITH WAS CREDITED TO ABRAHAM AS
RIGHTEOUSNESS.&quot; How then was it credited? While he was circumcised, or
uncircumcised? Not while circumcised, but while uncircumcised; and he received
the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had
while uncircumcised, so that he might be the father of all who believe without
being circumcised, that righteousness might be credited to them, and the father
of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision, but who also
follow in the steps of the faith of our father Abraham which he had while
uncircumcised.&quot;  (Romans 4:9-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Romans 4:13-16 shows the difference between sin and
transgression. It may be wrong to drive 45 miles an hour through a certain
residential section, but it is not breaking the law until a 25 miles per hour
speed limit sign is installed. The Law makes what was sin, a transgression.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For the promise to Abraham or to his descendants that he
would be heir of the world was not through the Law, but through the
righteousness of faith. For if those who are of the Law are heirs, faith is
made void and the promise is nullified; for the Law brings about wrath, but
where there is no law, there also is no violation. For this reason it is by
faith, in order that it may be in accordance with grace, so that the promise
will be guaranteed to all the descendants, not only to those who are of the
Law, but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us
all,&quot;  (Romans 4:13-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Those out of all nations and tongues who exercise the
same living faith of Abraham are his heavenly seed. Rom. 4:17; Rom. 4:18-21; Rom.
4:22-24.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;(as it is written, &quot;A FATHER OF MANY NATIONS HAVE I
MADE YOU&quot;) in the presence of Him whom he believed, even God, who gives
life to the dead and calls into being that which does not exist.&quot;  (Romans
4:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;In hope against hope he believed, so that he might become
a father of many nations according to that which had been spoken, &quot;SO
SHALL YOUR DESCENDANTS BE.&quot; Without becoming weak in faith he contemplated
his own body, now as good as dead since he was about a hundred years old, and
the deadness of Sarah's womb; yet, with respect to the promise of God, he did
not waver in unbelief but grew strong in faith, giving glory to God, and being
fully assured that what God had promised, He was able also to perform.&quot;  (Romans
4:18-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore IT WAS ALSO CREDITED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS.
Now not for his sake only was it written that it was credited to him, but for
our sake also, to whom it will be credited, as those who believe in Him who
raised Jesus our Lord from the dead,&quot;  (Romans 4:22-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><a name="_Justification_By_Faith,"></a><a
name="_Benefits_of_Justification"></a><b>Justification Benefits</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Justification is defined as the judicial act of God
whereby He declares righteous the one who believed in Christ. The definition is
not just as if one had never sinned. We are justified because we have sinned. The
peace in Romans 5:1 is true peace. There is a false peace talked of by almost
everyone. Only Christ is the source of true peace. The peace here comes from
the knowledge of sins forgiven.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace
with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,&quot;  (Romans 5:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Access is provided in Romans 5:2. This is free admission.
Christ paid the price of admission. Faith is the ticket or passport to get us
in. Very few have access to the president of the U.S.A., but God has no
partiality in His access. “Hope of the glory of God” refers to the Rapture of
the Church. Very few talk about this in Christian circles today. Titus 2:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;through whom also we have obtained our introduction by
faith into this grace in which we stand; and we exult in hope of the glory of
God.&quot;  (Romans 5:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the
glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus,&quot;  (Titus 2:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Romans 5:3-4 says we triumph in troubles. Trouble and
trial are often the sandpaper to polish the spiritual life.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And not only this, but we also exult in our tribulations,
knowing that tribulation brings about perseverance; and perseverance, proven
character; and proven character, hope;&quot;  (Romans 5:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Romans 5:5 talks about the love of God. The fruit of the
Spirit is produced in our lives via the enabling power of the Holy Spirit. This
is the greatest exposition of love in the Bible.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has
been poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to
us.&quot;  (Romans 5:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Romans 5:9 says the believer is delivered from all
judgment of sin in the sense that they do not have to appear at the Great White
Throne or even go through the Tribulation. Believers are saved from God's wrath
and judgment through faith in Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Much more then, having now been justified by His blood,
we shall be saved from the wrath of God through Him.&quot;  (Romans 5:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Romans 5:10 presents our reconciliation that means that a
change takes place on the part of man at salvation. We were enemies and now we
are friends. Christ removed the barrier between God and man. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God
through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be
saved by His life.&quot;  (Romans 5:10, NASB)</p>
