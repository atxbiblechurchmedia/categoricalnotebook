<h2><a name="_Jesus_Christ,_The"></a>Jesus Christ, The Rock</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The term “Rock” is a title for Jesus Christ and designates
Christ’s person and work. Deut. 32:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>““The Rock! His work is perfect, For all His ways are just; A
God of faithfulness and without injustice, Righteous and upright is He.” 
(Deuteronomy 32:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Rock of Salvation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is the Rock of Salvation. Jesus Christ was
judged on the Cross by the justice of God the Father for the sins of mankind. Faith
alone in the work of Jesus Christ alone is the only way to salvation. Deut.
32:15; Psalms 27:5; 1 Cor. 10:4-5; John 4:13-14; John 7:37-39.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But Jeshurun grew fat and kicked— You are grown fat,
thick, and sleek— Then he forsook God who made him, And scorned the Rock of his
salvation.” (Deuteronomy 32:15, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“For in the day of trouble He will conceal me in His
tabernacle; In the secret place of His tent He will hide me; He will lift me up
on a rock.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 27:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and all drank the same spiritual drink, for they were drinking
from a spiritual rock which followed them; and the rock was Christ.
Nevertheless, with most of them God was not well-pleased; for they were laid
low in the wilderness.”  (1 Corinthians 10:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Jesus answered and said to her, “Everyone who drinks of this
water will thirst again; but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him
shall never thirst; but the water that I will give him will become in him a
well of water springing up to eternal life.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 4:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood
and cried out, saying, “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink. “He
who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, ‘From his innermost being will flow
rivers of living water.’“ But this He spoke of the Spirit, whom those who
believed in Him were to receive; for the Spirit was not yet given, because
Jesus was not yet glorified.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 7:37-39, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Exodus 17:6-7, Moses was told by God to strike the
rock at Horeb and water poured out. The miraculous water pouring out of a rock was
part of God's sustaining grace for Israel. The rock was a picture of the
Messiah to come, the true Rock, Jesus Christ, who would pay the heavy price for
the sins of mankind. </p>

<p class=Verses>““Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock at Horeb;
and you shall strike the rock, and water will come out of it, that the people
may drink.” And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel. He named the
place Massah and Meribah because of the quarrel of the sons of Israel, and
because they tested the LORD, saying, “Is the LORD among us, or not?”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Exodus
17:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Numbers 20:8-12, Moses was commanded by God to speak
to the rock at Meribah, not to strike it. In disobedience and anger at the
behavior of the Israelites, he struck the rock twice. Speaking to the rock was
a picture of Jesus Christ being exalted at the right hand of God the Father as
the Rock of Resurrection.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Take the rod; and you and your brother Aaron assemble
the congregation and speak to the rock before their eyes, that it may yield its
water. You shall thus bring forth water for them out of the rock and let the
congregation and their beasts drink.&quot; So Moses took the rod from before
the LORD, just as He had commanded him; and Moses and Aaron gathered the
assembly before the rock. And he said to them, &quot;Listen now, you rebels;
shall we bring forth water for you out of this rock?&quot; Then Moses lifted up
his hand and struck the rock twice with his rod; and water came forth
abundantly, and the congregation and their beasts drank. But the LORD said to
Moses and Aaron, &quot;Because you have not believed Me, to treat Me as holy in
the sight of the sons of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly
into the land which I have given them.&quot;” (Numbers 20:8-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ died spiritually only once for our sins.
When Moses struck the rock twice, his punishment as the leader of the
Israelites was that he would not enter the Promised Land because he did not
believe in God's integrity in front of the people. Jesus Christ cannot die
twice on the Cross for the sins of mankind - once was all that was needed.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Foundation Rock and Chief Cornerstone of the
Church </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is the Foundation Rock and Chief Cornerstone
of the Church. A cornerstone refers to the principal or fundamental element,
feature, or part of something. A cornerstone is defined as a stone built into
one corner of the foundation as the normal starting point for construction. The
cornerstone is the foundation stone at the angle of the structure by which the
builder fixes a standard for the bearing of the walls and the cross walls
throughout the structure.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ephesians 2:21, “being fitted together” refers to the
edification complex of the soul as does “a spiritual house” in 1 Peter 2:5. Matt.
16:16-18; 1 Cor. 3:11; Eph. 2:19-22.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;you also, as living stones, are being built up as a
spiritual house for a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices
acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.&quot;  (1 Peter 2:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Simon Peter answered, &quot;You are the Christ, the Son of the
living God.&quot; And Jesus said to him, &quot;Blessed are you, Simon Barjona,
because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but My Father who is in
heaven. &quot;I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will
build My church; and the gates of Hades will not overpower it.” (Matthew
16:16-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For no man can lay a foundation other than the one which is
laid, which is Jesus Christ.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 3:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are
fellow citizens with the saints, and are of God’s household, having been built
on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the
corner stone, in whom the whole building, being fitted together, is growing
into a holy temple in the Lord, in whom you also are being built together into
a dwelling of God in the Spirit.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 2:19-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 16:16-18, Peter recognized that “You are the
Christ, the Son of the living God.” Peter knew that he did not qualify to be “the
Rock” because he had a sin nature and could never gain supremacy over hell and
render hell ineffective. Only Christ could do that. Also, “Peter” in the Greek
is <span lang=EL>Πε</span>́<span lang=EL>τρος</span> (Petros) and means a piece
of the rock, a chip of stone, or little rock. Peter was an Apostle - one of 12.
Jesus Christ is the foundation of the Church. Peter definitely was NOT the
foundation of the Church as some believe. “This rock” is <span lang=EL>πε</span>́<span
lang=EL>τρα</span> (petra) and means large rock, bed-rock and refers to Jesus
Christ who is called the “Rock” throughout Scripture.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Foundation Rock and Chief Cornerstone of Israel</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is the Foundation Rock and Chief Cornerstone
of Israel. Isaiah 28:16; Rom. 9:33.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore thus says the Lord GOD, “Behold, I am laying in Zion
a stone, a tested stone, A costly cornerstone for the foundation, firmly
placed. He who believes in it will not be disturbed.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah 28:16,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“just as it is written, “BEHOLD, I LAY IN ZION A STONE OF
STUMBLING AND A ROCK OF OFFENSE, AND HE WHO BELIEVES IN HIM WILL NOT BE
DISAPPOINTED.”“  (Romans 9:33, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Rock of Stumbling For the Jews</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The religious Jews (Scribes, Pharisees, and Sadducees)
stumbled over Jesus Christ’s claim to be God and their Messiah for whom they
had been waiting so long. They rejected Him completely.  Psalms 118:20-22; Mark
12:10; 1 Cor. 1:23; Acts 4:10-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“This is the gate of the LORD; The righteous will enter through
it. I shall give thanks to You, for You have answered me, And You have become
my salvation. The stone which the builders rejected Has become the chief corner
stone. “  (Psalms 118:20-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Have you not even read this Scripture: 'THE STONE WHICH
THE BUILDERS REJECTED, THIS BECAME THE CHIEF CORNER stone;” (Mark 12:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block and
to Gentiles foolishness,” (1 Corinthians 1:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel,
that by the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom you crucified, whom God
raised from the dead—by this name this man stands here before you in good
health. &quot;He is the STONE WHICH WAS REJECTED by you, THE BUILDERS, but
WHICH BECAME THE CHIEF CORNER stone. &quot;And there is salvation in no one
else; for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men by
which we must be saved.&quot;” (Acts 4:10-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Rock of Judgment for Unbelievers</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is the Rock of Judgment for unbelievers.
Negative volition rejects the Savior, the Rock, Jesus Christ. At the Second
Advent, Jesus Christ will administer the Baptism of Fire. This baptism refers
to the removal of all unbelievers from the earth at the end of the Tribulation.
Only those believers remaining alive on the earth at the end of the Tribulation
will enter the Millennium in their physical bodies. 1 Peter 2:8; Matt. 21:44.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and, “A STONE OF STUMBLING AND A ROCK OF OFFENSE”; for they
stumble because they are disobedient to the word, and to this doom they were
also appointed.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Peter 2:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;And he who falls on this stone will be broken to
pieces; but on whomever it falls, it will scatter him like dust.&quot;&quot; 
(Matthew 21:44, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Rock of Provision and Stability</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is the Rock of Provision and Stability for
believers. Christ provides whatever you need to honor Him in the spiritual life.
The believer is to exercise faith rest and to claim God's many promises and to
rely on them. Isaiah 26:3-4; Matt. 7:24-25; Psalms 144:1-2. </p>

<p class=Verses>““The steadfast of mind You will keep in perfect peace, Because
he trusts in You. “Trust in the LORD forever, For in GOD the LORD, we have an
everlasting Rock.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah 26:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““Therefore everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts on
them, may be compared to a wise man who built his house on the rock. “And the
rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that
house; and yet it did not fall, for it had been founded on the rock.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew
7:24-25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“ A Psalm of David. Blessed be the LORD, my rock, Who trains my
hands for war, And my fingers for battle; My lovingkindness and my fortress, My
stronghold and my deliverer, My shield and He in whom I take refuge, Who
subdues my people under me.”  (Psalms 144:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Rock of Refuge and Protection</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is the Rock of Refuge and Protection for the
believer. The believer can be secure in taking refuge in His protection under
difficult conditions in life. The believer must apply the <i>epignosis</i> Bible
doctrine in the right lobe of their soul to the situation and use faith-rest to
put the situation in the Lord’s hands with confidence. This is part of God's
sustaining grace. Psalms 18:2; Psalms 18:31; Psalms 18:46; Psalms 62:5-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer, My God,
my rock, in whom I take refuge; My shield and the horn of my salvation, my
stronghold.” (Psalms 18:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“As for God, His way is blameless; The word of the LORD is
tried; He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him. For who is God, but the
LORD? And who is a rock, except our God,” (Psalms 18:30-31, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD lives, and blessed be my rock; And exalted be the God
of my salvation,” (Psalms 18:46, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“My soul, wait in silence for God only, For my hope is from
Him. He only is my rock and my salvation, My stronghold; I shall not be
shaken.” (Psalms 62:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Rock or Stone of Perfection </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is the Rock or Stone of Perfection. The
stone with seven eyes is the stone of perfection. The eye in Scripture refers
to intelligence. Jesus Christ has the perfect and absolute intelligence (omniscience)
and refers to His deity. Zech. 3:9-10; Zech. 4:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“'For behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; on one
stone are seven eyes. Behold, I will engrave an inscription on it,' declares
the LORD of hosts, 'and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day. 'In
that day,' declares the LORD of hosts, 'every one of you will invite his
neighbor to sit under his vine and under his fig tree.'&quot;” (Zechariah
3:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“'What are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will
become a plain; and he will bring forth the top stone with shouts of
&quot;Grace, grace to it!&quot;'&quot;” (Zechariah 4:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Soldier Stone</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is the Soldier Stone and the Rock of the
Military. Psalms 144:1</p>

<p class=Verses>“A Psalm of David. Blessed be the LORD, my rock, Who trains my
hands for war, And my fingers for battle;” (Psalms 144:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Rock of Encouragement</b></p>

<p class=Verses><span style='color:black;font-style:normal'>The Lord Jesus
Christ is the Rock of Encouragement to the maturing believer who is occupied
with Him. You have your eyes on the Lord Jesus Christ for your deliverance in
any situation, even when there is no change in the circumstances at all. The
deliverance is in the Bible doctrine in your soul. Isaiah 51:1; Isaiah 51:12. </span></p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Listen to me, you who pursue righteousness, Who seek the
LORD: Look to the rock from which you were hewn And to the quarry from which
you were dug.” (Isaiah 51:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I, even I, am He who comforts you. Who are you that you
are afraid of man who dies And of the son of man who is made like grass,”
(Isaiah 51:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Rock of Destruction </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is the Rock of Destruction. He is the Stone
cut out without hands. Jesus Christ destroys the restored Roman Empire in the
Armageddon campaign. The stone growing into a great mountain and filling the
whole earth refers to the Jesus Christ’s worldwide rulership in the Millennium.
Dan. 2:34-35. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/A/Armageddon%20of%20Tribulation.html">The
Armageddon Campaign of the Tribulation</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>““You continued looking until a stone was cut out without
hands, and it struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and crushed them. “Then
the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were crushed all at the
same time and became like chaff from the summer threshing floors; and the wind
carried them away so that not a trace of them was found. But the stone that
struck the statue became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.”  (Daniel
2:34-35, NASB)</p>
