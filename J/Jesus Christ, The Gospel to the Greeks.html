<h2>Jesus Christ, The Gospel to the Greeks</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You must understand and interpret the Bible in the time
in which it was written. To understand certain passages of Scripture that were
written in the times when the Roman Empire controlled the Middle East, you have
to go back and understand how they lived in the days of the Roman Empire. You
have to know the Grecian influence on the Roman Empire if you want to correctly
interpret Jesus Christ speaking to Greeks as in John 12. Our Lord had to communicate
to them in language and analogies that they understood. The whole Palm Sunday
incident was totally outside of their frame of reference!  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Our Lord’s Uses the Analogy of the Seed of Wheat</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 12:23, “Jesus answered them” is the present
middle indicative of <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>ποκρι</span>́<span
lang=EL>νομαι</span> (apokrinomai) and means to give an answer to a question
proposed, to answer, to begin to speak, but always where something has
preceded. “The hour” refers to the approaching crucifixion. “Has come” is the perfect
active indicative of <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓́<span lang=EL>ρχομαι</span>
(erchomai) and means this hour was designed in eternity past. The active voice means
the hour was approaching in six days with the reality of the Cross as the way
of eternal salvation. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And Jesus answered them, saying, &quot;The hour has come for
the Son of Man to be glorified.” (John 12:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Remember, the Greeks did not understand the Levitical
offerings, the Psalms, the basic Old Testament doctrines, the Jewish feasts, or
the tabernacle. But they did understand a seed of wheat producing a wheat crop.
This will be another way of describing the death of Christ. Many Greek legends
were built around the death of the seed. They understood that! </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 12:23, “for” indicates a purpose clause <span
lang=EL>ι</span>̔́<span lang=EL>να</span> (hina), “Son of Man” is a title for
the hypostatic union of Jesus Christ. “To be glorified” is the aorist passive
subjunctive of <span lang=EL>δοξα</span>́<span lang=EL>ζω</span> (doxazō). The
aorist tense refers to the resurrection, ascension, and session. The passive
voice means Christ will receive glorification by being seated at the right hand
of God the Father.  The subjunctive mood means He is not speaking of potential,
but goes with <i>hina</i> to introduce a purpose clause. The subjunctive has
other uses other than potential. It is sometimes used in the sense of an imperative
or sometimes it is used with some particle or conjunction to indicate what type
of a clause we have. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is the purpose of the God-man to go to the Cross and
bear the judgment of the sins of the world! This is a great passage on
communicating Bible doctrine to Greeks, instead of Jews.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Gospel Presented</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 12:24, “Truly, truly”  means truth, truth and
refers to a point of doctrine about to be presented. “I say to you” is the dative
of advantage. “Unless” is <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>α</span>́<span
lang=EL>ν</span> (ean) and introduces a third class condition that means maybe
it will, maybe it won’t. This way Jesus introduced the equivalent of a parable.
Any farmer knows that a seed must be alive to germinate. A dead seed put into
the ground remains a dead seed. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Grain of wheat” is <span lang=EL>κο</span>́<span
lang=EL>κκος</span> (kokkos) and refers to a planting seed. “Falls into the
earth and dies” is the aorist active participle of <span lang=EL>πι</span>́<span
lang=EL>πτω</span> (piptō). Action of the aorist participle precedes the
action of the main verb. “And dies” is the aorist active subjunctive of <span
lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>ποθνη</span>́<span lang=EL>σκω</span>
(apothnēskō) and means that the grain has to be in the ground first. Jesus
Christ must go to the Cross first before He can bear our sins.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat
falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much
fruit.” (John 12:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This was the best way to communicate the Gospel and the resurrection
to the Greeks. This is a technical word for Jesus Christ bearing the spiritual
death of man, bearing the imputed and inherent sins of man, as well as personal
sins. What are the wages of sin? Spiritual death.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 2:17, “for in the day that you eat from it you
will surely die” means that when Adam sinned, he immediately died spiritually. </p>

<p class=Verses>“but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall
not eat, for in the day that you eat from it you will surely die.&quot;”
(Genesis 2:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 12:24, “it remains alone” is the present active
indicative of <span lang=EL>με</span>́<span lang=EL>νω</span> (menō) and
refers to every seed planted is alone. This describes the seed after it is
planted. It is solitary. It has not multiplied yet. “But if it dies” is the
aorist active subjunctive (third-class condition setting up alternatives) of <span
lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>ποθνη</span>́<span lang=EL>σκω</span>
(apothnēskō). “It bears much fruit” is the present active indicative of <span
lang=EL>φε</span>́<span lang=EL>ρω</span> (pherō̄) and refers to the harvest.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord would go to the Cross alone. He would die alone
spiritually for the sins of mankind. He would be resurrected alone and be the First
Fruits. He would ascend to the third heaven alone. He is unique. He was alone!
This qualified Christ to be the only celebrity in the Church Age. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Our Lord Speaks of the Spiritual Life After Salvation </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 12:25, “He who loves his life” is the present
active participle of <span lang=EL>φιλε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (phileō)
which is the strongest word for love, a total love of the soul. Agape is a love
of mental attitude only. This is capacity for life. “He that keeps on loving
his life” is <span lang=EL>ψυχη</span>́ (psuchē) and refers to
self-consciousness, mentality, volition, emotions and conscience. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;He who loves his life loses it, and he who hates his
life in this world will keep it to life eternal.” (John 12:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“He who loves his life” is an idiom of Greek culture,
self-gratification, an attitude of the soul. It means to be stuck on yourself,
to have a false scale of values, to live for pleasure, self-gratification. “Loses
it” is the present active indicative of <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>πο</span>́<span
lang=EL>λλυμι</span> (apollumi) and is idiomatic and means to lose the purpose
or function of life - why you are here. Why is our Lord giving them doctrine
for living the spiritual life after salvation? Because some of the Greeks were
believing while He talked. The spiritual life begins immediately after
salvation! There will be no impact or purpose in life after salvation without
divine truth in the soul. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“He who hates his life” is the present active participle of
<span lang=EL>μισε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (miseō) and means putting the
spiritual ahead of the material. It is really the attitude of the mature
believer’s grace life. “Will keep” is the future active indicative of <span
lang=EL>φυλα</span>́<span lang=EL>σσω</span> (phulassō) and means to
deemphasize those things that lead to self-gratification and to emphasize Bible
doctrine. “To life eternal” means you take with you into eternity the Bible
doctrine you have in the right lobe of your soul.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>John 12:26 is referring to production of divine good in
the believer’s spiritual life resulting from intake and application of <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine. Bible doctrine in the soul produces effective Christian service
or divine good production. There is no service without the filling of the Holy
Spirit and <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the soul. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;If anyone serves Me, he must follow Me; and where I am,
there My servant will be also; if anyone serves Me, the Father will honor him.”
(John 12:26, NASB) </p>
