<h2>Jesus Christ’s Superiority</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is superior to the prophets. The prophets’
message was to reveal Christ. God the Father speaks through His Son about the
seven glories of Jesus Christ as the victor in the Angelic Conflict. Heb.
1:1-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“God, after He spoke long ago to the fathers in the prophets in
many portions and in many ways, in these last days has spoken to us in His Son,
whom He appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the world. And
He is the radiance of His glory and the exact representation of His nature, and
upholds all things by the word of His power. When He had made purification of
sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews
1:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is superior in His relationship. In His deity,
there is a Father-Son relationship which sets the pattern for the Father-Son
relationship in His humanity. Heb. 1:5; Luke 1:35.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For to which of the angels did He ever say, &quot;YOU ARE
MY SON, TODAY I HAVE BEGOTTEN YOU&quot;? And again, &quot;I WILL BE A FATHER TO
HIM AND HE SHALL BE A SON TO ME&quot;?&quot;  (Hebrews 1:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The angel answered and said to her, &quot;The Holy Spirit
will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; and for
that reason the holy Child shall be called the Son of God.&quot;  (Luke 1:35,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is superior in His Second Advent. In Hebrews
1:6, ”when” refers to the Second Advent, “He” is God the Father, and “firstborn”
is Jesus Christ. “All the angels” refers to elect angels because Jesus Christ
will have had Satan and all fallen angels removed from the earth and bound in
the Abyss (Hades) for 1,000 years as part of initiating the Millennium. Only
elect angels will be operative during the Millennium.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And when He again brings the firstborn into the world, He
says, “AND LET ALL THE ANGELS OF GOD WORSHIP HIM.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 1:6,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is superior in His ministry. In Hebrews
1:7-8, “His ministers a flame of fire” refers to angels who are servants of
Jesus Christ and are used to administer His judgments. “Righteous scepter”
refers to the impeccability of the humanity of Jesus Christ. “His kingdom”
refers to the Millennial Kingdom of Jesus Christ on earth.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And of the angels He says, “WHO MAKES HIS ANGELS WINDS, AND
HIS MINISTERS A FLAME OF FIRE.” But of the Son He says, “YOUR THRONE, O GOD, IS
FOREVER AND EVER, AND THE RIGHTEOUS SCEPTER IS THE SCEPTER OF HIS KINGDOM.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews
1:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is superior in His appointment. He was
appointed by God the Father to resolve the Angelic Conflict. While on earth,
Jesus Christ’s humanity chose the plan of the Father rather than the plan of
Satan. Satan wanted Him to act independently of God’s plan by bypassing the Cross
and accepting the crown. In Hebrews 1:9, “anointed You with oil” refers to the
sustaining ministry of the Holy Spirit. See category on <a
href="#_Appointment_of_Jesus">Appointment of Jesus Christ</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;YOU HAVE LOVED RIGHTEOUSNESS AND HATED LAWLESSNESS;
THEREFORE GOD, YOUR GOD, HAS ANOINTED YOU WITH THE OIL OF GLADNESS ABOVE YOUR
COMPANIONS.&quot;&quot;  (Hebrews 1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is superior as the Creator and sustainer of
the universe. In Hebrews 1:10, “Lord” refers to His deity. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And, &quot;YOU, LORD, IN THE BEGINNING LAID THE
FOUNDATION OF THE EARTH, AND THE HEAVENS ARE THE WORKS OF YOUR HANDS;&quot; 
(Hebrews 1:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is superior in His character. In Hebrews
1:11-12, “They will perish” refers to the time after the Millennium when the
heavens will be destroyed. “You remain” refers to the eternal life of Jesus
Christ. Psalms 90:2; Heb. 13:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;THEY WILL PERISH, BUT YOU REMAIN; AND THEY ALL WILL
BECOME OLD LIKE A GARMENT, AND LIKE A MANTLE YOU WILL ROLL THEM UP; LIKE A
GARMENT THEY WILL ALSO BE CHANGED. BUT YOU ARE THE SAME, AND YOUR YEARS WILL
NOT COME TO AN END.&quot;&quot;  (Hebrews 1:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Before the mountains were born Or You gave birth to the
earth and the world, Even from everlasting to everlasting, You are God.&quot; 
(Psalms 90:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and
forever.&quot;  (Hebrews 13:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is superior in His position. Jesus Christ in
His humanity is now superior to angels because He is now seated at the right
hand of God the Father. Heb. 1:4-5; Heb. 1:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;having become as much better than the angels, as He has
inherited a more excellent name than they. For to which of the angels did He
ever say, &quot;YOU ARE MY SON, TODAY I HAVE BEGOTTEN YOU&quot;? And again,
&quot;I WILL BE A FATHER TO HIM AND HE SHALL BE A SON TO ME&quot;?&quot; 
(Hebrews 1:4-5, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But to which of the angels has He ever said, &quot;SIT AT
MY RIGHT HAND, UNTIL I MAKE YOUR ENEMIES A FOOTSTOOL FOR YOUR
FEET&quot;?&quot;  (Hebrews 1:13, NASB)</p>
