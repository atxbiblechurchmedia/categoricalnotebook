<h2><a name="_Jesus_Christ,_Indwelling"></a>Jesus Christ, Indwelling</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The deity of Jesus Christ as the Shekinah Glory indwells
the body of every Church Age believer. This is unique in human history. Rom.
8:10; 2 Cor. 13:5; Gal. 2:20; Col. 1:27; 1 John 2:24.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin,
yet the spirit is alive because of righteousness.” (Romans 8:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Test yourselves to see if you are in the faith; examine
yourselves! Or do you not recognize this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is
in you—unless indeed you fail the test?” (2 Corinthians 13:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I
who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I
live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.”
(Galatians 2:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“to whom God willed to make known what is the riches of the
glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of
glory.” (Colossians 1:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“As for you, let that abide in you which you heard from the
beginning. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, you also will
abide in the Son and in the Father.” (1 John 2:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For the Church Age, Jesus Christ is not visible to
mankind on earth and will continue to reside in the third heaven until the
Rapture of the Church. In John 14:19-20, “I am in My Father” declares Christ’s
deity. “And you in Me” refers to the prophecy of the Baptism of the Holy Spirit
where God the Holy Spirit places every Church Age believer into union with
Jesus Christ at the moment of salvation. This is called Positional Sanctification.
“And I in you” refers to the indwelling of Jesus Christ in every Church Age
believer.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;After a little while the world will no longer see Me,
but you will see Me; because I live, you will live also. &quot;In that day you
will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.” (John 14:19-20,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>While our Lord was on earth, people who heard this
prophecy could see Christ’s humanity, but they could not see His deity. Prior
to that time, the same was true of the Shekinah Glory. Jesus Christ’s
indwelling of every Church Age believer is unique to our dispensation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 17:22, “The glory which You have given Me I have
given to them” is referring to the unique spiritual life that our Lord
pioneered while on earth. Every Church Age believer now has this exact same
spiritual life. The believer’s spiritual growth in that same spiritual life
empowered by God the Holy Spirit is the means by which we glorify Jesus Christ.
This glorification of Jesus Christ includes the indwelling of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;The glory which You have given Me I have given to them,
that they may be one, just as We are one;” (John 17:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 17:23, “I in them” refers to the prophecy of the
indwelling of Jesus Christ and the reality in every Church Age believer. “And
You in Me” refers to God the Father’s indwelling the humanity of our Lord
during His incarnation. “That they may be perfected in unity” means that God
the Father indwelt Jesus Christ so He would spiritually mature and fulfill
God’s plan and purpose and thereby glorify God. Jesus Christ indwells the
Church Age believer for the same purpose. Also, the indwelling of Jesus Christ
is a sign to you that God the Father loves you just as He loved Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I in them and You in Me, that they may be perfected in unity,
so that the world may know that You sent Me, and loved them, even as You have
loved Me.” (John 17:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 17:26, “the love” refers to the believer’s
personal love for God based on their spiritual growth. The believer must first
learn about Who and What God really is to begin to appreciate what God has done
for them. It also refers to the unconditional love for all mankind that a
growing believer gains through intake and application of Bible doctrine in the
spiritual life. “And I in them” refers to the indwelling of Jesus Christ. </p>

<p class=Verses>“and I have made Your name known to them, and will make it
known, so that the love with which You loved Me may be in them, and I in
them.&quot;” (John 17:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Purpose of Jesus Christ’s Indwelling</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The indwelling of the deity of Jesus Christ as the
Shekinah Glory is our guarantee that God will provide His unlimited grace
resources including the enabling divine power of the Holy Spirit who empowers
the believer to live the spiritual life and to fulfill His plan for their life.
This is the very same divine power used by the humanity of our Lord while on
earth during His First Advent</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The indwelling of the deity of Jesus Christ as the
Shekinah Glory is our guarantee that divine blessings will be given to the
believer who advances in the spiritual life and fulfills the plan of God for
their lives. These blessings are conveyed while the maturing believer lives on
earth and will be conveyed as eternal rewards at the Judgment Seat of Christ. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The indwelling of Jesus Christ guarantees our eternal
security, our eternal life after death and a resurrection body at the Rapture
of the Church and into eternity. You cannot lose your salvation no matter how
badly you fail in your life. The indwelling of the Son of God guarantees our
eternal life with Him forever. At physical death, the Son of God leaves our
body and escorts our soul and human spirit into the third heaven. You can’t see
Christ indwelling your body until your physical death. 2 Cor. 5:8; Psalms 23:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“we are of good courage, I say, and prefer rather to be absent
from the body and to be at home with the Lord.” (2 Corinthians 5:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
I fear no evil, for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.”
(Psalms 23:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The indwelling of Jesus Christ is a sign that every
Church Age believer is a member of the family of God, a royal priesthood. The Baptism
of the Holy Spirit is the means of forming the royal family of God. The
indwelling of Christ is the sign of the royal family and the uniqueness of the
Church Age. Because all believers in the Church Age are indwelt by Jesus Christ,
we have equal privilege and opportunity with all other believers. 1 Peter 2:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But you are A CHOSEN RACE, A royal PRIESTHOOD, A HOLY NATION,
A PEOPLE FOR God's OWN POSSESSION, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of
Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;” (1 Peter 2:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The indwelling of Jesus Christ is the basis for the
believer assigning top priority to their relationship with God over
relationships with people. This relationship is tested by your attitude toward
Bible doctrine. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Knowing that Jesus Christ indwells your body becomes the
motivation and confidence you need to advance to spiritual maturity. This
spiritual motivation is important as we face and handle undeserved suffering
and in doing so, grow spiritually even faster. Col. 1:27.</p>

<p class=Verses>“to whom God willed to make known what is the riches of the
glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of
glory.” (Colossians 1:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ as the Shekinah Glory indwelt the Tabernacle
and the two temples as a guarantee of Israel’s security as well as their
prosperity and blessing. Jesus Christ now indwells you as a guarantee of your
security, riches, and blessings both in this life and in eternity. Jesus Christ
conveys those blessings to His own righteousness in us.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Christ indwells us to motivate us to keep advancing
spiritually. If you understand the doctrine of the indwelling of Christ, you
will have the capacity to enjoy your grace blessings without being destroyed
from lack of capacity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Indwelling of Christ vs. Occupation with Christ</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is a difference between the indwelling of Christ
and the occupation with Christ. Occupation with Christ is gained by the
maturing believer. The indwelling of Christ occurs at salvation and does not
change. It is permanent. You cannot lose the indwelling of Christ, but you can
lose occupation with Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You do not experience the indwelling of God the Father,
God the Son, God the Holy Spirit, the sealing of the Spirit, or the Baptism of
the Spirit at salvation. You do not feel these things. In Ephesians 3:17, “so
that Christ may dwell in your hearts” refers to the maturing believer’s
occupation with Christ, not the indwelling of Christ.</p>

<p class=Verses>“so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; and
that you, being rooted and grounded in love,” (Ephesians 3:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The indwelling of Jesus Christ belongs to every Church
Age believer’s body as the Shekinah Glory at the moment of faith in Christ and
remains a permanent possession. Occupation with Christ is the maturing believer
living the majority of their time in the filling of the Holy Spirit and
fulfilling God's plan for their lives. Occupation with Christ belongs only to
the believer with Bible doctrine as number one priority and who uses God's
grace resources to execute God's plan for their lives. They are thinking with
the mind of Christ and are reflecting His glory in their spiritual life. Occupation
with Christ is an experience for maturing believers only. 1 Cor. 2:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT
HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.” (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Christ is at home in their souls where His thinking is
resident. This is totally different from the indwelling of the Father, Son, and
Holy Spirit in our bodies. Christ being at home in our hearts is the experience
of occupation with Christ.  See category on <a
href="#_D-Jesus_Christ,_Occupation">Jesus Christ, Occupation with</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Indwelling of Christ vs. Indwelling of the Holy Spirit</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The indwelling of the Holy Spirit in the body of the
Church Age believer is not that same as indwelling of the deity of Jesus Christ
in the body of the Church Age believer. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Holy Spirit indwells the Church Age believer at the
moment of salvation to prepare a suitable abode or temple for the indwelling of
the deity of Jesus Christ as the Shekinah Glory. Therefore, the Church Age believer’s
body becomes a temple of the Holy Spirit. Gal. 2:20; 2 Cor. 13:5; Col. 1:27; 1
Cor. 6:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>““I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who
live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live
by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Galatians
2:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Test yourselves to see if you are in the faith; examine
yourselves! Or do you not recognize this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is
in you—unless indeed you fail the test?”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Corinthians 13:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“to whom God willed to make known what is the riches of the
glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of
glory.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Colossians 1:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy
Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and that you are not your own?”
(1 Corinthians 6:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Lord Jesus Christ indwells the believer for the
purpose of fellowship. Rev. 3:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“‘Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears My
voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and will dine with him, and he
with Me.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation 3:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The indwelling of the deity of Jesus Christ and the
indwelling of the Holy Spirit are the basis for the unique spiritual life. Rom
8:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin,
yet the spirit is alive because of righteousness.” (Romans 8:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Motivation from the indwelling of Jesus Christ is related
to the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. The one who “keeps His commandments” is
the growing believer who comes to understand all that God has provided in His
grace resources that enables them to live the spiritual life. 1 John 3:23-24. See
category on <a href="#_Holy_Spirit,_Indwelling_1">Holy Spirit, Indwelling</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“This is His commandment, that we believe in the name of His
Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, just as He commanded us. The one who
keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in him. We know by this that He
abides in us, by the Spirit whom He has given us.” (1 John 3:23-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Indwelling of Christ vs. Glorification of Christ</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The indwelling of Jesus Christ in our bodies is not the
same as the glorification of Christ in our bodies. His indwelling is permanent
after salvation and does not change based on the believer’s spiritual growth.
In contrast, the glorification of Christ in our bodies is the ultimate
experience related to the believer’s spiritual maturity. As the believer
matures in Bible doctrine, their relationship and experience with Christ
matures.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Galatians 4:19, “Christ is formed in you” and in
Ephesians 3:17, “Christ may dwell in your hearts” and in Philippians 1:20, “Christ
will even now, as always, be exalted in my body” all refer to the believer as
they gain more Bible doctrine in the right lobe of their soul and mature
spiritually. This is the edification complex of the soul being constructed with
more and more <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine. The maturing believer
progressively takes on more of the same motivation and attitude as the humanity
of Christ had while on earth.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“My children, with whom I am again in labor until Christ is
formed in you—” (Galatians 4:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; and
that you, being rooted and grounded in love,” (Ephesians 3:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“according to my earnest expectation and hope, that I will not
be put to shame in anything, but that with all boldness, Christ will even now,
as always, be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death.” (Philippians
1:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You glorify God in your body by gaining the knowledge of
our Lord Jesus Christ and growing spiritually and thereby fulfilling God's plan
for your life. 1 Cor. 3:16; 1 Cor. 6:19-20; 2 Cor. 6:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do you not know that you are a temple of God and that the
Spirit of God dwells in you?” (1 Corinthians 3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy
Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and that you are not your own?
For you have been bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body.” (1
Corinthians 6:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Or what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For we are
the temple of the living God; just as God said, &quot;I WILL DWELL IN THEM AND
WALK AMONG THEM; AND I WILL BE THEIR GOD, AND THEY SHALL BE MY PEOPLE.” (2
Corinthians 6:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 6:16, “idols” here refers to the
Corinthian temples. Paul was asking the Corinthians why they were frequenting
the Corinthian temples where the various gods and goddesses of sex were
worshipped and the best food and drinks in town were served when their own
bodies are the temple of the living God. The Corinthian believers were still
living as though they were unbelievers. Their thinking had not yet been renewed
through the intake and application of the Word of God. Col. 3:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and have put on the new self who is being renewed to a true
knowledge according to the image of the One who created him—” (Colossians 3:10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Holy Spirit is the teacher of the doctrine of the
indwelling of Jesus Christ. This can only occur if we keep learning doctrine.
By continuing to learn Bible doctrine via the filling of the Holy Spirit, we
come to know that the deity of Jesus Christ resides in us. Jesus Christ indwells
our bodies since salvation, but Jesus Christ being glorified in our bodies is only
experienced as we approach spiritual maturity. Gal. 4:19; Eph. 3:17; Phil.
1:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“My children, with whom I am again in labor until Christ is
formed in you—” (Galatians 4:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; and
that you, being rooted and grounded in love,” (Ephesians 3:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“according to my earnest expectation and hope, that I will not
be put to shame in anything, but that with all boldness, Christ will even now,
as always, be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death.” (Philippians
1:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>From the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, we learn about
the indwelling of Jesus Christ as the Shekinah Glory, and this results in the
transformation of our lives into the image of the Shekinah Glory. This is the
glorification of Jesus Christ as we think more and more as did our Lord while
He was on earth. 2 Cor. 3:14-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But their minds were hardened; for until this very day at the
reading of the old covenant the same veil remains unlifted, because it is
removed in Christ.” (2 Corinthians 3:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 3:14, “their minds were hardened” and
the “veil” refer to the scar tissue of the soul of the unbelieving Jews as they
hardened their negative volition toward their Messiah. Only positive faith
belief in the Savior can remove this veil. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Jews read about Christ in the Old Testament, but they
did not believe their long-awaited Messiah had arrived. They believed they were
acceptable to God merely by being born a Jew and adhering to the Mosaic Law as
best they could. They erroneously believed in their good works to gain an
eternal relationship with God. Rom. 9:30-33; Gal. 2:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“What shall we say then? That Gentiles, who did not pursue
righteousness, attained righteousness, even the righteousness which is by
faith; but Israel, pursuing a law of righteousness, did not arrive at that law.
Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as though it were by works.
They stumbled over the stumbling stone, just as it is written, &quot;BEHOLD, I
LAY IN ZION A STONE OF STUMBLING AND A ROCK OF OFFENSE, AND HE WHO BELIEVES IN
HIM WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.&quot;” (Romans 9:30-33, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“nevertheless knowing that a man is not justified by the works
of the Law but through faith in Christ Jesus, even we have believed in Christ
Jesus, so that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of
the Law; since by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified.” (Galatians
2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Age of the Jews, the deity of Jesus Christ was
present indwelling the Holy of Holies but could not be seen. He was invisible
to Israel. There was also a physical veil between the Holy Place and Holy of
Holies. They were taught by the priests about Christ from the articles of
sacred furniture and from their ritual feasts. The visible manifestation that
the Shekinah Glory was indwelling the Tabernacle was the cloud, a theophany,
which covered the Tabernacle. 2 Corinthians 3:15 tells us that this veil of
unbelief and hardened heart for the Jew remains.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“But to this day whenever Moses is read, a veil lies over their
heart;” (2 Corinthians 3:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Church Age, when a Jew believes in Christ, the
veil is removed and Jesus Christ, as the Shekinah Glory, indwells their body. 2
Cor. 3:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but whenever a person turns to the Lord, the veil is taken
away.” (2 Corinthians 3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Today, Jesus Christ is not on earth and cannot be seen.
Also, the indwelling deity of Jesus Christ cannot be seen. He is invisible to
us. The visible manifestation today that the Shekinah Glory indwells the
believer is their attainment of spiritual maturity. Though the teaching
ministry of the Spirit, the indwelling of Jesus Christ as the Shekinah Glory
can be understood and that glory can be reflected through the renewed thinking
of the believer as they mature spiritually. 2 Cor. 3:17-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord
is, there is liberty. But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror
the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to
glory, just as from the Lord, the Spirit.” (2 Corinthians 3:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“The unveiled face” is the Jewish believer in the Church
Age. This is the believer growing and being transformed in the knowledge of our
Lord Jesus Christ and by doing so though the grace resources provided by God
the Father, begins to reflect the glory of Jesus Christ, the Shekinah Glory
within them. “Beholding as in a mirror” refers to the Word of God. “The glory
of the Lord” refers to the glory of the resident Shekinah Glory being reflected
in the maturing believer’s soul. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Indwelling of Christ Related to Positional Truth</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At salvation, the Holy Spirit places the believer into union
with Christ. This is called current positional truth. Current positional truth
is identification with Christ in His resurrection, ascension, and session - His
current status. We are currently identified with Christ and we share His
heirship, sonship, righteousness, eternal life, election, and destiny.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Retroactive positional truth is identification with
Christ in His physical death and burial. Retroactive positional truth is related
to the indwelling of Jesus Christ and is a part of the Baptism of the Holy
Spirit. In Galatians 2:20, “crucified with Christ” refers to retroactive
positional truth and “Christ lives in me” refers to the indwelling of the deity
of Jesus Christ in the body of every Church Age believer. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I
who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I
live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.”
(Galatians 2:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When God the Father imputed all the sins of the human
race, past, present, and future, to the body of the humanity Jesus Christ on
the Cross, He then judged them. At the same time, God the Father rejected human
good and evil. Therefore, human good and evil were not judged on the Cross. 1
Peter 2:24; 2 Cor. 5:21.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“and He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, so that
we might die to sin and live to righteousness; for by His wounds you were
healed.” (1 Peter 2:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that
we might become the righteousness of God in Him.” (2 Corinthians 5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Retroactive positional truth means that we were
identified positionally with Christ in His spiritual death. When God the Father
rejected human good and evil, positionally we have also rejected human good and
evil. As a result, we as believers must also oppose human good and evil in our
lives. Retroactive positional truth combines with current positional truth to remove
the sovereignty of the old sin nature in the body where our Lord Jesus Christ
now indwells.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>While the Baptism of the Holy Spirit at salvation and
positional truth nullify the power of Satan as well as the old sin nature, we
must learn to apply these principles as we learn and apply <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine to our lives. As we mature spiritually, we are able through
accumulated Bible doctrine in the right lobe of our souls to more consistently
use the enabling power of the Holy Spirit in our spiritual life to fulfill the
plan of God for our lives. Col. 3:1-4; Rom. 6:1-8; Col. 2:12. See category on <a

<p class=Verses>“Therefore if you have been raised up with Christ, keep seeking
the things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your
mind on the things above, not on the things that are on earth. For you have
died and your life is hidden with Christ in God. When Christ, who is our life,
is revealed, then you also will be revealed with Him in glory.” (Colossians
3:1-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“having been buried with Him in baptism, in which you were also
raised up with Him through faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the
dead.” (Colossians 2:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Indwelling of Christ Emphasizes our Relationship with
God </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Today, believers seem to be looking for ways to improve
their relationships with other people – believers and unbelievers. The problem
is that they are not looking at what God has to say about it in the Word of
God. By doing so, they are seeking human solutions that always seem to bring
unintended consequences to their relationships and ignoring divine solutions
that are the only real solutions. Growing in grace and knowledge of our Lord
Jesus Christ through the intake and application of Bible doctrine results in
right relationships with other people. 2 Peter 3:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory, both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.”
(2 Peter 3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Because of the indwelling of Jesus Christ, the Church Age
believer should not put human relationships ahead of their relationship with
God. The believer’s priorities confirm who is closest to them. If it’s people,
enough said. But if it is with God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit who indwell
you, then that is the pattern that glorifies God. Through spiritual growth, the
believer gains understanding of God and what He has done and continues to do in
their spiritual life. You form your correct priorities through the enabling
power of the Holy Spirit and the indwelling of Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The growing believer puts their relationship with God
ahead of relationships with people. The believer negative or indifferent to
Bible doctrine will put their relationships with people first. Their life will
be filled with divine discipline and self-induced misery. Jer. 17:5; Jer. 17:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Thus says the LORD, &quot;Cursed is the man who trusts in
mankind And makes flesh his strength, And whose heart turns away from the
LORD.” (Jeremiah 17:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD And whose
trust is the LORD.” (Jeremiah 17:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual growth produces unconditional love for others
motivated by personal love for the Lord. It also produces a capacity for
romance, friendships, marriage, and social life. When your priorities are
God-centered, your people priorities will fall into place. </p>
