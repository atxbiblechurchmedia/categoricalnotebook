<h2>Jews, Basis for Evaluation</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are three categories of Jews – racial, religious,
and regenerate. A racial Jew is any member of homo sapiens that has even one
gene of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It has to be all three. A regenerate Jew is
a racial Jew that has accepted Jesus Christ as their Savior. Rom. 9:6-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But it is not as though the word of God has failed. For
they are not all Israel who are descended from Israel; nor are they all
children because they are Abraham's descendants, but: &quot;THROUGH ISAAC YOUR
DESCENDANTS WILL BE NAMED.&quot;&quot;  (Romans 9:6-7, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A religious Jew is a racial Jew that has not accepted
Jesus Christ as Savior and has turned to Judaism. You should evaluate all Jews
as individuals. Jews are human beings just like you are. Israel is a legitimate
nation today that fought for their freedom. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first warning against Anti-Semitism is given in Genesis
12:1-3. Anti-Semitism is hostility toward the Jews like the unregenerate Arab
has. Anti-Semitism is hostility toward or discrimination against Jews as a
religious or racial group. The study of the Word of God teaches to never allow
yourself to fall into the trap of anti-Semitism. This mental attitude has
uniformly caused the downfall of nations. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Now the LORD said to Abram, “Go forth from your country, And
from your relatives And from your father’s house, To the land which I will show
you; And I will make you a great nation, And I will bless you, And make your
name great; And so you shall be a blessing; And I will bless those who bless
you, And the one who curses you I will curse. And in you all the families of
the earth will be blessed.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis 12:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>American Jews should be evaluated as a American citizens,
their patriotism, their politics, etc. Jews fought in wars for the USA, they
died at the Alamo, etc. Evaluate the Jew as a nation of Jews - the nation is
called Israel today, which is not under God. Zionism is the attempt to fulfill
the covenants under man’s ability rather than under God’s ability, which will
be at the Second Advent of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Palestine is a Gentile name for Israel, which comes from
the proper name Philistia and is not an accepted name from Israel’s thinking. The
Jews are under the fifth cycle of discipline (dispersion among the Gentile
nations) and will continue to be until the Second Advent. Israel back in the
land today is simply based on unbelief.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are certain Jews who are internationalists.
Communism was founded by Marx and Engel. Both were German Jews. These Jews
should be evaluated just as any Gentile. Their writings and actions should be
condemned on the basis of the Word.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A Jew who becomes a believer in Jesus Christ in the
Church Age is no longer evaluated as a Jew, but as a member of the Body of
Christ who are all placed into union with Christ at salvation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At times conservatism (which has excellent goals) can
lose sight of their goals because certain conservative organizations become
anti-Semitic. Some blame all the world’s problems on the Jews. Some blame the
Jews for financing Communism and international conspiracies. Certainly some
money does come from the Jews, but Gentiles contribute also. British-Israelism
is a false concept and is anti-Semitic at its core. It is not true that
Israelites are good guys and the Jews are bad guys.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Beware of anti-Semitism. Many goofy publications are
available today that are negative toward the Jews. Some politicians get
involved in this and may lead to their defeat in part due to anti-Semitic
sentiments or statements. Gen. 12:3. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/A/Anti-Semitism.html">Anti-Semitism</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And I will bless those who bless you, And the one who curses
you I will curse. And in you all the families of the earth will be
blessed.&quot;” (Genesis 12:3, NASB)</p>
