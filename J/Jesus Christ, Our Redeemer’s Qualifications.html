<h2>Jesus Christ, Our Redeemer’s Qualifications</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Redemption is the saving work of Jesus Christ on the
Cross whereby He purchased the spiritual freedom of every member of the human
race. Jesus Christ set them all free by His substitutionary spiritual death for
all sins of mankind - past, present and future. 2 Cor. 5:21; 1 Peter 2:24; Eph.
1:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that
we might become the righteousness of God in Him.” (2 Corinthians 5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, so that
we might die to sin and live to righteousness; for by His wounds you were
healed.” (1 Peter 2:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness
of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace” (Ephesians 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Just as today in the Church Age, Old Testament believers
were taught that the soul would be redeemed, not the body. If the body were
redeemed, we would never die physically. Old Testament believers like Job
applied the doctrine of redemption to their circumstances just as we do, but
they looked to the future substitutionary spiritual death of Jesus Christ on
the Cross when our Lord would redeem them. Job 19:25; Psalms 34:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;As for me, I know that my Redeemer lives, And at the
last He will take His stand on the earth.” (Job 19:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD redeems the soul of His servants, And none of those
who take refuge in Him will be condemned.” (Psalms 34:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is the only qualified redeemer for mankind
in all of history. For Christ to be qualified as our redeemer, He had to do the
seven following things. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>1. He had to
be a true member of the human race,</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>2. He had to
be without sin of any kind (impeccable) prior to the act of redemption, </i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>3. He had to
be the mediator between God and man and be equal with both parties,</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>4. He had to
freely choose to go to the Cross and become our redeemer,</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>5. He had to
willingly accept the penalty for each and every one of mankind’s sins while on
the Cross, </i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>6. He had to
remain without sin of any kind throughout the act of redemption on the Cross,
and</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>7. He could
not use His deity apart from God the Father’s plan in any way throughout His
life (Kenosis) and while purchasing our spiritual freedom on the Cross.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He could not save us as God because the redeemer of
mankind must be judged for the sins of mankind. God cannot be judged for
anything. A true and sinless member of the human race was required. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Jesus Christ Had to Become a True Member of the Human
Race</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Only the Lord Jesus Christ in Hypostatic Union was
qualified to die for the sins of the world. It was necessary for one member of
the Godhead to take on the form of humanity because as God’s sovereignty is not
subject to death, His absolute righteousness (+R) cannot have contact with sin,
His eternal life cannot die, His omnipresence cannot be reduced to one location
– on the Cross, His omnipotence is able not to die and not able to die, and His
immutability means that God cannot change. Therefore, none of God’s
characteristics can ever change.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It was necessary for Jesus Christ to become a true member
of the human race to be qualified to be Savior. Only a human being who lives a
perfect life would be qualified to pay the penalty of sin which is spiritual
death. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It was necessary for Jesus Christ to become humanity in
order to die physically, so that He could have a resurrection body as would all
believers. It was necessary for our Lord’s humanity in a resurrection body to
ascend into heaven and be acceptable to God the Father, so that believers in
resurrection bodies would also be acceptable to God the Father. John 3:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;No one has ascended into heaven, but He who descended
from heaven: the Son of Man.” (John 3:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For Jesus Christ to become a true member of the human
race and to be born sinless, He had to be born without a human father. This is
because it is the male's 23 chromosomes that carry the old sin nature and not
the female's. This means that if a woman’s ovum could be fertilized apart from
a human male’s 23 chromosomes (i.e., a virgin pregnancy), then the child could
be born into the world without an old sin nature.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Without a genetically-formed old sin nature in every cell
as has all of the rest of humanity, then God the Father would not have a
destination or target to which He could impute Adam's original sin at physical
birth. This means such a child would not be born spiritually dead and,
therefore, would pass the first qualification for being a redeemer. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The virgin birth was the basis for redemption, because it
provided the world with a perfect human being, the only One qualified to be
judged for the sins of the world. In order to become our redeemer, Jesus Christ
had to become a true member of the human race for at least four reasons. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first reason was that He had to become our Savior. As
the Son of God, He could not have any involvement with sin. To provide
redemption, every sin of the entire human race had to be imputed to Christ on
the Cross. God the Father then had to judge each and every one of those sins.
Without becoming true and sinless humanity, Jesus Christ could not have been
judged for the sins of mankind.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The second reason was that Jesus Christ also had to
become a true member of the human race so He could be our mediator between
sinful mankind and perfect God. A mediator must be equal with both parties. 1
Tim. 2:5-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For there is one God, and one mediator also between God and
men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave Himself as a ransom for all, the testimony
given at the proper time.” (1 Timothy 2:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The third reason was that Jesus Christ also had to become
our High Priest. Hebrews 7-9. A priest is simply any member of the human race
who represents themselves or humanity in general before God. Jesus Christ is
our great High Priest today and is seated at the right hand of the Father in
His humanity and makes intercession for us. He became a royal priest unlike the
Levitical priests in the Old Testament. Because Jesus Christ is a royal priest,
Church Age believers are royal family and are unique in their position because
we share His position. This grace position occurred after the Holy Spirit
baptized us by placing us in union with Jesus Christ (Positional
Sanctification) at the point of salvation. 1 Peter 2:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But you are A CHOSEN RACE, A royal PRIESTHOOD, A HOLY NATION,
A PEOPLE FOR God's OWN POSSESSION, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of
Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;” (1 Peter 2:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fourth reason why Jesus Christ had to become a true
member of the human race is He had to become man to be the Son of David in
order to fulfill the Davidic Covenant. More than 3,000 years ago, God promised
David that he would have a son who would reign forever. In His Second Advent,
our Lord will fulfill that promise to David.  2 Sam. 7; Psalms 89; 2 Chron. 21.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Our Lord’s Sinlessness (Impeccability)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord was born without a sin nature, but could still
be tempted to sin externally (by others). Our Lord’s humanity was sustained on
earth throughout His entire life by God the Holy Spirit - His humanity was
always filled with the Spirit. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This was unique in all of human history because Jesus
Christ was the first to prove the application of a new spiritual life given to
Him at His birth by God the Father to be used by all Church Age believers
following salvation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It was this impeccable human nature that redeemed us.
This salvation work is called the Blood of Jesus Christ. Our Lord is called a
lamb without spot and without blemish because He remained without even a single
mental attitude sin throughout His entire life - even under the most tremendous
punishment and pain which none of us will ever know. 1 Peter 1:18-19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable things like
silver or gold from your futile way of life inherited from your forefathers,
but with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and spotless, the blood of
Christ.” (1 Peter 1:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Even though He had no old sin nature inside to tempt Him,
Satan himself tempted Him many times, something Satan did only with Adam and
Eve. After 40 days without food, He was tempted to turn stones into bread. If
He had, it would have been contrary to God the Father’s plan for His life and
therefore a sin. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When Satan offered our Lord the entire world to rule, he
meant it as he was and still is the ruler of the world. If Jesus Christ had
accepted the temptation from Satan, we would not have our so great salvation. Matt.
4:1-4; Matt. 4:8-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be
tempted by the devil. And after He had fasted forty days and forty nights, He
then became hungry. And the tempter came and said to Him, &quot;If You are the
Son of God, command that these stones become bread.&quot; But He answered and
said, &quot;It is written, 'MAN SHALL NOT LIVE ON BREAD ALONE, BUT ON EVERY
WORD THAT PROCEEDS OUT OF THE MOUTH OF GOD.'&quot;” (Matthew 4:1-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Again, the devil took Him to a very high mountain and showed
Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory; and he said to Him,
&quot;All these things I will give You, if You fall down and worship me.&quot;
Then Jesus said to him, &quot;Go, Satan! For it is written, 'YOU SHALL WORSHIP
THE LORD YOUR GOD, AND SERVE HIM ONLY.'&quot;” (Matthew 4:8-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Jesus Christ Had to Qualify as the Mediator Between
God and Man</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mediator is synonymous with arbitrator, judge, or umpire.
It refers to a person who has the power to judge a dispute between two parties.
He must be objective and have the facts. A mediator is a neutral negotiator of
peace, whom both sides can trust.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Only a mediator can establish a relation between two
hitherto unrelated entities in order to mediate their coming together for some
purpose. A mediator removes disagreement and estrangement between two
antagonistic parties. A mediator brings them to a common goal or unity. The
mediator must be agreed to by both parties, for he interposes between two
parties as the equal of each. By so doing, reconciliation is established and a
contract is made.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In order to be our redeemer, Jesus Christ had to qualify
as the mediator between God and man and be equal with both parties. Jesus
Christ is both God and true humanity in one person - the Hypostatic Union. 
Hypostatic Union refers to the two natures of Jesus Christ that are inseparably
united and without mixture or loss of their separate identities. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Since His incarnation, our Lord Jesus Christ is both true
humanity and undiminished deity in one person forever. As true humanity, Jesus
Christ is equal and superior to all members of the human race. As the Son of
God, the second person of the Trinity, Jesus Christ is perfect God co-equal and
co-eternal as is God the Father and God the Holy Spirit. Therefore, as the
unique God-man, He was qualified to be the mediator between perfect God and
sinful man.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ prior to His incarnation was only true and
perfect deity. Following His First Advent at the point of the virgin birth,
Jesus Christ became the unique God-man in Hypostatic Union forever. To
accomplish this, God the Father must be propitiated and man must be reconciled
to God. Therefore the mediator must redeem man to accomplish this. Christ
accomplished mediatorship through the uniqueness of His person and the
uniqueness of His work: redemption, propitiation and reconciliation. 1 Tim.
2:5-6; Heb. 9:15-16; Heb. 12:24.</p>

<p class=Verses>For there is one God, and one mediator also between God and
men, the man Christ Jesus,  who gave Himself as a ransom for all, the testimony
given at the proper time.  (1 Timothy 2:5-6 NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>For this reason He is the mediator of a new covenant, so that,
since a death has taken place for the redemption of the transgressions that
were committed under the first covenant, those who have been called may receive
the promise of the eternal inheritance.  For where a covenant is, there must of
necessity be the death of the one who made it.  (Hebrews 9:15-16 NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the
sprinkled blood, which speaks better than the blood of Abel.  (Hebrews 12:24
NASB)  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Jesus Christ Had to Freely Choose to Go to the Cross
and Become Our Redeemer</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ had to willingly go to the Cross even though
He was fully aware of what was to happen. This was the ultimate test of His
free will and the personal sense of destiny of our Lord. He understood that
untold physical, mental and especially spiritual suffering that awaited Him and
yet He chose to go freely and fulfill the Father’s plan. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This test of Jesus Christ’s unconditional virtue love for
every member of the human race is illustrated in Matthew 26:39-44 where our
Lord prayed three times that He was willing to be our redeemer, if it was the Father’s
will for His life.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“And He went a little beyond them, and fell on His face and
prayed, saying, &quot;My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me;
yet not as I will, but as You will.&quot; And He came to the disciples and
found them sleeping, and said to Peter, &quot;So, you men could not keep watch
with Me for one hour? &quot;Keep watching and praying that you may not enter
into temptation; the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.&quot; He went
away again a second time and prayed, saying, &quot;My Father, if this cannot
pass away unless I drink it, Your will be done.&quot; Again He came and found
them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. And He left them again, and went away
and prayed a third time, saying the same thing once more.” (Matthew 26:39-44,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Jesus Christ Had to Willingly Accept the Penalty for
Mankind’s Sins</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One of the most important aspects of our Lord’s
substitutionary spiritual death on the Cross was His awareness of each and
every one of mankind’s sins as He accepted them during the imputation of all of
them from God the Father. He accepted every sin based on His unconditional love
for each of us. Following this imputation of all mankind’s sins, Jesus Christ’s
humanity who had never known sin now had all of them imputed to His body. 2
Cor. 5:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that
we might become the righteousness of God in Him.” (2 Corinthians 5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The next and most important phase of our Lord’s
substitutionary work on the Cross involved His unwavering willingness to accept
each sin’s penalty based on His personal virtue love for God the Father. The
humanity of Jesus Christ developed this virtue love that was unparalleled in
human history from the Bible doctrine that He learned and applied throughout
His life just as all believers do now in the Church Age. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord’s acceptance of the imputed judgement for each
sin was the ultimate act of virtue love that a believer can possibly have. Our
Lord was the first to test the limits of the spiritual life for believers.
Although He was tested far beyond our abilities, He found no limits to the
omnipotent sustaining power of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Jesus Christ Had to Remain Without Sin Throughout the
Act of Redemption</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The three hours of darkness that covered Golgotha were
the most intensive moments in all of history. The judgement for every single
sin of the human race was withheld until our Lord Jesus Christ reached the
Cross in a state of perfect sinlessness or impeccability. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Father, in His perfect justice, then imputed all
of mankind’s sins to the humanity of Jesus Christ. The humanity of Jesus Christ
willingly accepted all of mankind’s sins, from the first sin in the Garden to
the last sin to be committed in the Millennium. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Father then judged all of those sins. Then and
most importantly, the humanity of Jesus Christ sustained only by the Holy
Spirit as we are today, willingly and without sinning even mentally, accepted
the tremendous punishment due to each and every one of them. Because our sins
were imputed to Christ on the Cross and judged, we can believe in Him and
receive redemption and 39 other things at the moment of our salvation faith
belief. See category on <a href="#_Salvation,_40_Things">The Forty Things
Received at Salvation</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In His unique spiritual death, Jesus Christ received, in
three hours, the judgment for an uncountable number of mankind’s sins. This was
why He screamed to God the Father in Matthew 27:46, &quot;My God, My God, why
have You forsaken Me?&quot; Matt. 27:46.</p>

<p class=Verses>“About the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice,
saying, &quot;ELI, ELI, LAMA SABACHTHANI?&quot; that is, &quot;MY GOD, MY GOD,
WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME?&quot;” (Matthew 27:46, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The judgement received in our place was so intense that
He screamed out. Even through all of this, Jesus Christ had to remain perfectly
sinless. His humanity could not leave the fellowship with the Holy Spirit at
any point during the bearing of our sins. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He didn't sin and didn't even react to the judgement. Not
only did He remain impeccable, but He endured the suffering. The power of the
Holy Spirit sustained Jesus Christ continually when He was on the Cross just as
He did His entire life on earth. That same omnipotent power is now available to
every Church Age believer while filled with the Holy Spirit to sustain us
during our short time here on earth.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Jesus Christ Could Not Use His Deity Apart From God
The Father’s Plan In Any Way Throughout His Life And While Purchasing Our
Spiritual Freedom</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In fulfilling the Father's plan while here on earth,
certain attributes of our Lord's deity were not used. However, this does not
imply that they were either surrendered or destroyed. In fulfilling the
Father's plan, certain attributes of our Lord's deity were not used to benefit
Himself, to provide for Himself, or to glorify Himself. Phil. 2:5-8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ
Jesus, who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality
with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a
bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men. Being found in appearance
as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even
death on a cross.” (Philippians 2:5-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In taking on the form of true humanity, the deity of Jesus
Christ veiled His preincarnate glory.  However, Jesus Christ never surrendered
or destroyed even one characteristic of His divine essence. This is the
doctrine of Kenosis. The perfect man, Jesus Christ in His humanity, became a
bond-servant. While our Lord was paying for our sins on the Cross, His deity
continued to hold the universe together by the word of His power as He always
has since He created it. Heb. 1:3. See category on <a href="#_D-Kenosis">Kenosis</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He is the radiance of His glory and the exact
representation of His nature, and upholds all things by the word of His power.
When He had made purification of sins, He sat down at the right hand of the
Majesty on high,” (Hebrews 1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It’s very important to remember that our Lord did not
depend upon His own omnipotence, but upon the omnipotence of God the Holy
Spirit during His entire existence on earth. Only in this way could He remain
true and sinless humanity and be our redeemer. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Results of Our Redemption</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our redemption through the Blood of Jesus Christ means we
have a perfect and eternal salvation through a simple and uncluttered act of
faith in that perfect work. We should also remember that redemption provided
additional grace benefits.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are delivered from the curse of the Law. Gal. 3:13; Gal.
4:4-6.</p>
