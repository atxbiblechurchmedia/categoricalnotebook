<h2><a name="_Jesus_Christ’s_Virgin"></a><a name="_D-Jesus_Christ’s_Virgin"></a>Jesus
Christ’s Virgin Birth</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The birth of Jesus Christ was miraculous. That is, He was
born of a virgin who was conceived by the Holy Spirit. The birth of Jesus
Christ was unique. As deity, Jesus Christ could never die. As humanity, Jesus
Christ could die physically and spiritually. He died spiritually for our sins
on the Cross and once that atoning work was completed, He was allowed by God
the Father to voluntarily dismiss His human spirit, thus dying physically.
Matt. 1:18; John 19:30; Matt. 27:50.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: when His mother
Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to
be with child by the Holy Spirit.” (Matthew 1:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore when Jesus had received the sour wine, He said,
&quot;It is finished!&quot; And He bowed His head and gave up His spirit.”
(John 19:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and yielded up
His spirit.” (Matthew 27:50, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ was born sinless. His conception did not
involve promiscuity. His conception did not involve a human father who
transmits the old sin nature. Therefore, Christ was born sinless and could die
for the sins of others. This virgin birth was planned in eternity past. Matt.
1:21; Psalms 2:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;She will bear a Son; and you shall call His name Jesus,
for He will save His people from their sins.&quot;” (Matthew 1:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I will surely tell of the decree of the LORD: He said to
Me, 'You are My Son, Today I have begotten You.” (Psalms 2:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Old Testament Prophecy</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Prophesies in the Old Testament narrow down the potential
One who would die on the Cross. The Old Testament prophesies from creation to
the Cross can be seen in the diagram below. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><img width=600 height=320 id="Picture 1"
src="Jesus%20Christ’s%20Virgin%20Birth.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He would be of the human race, of the nation of Israel,
of the tribe of Judah, a Prophet like unto Moses, a King like unto David, His
birthplace would be Bethlehem, and His birth would be a virgin birth. His
names, among others are Wonderful Counsellor, the mighty God, the everlasting
Father, the Prince of Peace and finally He would die on a cross. Thus, He was
the only one qualified to be our Savior. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The birth of Jesus Christ was prophetic. Isaiah 7:14; Matt.
1:22-23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold,
a virgin will be with child and bear a son, and she will call His name
Immanuel.” (Isaiah 7:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses> “Now all this took place to fulfill what was spoken by the
Lord through the prophet: &quot;BEHOLD, THE VIRGIN SHALL BE WITH CHILD AND
SHALL BEAR A SON, AND THEY SHALL CALL HIS NAME IMMANUEL,&quot; which translated
means, &quot;GOD WITH US.&quot;” (Matthew 1:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first promise of salvation with emphasis on the
virgin birth of His true humanity is given in Genesis 3:15. The Savior’s
humanity is also mentioned in Hebrews 10:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And I will put enmity Between you and the woman, And between
your seed and her seed; He shall bruise you on the head, And you shall bruise
him on the heel.&quot;” (Genesis 3:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, when He comes into the world, He says,
&quot;SACRIFICE AND OFFERING YOU HAVE NOT DESIRED, BUT A BODY YOU HAVE PREPARED
FOR ME;” (Hebrews 10:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Christ would be of the nation of Israel. Gen. 12:1-3. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Now the LORD said to Abram, &quot;Go forth from your country,
And from your relatives And from your father's house, To the land which I will
show you; And I will make you a great nation, And I will bless you, And make
your name great; And so you shall be a blessing; And I will bless those who
bless you, And the one who curses you I will curse. And in you all the families
of the earth will be blessed.&quot;” (Genesis 12:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Christ would be of the Tribe of Judah. Gen. 49:10. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;The scepter shall not depart from Judah, Nor the ruler's
staff from between his feet, Until Shiloh comes, And to him shall be the
obedience of the peoples.” (Genesis 49:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Christ would be a Prophet like unto Moses. Deut. 18:15. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like
me from among you, from your countrymen, you shall listen to him.” (Deuteronomy
18:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Christ would be a King in the line of David. God told
David his kingdom would last forever and that His son would reign forever. 2
Sam. 7:13-16; Matt. 1:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;He shall build a house for My name, and I will establish
the throne of his kingdom forever. &quot;I will be a father to him and he will
be a son to Me; when he commits iniquity, I will correct him with the rod of
men and the strokes of the sons of men, but My lovingkindness shall not depart
from him, as I took it away from Saul, whom I removed from before you.
&quot;Your house and your kingdom shall endure before Me forever; your throne
shall be established forever.&quot;'&quot;” (2 Samuel 7:13-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen
generations; from David to the deportation to Babylon, fourteen generations;
and from the deportation to Babylon to the Messiah, fourteen generations.”
(Matthew 1:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>David was born in Bethlehem. Christ the Savior would also
be born in Bethlehem. Micah 5:2. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But as for you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, Too little to be
among the clans of Judah, From you One will go forth for Me to be ruler in
Israel. His goings forth are from long ago, From the days of eternity.&quot;”
(Micah 5:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Christ would be born of a virgin. Mary was the mother of
the humanity of Jesus Christ. Mary was not the mother of God because God has no
beginning. Isaiah 7:14; Luke 1:35.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold,
a virgin will be with child and bear a son, and she will call His name
Immanuel.” (Isaiah 7:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The angel answered and said to her, &quot;The Holy Spirit will
come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; and for that
reason the holy Child shall be called the Son of God.” (Luke 1:35, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Christ would have specific names. Isaiah 9:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us; And
the government will rest on His shoulders; And His name will be called
Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.” (Isaiah 9:6,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Christ would be born to die on a cruel cross. Isaiah 53. The
birth of Jesus Christ is a historical fact. It actually happened. This was God
revealing Himself as a member of the human race. Matt. 1:25.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but kept her a virgin until she gave birth to a Son; and he
called His name Jesus.” (Matthew 1:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Preparation For the Virgin Birth</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s great plan of redemption (from His Sovereignty) was
set into operation when Adam sinned. Throughout the Old Testament the Jews
looked forward to the coming of a Savior, as revealed through the sacrifices,
feasts, holy days, etc. Extensive preparation was made so there would be no
doubt as to who He was.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God made preparation for the virgin birth. Attacks were
made on the humanity of Jesus Christ by Satan. Christ’s birth (humanity) from
the standpoint of deity is found in Hebrews 10:1-22. Christ’s birth from the
standpoint of humanity can be found in Luke 1.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ’s humanity came from the virgin birth to
become the unique God-man in one person forever. Our Lord went back to God the
Father in resurrection and ascension. Jesus was born of the virgin Mary. Luke
2:11. Mary was the mother of the humanity of Jesus Christ, not the mother of
His deity. Mary was not the mother of God. Mary is only the mother of our
Lord’s humanity. The provision of God the Holy Spirit in the virgin birth is
given in Luke 1:35.</p>

<p class=Verses>“for today in the city of David there has been born for you a
Savior, who is Christ the Lord.” (Luke 2:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The angel answered and said to her, &quot;The Holy Spirit will
come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; and for that
reason the holy Child shall be called the Son of God.” (Luke 1:35, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ was bonafide humanity. He was born
trichotomous: body, soul and spirit just as Adam was created. The human race since
the fall of Adam is born spiritually dead, dichotomous, with no human spirit
and no ability to have fellowship with God. Rom. 1:3; Eph. 2:1; Eph. 2:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“concerning His Son, who was born of a descendant of David
according to the flesh,” (Romans 1:3, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“And you were dead in your trespasses and sins,” (Ephesians
2:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive
together with Christ (by grace you have been saved),” (Ephesians 2:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It was necessary for the humanity of Jesus Christ to have
a human spirit to understand what was the will of God for His life. He did not
have a human father, so He did not have an old sin nature.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mary was told about her miraculous pregnancy by the angel
Gabriel. Mary was reminded and she responded. Luke 1:35-38.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The angel answered and said to her, &quot;The Holy Spirit will
come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; and for that
reason the holy Child shall be called the Son of God. &quot;And behold, even
your relative Elizabeth has also conceived a son in her old age; and she who
was called barren is now in her sixth month. &quot;For nothing will be
impossible with God.&quot; And Mary said, &quot;Behold, the bondslave of the
Lord; may it be done to me according to your word.&quot; And the angel departed
from her.” (Luke 1:35-38, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God also prepared a man, Joseph, to take care of His son
while He was growing up. Matt: 1:18-25.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: when His mother
Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to
be with child by the Holy Spirit.” (Matthew 1:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But when he had considered this, behold, an angel of the Lord
appeared to him in a dream, saying, &quot;Joseph, son of David, do not be
afraid to take Mary as your wife; for the Child who has been conceived in her
is of the Holy Spirit.” (Matthew 1:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God prepared a name “Immanuel” meaning God with us. The God-man.
Isaiah 7:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold,
a virgin will be with child and bear a son, and she will call His name
Immanuel.” (Isaiah 7:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God prepared a birthplace. Mary lived in Nazareth. They
journeyed to Bethlehem. Luke 2:4-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth,
to Judea, to the city of David which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the
house and family of David, in order to register along with Mary, who was
engaged to him, and was with child.” (Luke 2:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God prepared a stable for His birth. Rev. 13:8; Luke 2:7;
Gal. 4:4-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“All who dwell on the earth will worship him, everyone whose
name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life
of the Lamb who has been slain.” (Revelation 13:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And she gave birth to her firstborn son; and she wrapped Him
in cloths, and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the
inn.” (Luke 2:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His
Son, born of a woman, born under the Law, so that He might redeem those who
were under the Law, that we might receive the adoption as sons.” (Galatians
4:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Herald of the First Advent</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When a king comes, he is always preceded by a herald. The
Lord Jesus Christ is the King of kings. John the Baptist was the herald of the
First Advent of Jesus Christ. John the Baptist preached in the wilderness of
the coming Messiah. Isaiah 40:3; Matt. 11:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“A voice is calling, “Clear the way for the LORD in the
wilderness; Make smooth in the desert a highway for our God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah
40:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“As these men were going away, Jesus began to speak to the
crowds about John, “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed
shaken by the wind?”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 11:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Matthew 11:14 says that if they receive Jesus Christ at
the First Advent, this herald (John the Baptist) will be Elijah and not John
the Baptist.</p>

<p class=Verses>““And if you are willing to accept it, John himself is Elijah
who was to come.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 11:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Elijah apparently was to be the Herald at the First
Advent, if the Jews accepted Jesus Christ as their Messiah. But if they
rejected Jesus Christ (and they did), then Elijah would be herald at the Second
Advent or our Lord’s triumphant return.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Malachi 4:5, it was announced that Elijah would come
and prepare the way for the Lord, as a herald at the Second Advent, the “day of
the Lord” indicating the possibility of rejection at the First Advent.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Behold, I am going to send you Elijah the prophet before the
coming of the great and terrible day of the LORD.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Malachi 4:5,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>John the Baptist was not Elijah and said so. John 1:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“They asked him, “What then? Are you Elijah?” And he said, “I
am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” And he answered, “No.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 1:21,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>John the Baptist as a herald has the same spirit and
power as Elijah. Luke 1:16-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>““And he will turn many of the sons of Israel back to the Lord
their God. “It is he who will go as a forerunner before Him in the spirit and
power of Elijah, TO TURN THE HEARTS OF THE FATHERS BACK TO THE CHILDREN, and
the disobedient to the attitude of the righteous, so as to make ready a people
prepared for the Lord.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Luke 1:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They rejected Jesus Christ as Messiah, therefore this
herald is John who took Elijah’s place. Matt. 17:10-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And His disciples asked Him, “Why then do the scribes say that
Elijah must come first?” And He answered and said, “Elijah is coming and will
restore all things; but I say to you that Elijah already came, and they did not
recognize him, but did to him whatever they wished. So also the Son of Man is
going to suffer at their hands.” Then the disciples understood that He had
spoken to them about John the Baptist.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 17:10-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>John said he was the herald of our Lord’s First Advent.
John 1:28-31.</p>

<p class=Verses>“These things took place in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where
John was baptizing. The next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said, “Behold,
the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world! “This is He on behalf of
whom I said, ‘After me comes a Man who has a higher rank than I, for He existed
before me.’ “I did not recognize Him, but so that He might be manifested to
Israel, I came baptizing in water.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 1:28-31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Even though God is omniscient and knew that Jesus Christ
would not be accepted at the First Advent, His perfect plan made provision for
man’s free will.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Necessity for the Virgin Birth </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Lord Jesus Christ had to be True Humanity</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Lord Jesus Christ had to be a member of the human
race in order to provide salvation for the human race. Every member of the
human race would have the opportunity of believing in the Messiah, Jesus Christ
as their Savior. As deity, He could not die. Therefore, God could not die
spiritually for the sins of mankind. Moreover, God cannot have anything to do with
sin, except to judge it. Heb. 2:9-12; John 8:58; Phil 2:5-8. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But we do see Him who was made for a little while lower than
the angels, namely, Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory
and honor, so that by the grace of God He might taste death for everyone. For
it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things, and through whom are all
things, in bringing many sons to glory, to perfect the author of their
salvation through sufferings. For both He who sanctifies and those who are
sanctified are all from one Father; for which reason He is not ashamed to call
them brethren, saying, “I WILL PROCLAIM YOUR NAME TO MY BRETHREN, IN THE MIDST
OF THE CONGREGATION I WILL SING YOUR PRAISE.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 2:9-12,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, before
Abraham was born, I am.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 8:58, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ
Jesus, who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality
with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a
bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men. Being found in appearance
as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even
death on a cross.” (Philippians 2:5-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Jesus Christ Had to Be Our Mediator Between God and
Man</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A mediator must be equal with both parties in the
mediation. Man is one party and God is the other party. Whoever mediates has to
be both God, coequal and coeternal with the Father and Holy Spirit and also
true sinless humanity. He must be equal to Adam who came into the Garden in
innocence. He could only qualify by physical birth via a unique virgin birth.
The barrier is removed by the Cross and Jesus Christ now stands as our
mediator. Job 25-53; John 1:1-5; John 1:9-14; 1 Tim. 2:5-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and
the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came into being
through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being that has come into
being. In Him was life, and the life was the Light of men. The Light shines in
the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 1:1-5,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“There was the true Light which, coming into the world,
enlightens every man. He was in the world, and the world was made through Him,
and the world did not know Him. He came to His own, and those who were His own
did not receive Him. But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to
become children of God, even to those who believe in His name, who were born,
not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.
And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory, glory as
of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John
1:9-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For there is one God, and one mediator also between God and
men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave Himself as a ransom for all, the testimony
given at the proper time.” (1 Timothy 2:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Jesus Christ Had to Be Our High Priest</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>His birth is necessary because of His priesthood. A
priest represents man before God. It is impossible for Jesus Christ to be a
high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek unless He is a man. Heb.
7:4-5; Heb. 7:14; Heb. 7:28; Heb. 10:5; Heb. 10:10-14; Heb. 5, 7, 9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now observe how great this man was to whom Abraham, the
patriarch, gave a tenth of the choicest spoils. And those indeed of the sons of
Levi who receive the priest's office have commandment in the Law to collect a
tenth from the people, that is, from their brethren, although these are
descended from Abraham.” (Hebrews 7:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, a
tribe with reference to which Moses spoke nothing concerning priests.” (Hebrews
7:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the Law appoints men as high priests who are weak, but the
word of the oath, which came after the Law, appoints a Son, made perfect
forever.” (Hebrews 7:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, when He comes into the world, He says,
&quot;SACRIFICE AND OFFERING YOU HAVE NOT DESIRED, BUT A BODY YOU HAVE PREPARED
FOR ME;” (Hebrews 10:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Jesus Christ Had to Be a King</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>His birth was necessary because as a King, He had to be a
man. Our Lord’s virgin birth would fulfill the Davidic Covenant. Mary was in
the line of David. God promised unconditionally to David that He would have a
son who would reign forever and ever, anticipation of the fulfillment at the
Second Advent. 2 Cor. 7:8-16; Psalms 39:20-37; 2 Sam. 7:17-19; 1 Chron. 21;
Matt. 27:37.</p>

<p class=Verses>“In accordance with all these words and all this vision, so
Nathan spoke to David. Then David the king went in and sat before the LORD, and
he said, &quot;Who am I, O Lord GOD, and what is my house, that You have
brought me this far? &quot;And yet this was insignificant in Your eyes, O Lord
GOD, for You have spoken also of the house of Your servant concerning the
distant future. And this is the custom of man, O Lord GOD.” (2 Samuel 7:17-19,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And above His head they put up the charge against Him which
read, &quot;THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.&quot;” (Matthew 27:37, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are two genealogies of Jesus Christ’s humanity. The
legal line through Joseph and the birth line or royal line through Mary. Both
came from David. Without the virgin birth there would be no salvation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Jesus Christ Had to Be Born Without Sin</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ had be sinless to redeem and only through
the virgin birth could He come into the human race without an old sin nature.
Since the old sin nature is passed on by the genetic father, our Lord had to be
born from a virgin birth where the Holy Spirit provided miraculously the 23
chromosomes that would have been normally provided by the genetic father.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Events Preceding the Virgin Birth</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Woman Mary </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 1:18, “when as His mother Mary” refers to the
mother of the humanity of Jesus Christ, not of His deity. His deity always
existed. She is not the mother of God. She was the mother of the humanity of
Jesus Christ, the God-man. God in His deity has no mother. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: when His mother
Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to
be with child by the Holy Spirit.” (Matthew 1:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Had been betrothed” is the aorist passive participle of <span
lang=EL>μνηστευ</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (mnēsteuō) and means engaged to
be married. The aorist refers to the point in time when they became officially
engaged. The passive voice means Joseph was the aggressor and he asked her. The
participle refers to the reality of the engagement. In Jewish society, an
engagement was treated as marriage without the physical relationship. It could
only be broken through divorce or death. The primary cause was any premarital
sexual relationship.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Man Joseph </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 1:18-19, Joseph was under pressure. He was the
Davidic heir through Koniah. Mary was the Davidic heir through Nathan. The two
surviving lines meet in this particular engagement. “She was found to be with
child by the Holy Spirit” means that she was found to be with child from the
source of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit formed the embryo in the womb of the
virgin Mary. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 1:19, “And Joseph her husband, being a
righteous man” is the present active participle of <span lang=EL>δι</span>́<span
lang=EL>καιος</span> (dikaios) and means he was born-again and a noble person.
He had character. “Not wanting to disgrace her” means that Joseph thought it
over and decided to not make it a matter of court procedure. Joseph really
loved her and he wanted to protect her! “Planned to send her away secretly”
refers to a private divorce, go to her parents and say the deal is off. Joseph
had no mental attitude sins or no bitterness here. But the dilemma is resolved.
What resolves it? The Word of God! No human solution! The dilemma will be
resolved by means of Bible doctrine. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And Joseph her husband, being a righteous man and not wanting
to disgrace her, planned to send her away secretly.” (Matthew 1:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Angelic Message </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 1:20, Joseph had thought about these things. Remember,
this was the woman he had chosen to marry. Joseph was in the line of David, so
he thought just like his great, great grandfather, David. “Do not be afraid” is
the aorist middle subjunctive of <span lang=EL>φοβε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(phobeō) and is the mood of volition. He is afraid he will lose the girl. He
just can’t piece it together. He needs information. The middle voice means that
Joseph was benefitted if he doesn’t fear. This is reflexive and means that you,
yourself should not fear. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But when he had considered this, behold, an angel of the Lord
appeared to him in a dream, saying, &quot;Joseph, son of David, do not be
afraid to take Mary as your wife; for the Child who has been conceived in her
is of the Holy Spirit.” (Matthew 1:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When you are in any kind of dilemma in life, get
information. Never take a course of action until you have assembled all relevant
facts. Do not make important decisions when you are under extreme pressure,
mental or otherwise. Of course, this doesn’t apply in the military. Knowledge
is power. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 1:21, “She will bear a Son” refers to Jesus
Christ, the Savior. “He will save His people” refers to the work of Christ on
the Cross. “From their sins” and refers to the ultimate source of their sins,
from their volition or free will. Our Lord’s atoning work on the Cross enables
them to have victory over sin. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;She will bear a Son; and you shall call His name Jesus,
for He will save His people from their sins.&quot;” (Matthew 1:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This was the fulfillment of the prophecy. In Matthew 1:22-23,
“virgin” is <span lang=EL>παρθε</span>́<span lang=EL>νος</span> (parthenos) and
is always the word for virgin and nothing else. “Emmanuel” in the Greek is the
same as “Immanuel” in Hebrew and means God with us or the God-man. Jesus Christ
is true God and true humanity in one person forever.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now all this took place to fulfill what was spoken by the Lord
through the prophet: &quot;BEHOLD, THE VIRGIN SHALL BE WITH CHILD AND SHALL
BEAR A SON, AND THEY SHALL CALL HIS NAME IMMANUEL,&quot; which translated
means, &quot;GOD WITH US.&quot;” (Matthew 1:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Obedience of Joseph </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Joseph obeyed. Joseph follows through and married Mary.
Joseph named Him Jesus. Matt. 1:24-25.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And Joseph awoke from his sleep and did as the angel of the
Lord commanded him, and took Mary as his wife, but kept her a virgin until she
gave birth to a Son; and he called His name Jesus.” (Matthew 1:24-25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>King Herod at the Time of Christ </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>King Herod at the time of Christ is described in Matthew
2:1-19. Herod was an Arab by race, but a Jew by religion. He had nine wives and
15 children. Someone said, “It is better to be Herod’s hog than to be Herod’s
son.” This was because he had several sons killed. He was a financial genius
and had a net worth of more than $100 million in today’s dollars. He built over
100 huge buildings. He had financed the Olympic games. He went broke three
times, but always regained his fortune.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He was a political genius and ruled over an extensive
empire, almost as big as Solomon had in the Old Testament. He was also a
military genius. He had fortifications on the series of mountains from northern
Syria to below Jerusalem. He built eleven new forts, four around Jerusalem. He
had a very good system of signals and communications. He reigned 39 years over
Jerusalem. He was a great athlete, a great hunter, and very handsome. In
Matthew 2, he was 68 years old and had less than two years to live.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Herod was dying and was slowly going insane. He had rapid
and wide emotional changes. He had delusions of persecution. He had
uncontrolled high blood pressure. He attempted suicide with an apple knife. His
heart and kidneys had deteriorated. He had an ulcerated mouth and foul breath.
He had constant pains in his stomach and diarrhea for the last three years of
his life. He died full of maggots. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It was during the last years of life that he murdered his
sons, one four days before he died. Shortly before his death, he killed 40
Pharisees who put the Star of David up on the Herodian Temple and he crawled
into the court and ordered five to be shot with bow and arrow, some to be
decapitated with an axe, several to be dropped into boiling oil, several were
hung, several were crucified, and others had slow torture on a rotisserie and
were roasted to death. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Herod died about two years after Christ was born after
his last infamous feat of sending a Roman army down to the Bethlehem area to
kill babies under two years old.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Wise Men </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The wise men are described in Matthew 2:l-12. Most people
have a picture of these wise men from Christmas plays where the kids, three of
them, put on someone’s bathrobe, wrapped a towel around their heads and walked
in on a cane. It is interesting that Herod could not cope with the invasion of
the Magi. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of
Herod the king, magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem, saying, &quot;Where is
He who has been born King of the Jews? For we saw His star in the east and have
come to worship Him.&quot;” (Matthew 2:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The wise men were a Gentile fraternity that started in
the time of Daniel. Daniel not only belonged to the Magi, he was the leader of
them. Daniel was the only Jew who was ever a member. Actually Nebuchadnezzar
made Daniel a Gentile, Belteshazzar. Dan. 2:48.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the king promoted Daniel and gave him many great gifts,
and he made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and chief prefect over
all the wise men of Babylon.” (Daniel 2:48, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The wise men were remembered for being wise scholars.
They were chemists and knew more about it than anyone else. They were also physicians.
They were also the greatest mathematicians outside the Greeks. They were
theologians and a great number were believers. But they were known and
remembered for their astronomy, knowledge of the stars, not astrology.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The wise men numbered around 50-100, sometimes in history
they numbered 200. They had three leaders. History has recorded the names of
the three leaders. This is where we get the number of wise men plus the three
categories of gifts although many more were there.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They were entertained by Herod. When these strange
Eastern men walked in, they were welcome wherever they went. This was a
well-known fraternity that had survived the rise and fall of many empires such
as the Babylonians, Greeks, Media-Persia, and the Roman Empire. Remember, Herod
was not born king of the Jews. He fought and schemed to be the king. Herod
realized that he was finished if this new king survived. Matt. 2:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we
saw His star in the east and have come to worship Him.&quot;” (Matthew 2:2,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 2:2, “we saw His star” refers to the star as a
part of prophecy. Uniquely, one of the names for Jesus Christ is Star. The wise
men were born-again and had seen the star and came to worship the object of the
star, the Star, the Lord Jesus Christ. They had come to worship Him. Num.
24:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not near; A
star shall come forth from Jacob, A scepter shall rise from Israel, And shall
crush through the forehead of Moab, And tear down all the sons of Sheth.”
(Numbers 24:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 2:9-10, “When they saw the star, they rejoiced
exceedingly with great joy” means that the star illustrates the ability of
light to shine in darkness. The star illustrates the ability of light to guide
those with positive volition. We are said to be stars reflecting His glory now
and forever. Dan. 12:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“After hearing the king, they went their way; and the star,
which they had seen in the east, went on before them until it came and stood
over the place where the Child was. When they saw the star, they rejoiced
exceedingly with great joy.” (Matthew 2:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Those who have insight will shine brightly like the
brightness of the expanse of heaven, and those who lead the many to
righteousness, like the stars forever and ever.” (Daniel 12:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Christmas Story</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Christmas story illustrates the principle of negative
volition of Herod. He had rejected the Gospel and he rejected the Lord Jesus
Christ. He was troubled. He was a liar. He was a murderer. Matt. 2:3; Matt. 2:8;
Matt. 2:13; Matt. 2:16. </p>

<p class=Verses>“When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all
Jerusalem with him.” (Matthew 2:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, &quot;Go and search
carefully for the Child; and when you have found Him, report to me, so that I
too may come and worship Him.&quot;” (Matthew 2:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now when they had gone, behold, an angel of the Lord *appeared
to Joseph in a dream and said, &quot;Get up! Take the Child and His mother and
flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you; for Herod is going to search
for the Child to destroy Him.&quot;” (Matthew 2:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then when Herod saw that he had been tricked by the magi, he
became very enraged, and sent and slew all the male children who were in
Bethlehem and all its vicinity, from two years old and under, according to the
time which he had determined from the magi.” (Matthew 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Christmas story illustrates the principle of positive
volition of the wise men. They were seeking and were wanting to worship. They
had more light revealed to them. They were full of joy. Matt. 2:2; Matt 2:9; Matt.
2:10. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we
saw His star in the east and have come to worship Him.&quot;” (Matthew 2:2,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“After hearing the king, they went their way; and the star,
which they had seen in the east, went on before them until it came and stood
over the place where the Child was.” (Matthew 2:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great
joy.” (Matthew 2:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They gave of their substance. They obeyed the Word of
God. What a contrast with Herod. Matt. 2:11; Matt. 2:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“After coming into the house they saw the Child with Mary His
mother; and they fell to the ground and worshiped Him. Then, opening their
treasures, they presented to Him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.”
(Matthew 2:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And having been warned by God in a dream not to return to
Herod, the magi left for their own country by another way.” (Matthew 2:12,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Christmas story illustrates the principle of
testimony, of witnessing the Star. We have four uses of the term star in the
Word of God - stars in the sky, angels are called stars, the star of the East,
believers are called stars in Daniel 12:3, and The Star, Jesus Christ. Matt. 2;
Num. 24:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Those who have insight will shine brightly like the
brightness of the expanse of heaven, and those who lead the many to
righteousness, like the stars forever and ever.” (Daniel 12:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not near; A
star shall come forth from Jacob, A scepter shall rise from Israel, And shall
crush through the forehead of Moab, And tear down all the sons of Sheth.”
(Numbers 24:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Today, we celebrate the birthday of Jesus Christ on
December 25th. There is some question that December 25th is the exact day of
His birth, no matter, the fact is, that He was born. Today we are not looking
at a baby in a manger. We are not dealing with a bouncing baby boy whom the
commercial world can quite easily dismiss with pageantry and tradition. We are
dealing with the resurrected, ascended Christ, seated at the right hand of God
the Father. We celebrate the birthday of Jesus Christ as our Savior, our
Sovereign, and as our Sustainer.</p>
