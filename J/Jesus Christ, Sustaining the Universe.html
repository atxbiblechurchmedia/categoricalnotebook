<h2>Jesus Christ, Sustaining the Universe</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The continuation of the universe depends upon the omnipotence
and immutability of Jesus Christ. The so-called scientific laws such as the law
of gravity, etc. cannot be enforced by science. These “laws” are based on a
statistical assumption that the universe, which operates according to a fixed
norm, will continue to do so. Science cannot guarantee this. The universe, with
its laws of matter and energy will not always exist. 2 Peter 3:1-12; Rev.
20:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But by His word the present heavens and earth are being
reserved for fire, kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly
men.” (2 Peter 3:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, in which the
heavens will pass away with a roar and the elements will be destroyed with
intense heat, and the earth and its works will be burned up.” (2 Peter 3:10,
NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat upon it, from
whose presence earth and heaven fled away, and no place was found for them.”
(Revelation 20:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Known “scientific laws’ depend entirely upon the
omnipotence and immutability of God the Son. Every text on the pattern of the
universe is a treatise of the faithfulness of Jesus Christ, who holds
everything together. Col. 1:16-18. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For by Him all things were created, both in the heavens and on
earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or
authorities—all things have been created through Him and for Him. He is before
all things, and in Him all things hold together. He is also head of the body,
the church; and He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that He
Himself will come to have first place in everything.” (Colossians 1:16-18,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ not only holds the universe together, but He
does so mechanically by the word that He utters. Heb. 1:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He is the radiance of His glory and the exact
representation of His nature, and upholds all things by the word of His power.
When He had made purification of sins, He sat down at the right hand of the
Majesty on high,” (Hebrews 1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>His reason for holding the universe together is to bring
many sons into glory. Heb. 2:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things, and
through whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to perfect the
author of their salvation through sufferings.” (Hebrews 2:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is holding the universe together to allow God's
grace plan to run its full course. The laws of the universe simply define His
faithfulness in time.</p>
