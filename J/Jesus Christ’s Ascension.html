<h2>Jesus Christ’s Ascension</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The ascension of Jesus Christ is a central doctrine in
the Angelic Conflict. Without it, there would be no positional truth for believers.
Acts 1:7-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He said to them, “It is not for you to know times or epochs
which the Father has fixed by His own authority; but you will receive power
when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be My witnesses both in
Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and even to the remotest part of the
earth.” And after He had said these things, He was lifted up while they were
looking on, and a cloud received Him out of their sight. And as they were
gazing intently into the sky while He was going, behold, two men in white
clothing stood beside them. They also said, “Men of Galilee, why do you stand
looking into the sky? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven,
will come in just the same way as you have watched Him go into heaven.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts
1:7-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There was no indwelling ministry of the Holy Spirit for
believers until the ascension of Jesus Christ. Acts 1:1-2; 1 Cor. 12:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The first account I composed, Theophilus, about all that Jesus
began to do and teach, until the day when He was taken up to heaven, after He
had by the Holy Spirit given orders to the apostles whom He had chosen.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts
1:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether
Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one
Spirit.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 12:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There was no priesthood among believers without the
ascended High-Priest. This is the whole context of the book of Hebrews. Heb.
1:3; Heb. 1:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He is the radiance of His glory and the exact
representation of His nature, and upholds all things by the word of His power.
When He had made purification of sins, He sat down at the right hand of the
Majesty on high,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But to which of the angels has He ever said, “SIT AT MY RIGHT
HAND, UNTIL I MAKE YOUR ENEMIES A FOOTSTOOL FOR YOUR FEET”?”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews
1:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is impossible to have a mediator without the ascension.
God the Father accepted the resurrected humanity of Jesus Christ and we accept
Jesus Christ as our Mediator and Savior. 1 Tim. 2:5; Job 9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For there is one God, and one mediator also between God and
men, the man Christ Jesus,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Timothy 2:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ would not be our advocate without the ascension,
nor could He intercede for us. 1 John 2:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“My little children, I am writing these things to you so that
you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus
Christ the righteous; and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins; and not
for ours only, but also for those of the whole world.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 John
2:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There would be no Church, no Rapture, and no Second
Advent without the ascension. The ascension is a central doctrine in the whole
plan of God. </p>
