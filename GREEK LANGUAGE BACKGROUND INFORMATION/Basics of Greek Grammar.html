<h2>Basics of Greek Grammar</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>10 Basic Necessities for Good Translation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1. Understanding the flow of thought in the sentence. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>2. Understanding the Forms of nouns, verbs, pronouns,
participles, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>3. Understanding the Principle Parts of Verbs. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>4. Understanding the Basic Case and Tense Variations.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>5. Understanding Etymology and the Contextual Influence
on it.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>6. Understanding Hermeneutics: the Principles of Correct
Interpretation</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>7. Understanding the Process of Research Study involving
Isagogics, Chronology, Doctrine, and Categories.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>8. Understanding the context Doctrinally: The context
will determine: Specific case functions, Specific tense functions, and Specific
participle functions.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>9. Understanding English vocabulary and idiom: One must
know how to represent in English the same sentence structure, the same point of
emphasis, the same tone of intensity, to rightly convey the accurate
translation of the text.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>10. Understanding of the Principles of Textual Criticism:
both the Internal and the external.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Definite Article </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The meaning or translation of the definite article in its
normal usage is rendered by the word, “the.” Forms are Masculine, Feminine, and
Neuter.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Vowels</b><b> </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Given with their English equivalents: </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1. <span lang=EL>α</span>:  a</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>2. <span lang=EL>ε</span>:  short e</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>3. <span lang=EL>η</span>:  long e but pronounced like “
a” as in late</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>4. <span lang=EL>ο</span>:  short “o”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>5. <span lang=EL>ι</span>:  i</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>6. <span lang=EL>υ</span>:  u</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>7. <span lang=EL>ω</span>:  long “o”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Of these vowels, <span lang=EL>ε</span> and <span
lang=EL>ο</span> are always short; <span lang=EL>η</span> and <span lang=EL>ω</span>
are always long; <span lang=EL>α</span>, <span lang=EL>ι</span><span lang=EL> </span>and
 <span lang=EL>υ</span> may be long or short, only by observation will you be
able to determine the tone quality of  <span lang=EL>α</span>, <span lang=EL>ι</span>
and <span lang=EL>υ</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Diphthongs </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Two vowel sounds fused into one sound. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EL>αι</span> =  ai as in aisle</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EL>αυ</span>  =  au as in kraut</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EL>ει</span>  =  ei as in height</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EL>οι</span>  =  oi as in oil</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EL>ευ</span>  =  eu as in feud</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EL>ηυ</span>  =  approximately the same sound
as <span lang=EL>ευ</span><span lang=EL> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EL>υι</span>  =  pronounced like whee</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Breathing Marks </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every Greek word beginning with a vowel or a diphthong
must have a breathing mark. There are two breathing marks in Greek: Smooth
Breathing and Rough Breathing.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Accent Marks</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are three accent marks in Greek. It is not
necessary to know the accent marks to read, translate, and interpret Greek.
They do aid in the pronunciation. The accent stands over the vowel of the
accented syllable and in a diphthong over the second vowel. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The last syllable of a word is called the ultima. The
next to the last syllable is called the penult. The one before the penult is
called the antepenult. In pronunciation, stress the accent, as in English.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Definitions and Distinctions</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Verbs Have: Tense, Voice, Mood, Person and Number, and
Etymology. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Verbs Are: Conjugated and Parsed.  Conjugation means the
listing of the Forms of Verbs as to Tense, Voice, or Mood with all 3 persons
given in Sing, and Plural.  Parsing means to determine the above factors for an
existing single verb occurring in the text.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Nouns Have: Case, Gender, or Number. The case provides
the function, number, and gender of the noun. The gender is Masculine,
Feminine, or Neuter. The number is Singular or Plural.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Nouns Are: Declined or fall into a Declension.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Where Declension provides the form of a noun, Case
provides the function of the noun.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Case: The case has a Name: Nominative, Genitive,
Ablative, Dative, Locative, or Instrumental.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The case has a Form: The forms united or listed is called
a Declension.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The case has a Function: Each case contributes a function
to the noun found in that case.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Gender: It may be Masculine. It may be Feminine. It
may be Neuter.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Verbs and Nouns Compared:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Conjugation gives the FORM of the verb. Declension gives
the FORM of the noun. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Tense, Voice, and Mood give the Function of the Verb.
Case, Gender, and Number give the Function of the Noun.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Nouns May Be: Articular: having the definite article with
them. Anartharous: having no article with them.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Articular Nouns emphasize the Identity of the person or
thing. Anartharous Nouns emphasize the Quality of the person or thing.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Four-Fold Navigational Fix of the Verb </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Tense, Voice, Mood, and Etymology pinpoint the Bible
interpretation of a Verb. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Verb Tenses </b></p>

action.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Verb Perfect Tense </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Definition: The perfect tense denotes One, Completed
action: and secondly, Existing Results from that completed action. Completed
action of the verb with present continuing effects. Eph. 2:8-9 “For by grace
are you saved . . .” (Present perfect).</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Types of the Perfect Tense: </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>The Intensive
Perfect: The major significance of the Perfect Tense is shown here with
emphasis on the Existing Results. Rom 14:23.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>The
Consummative Perfect: The usage which emphasizes the Consummated process of the
action of the verb. Acts 5:28.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>The Iterative
Perfect: This usage emphasizes that the process of the action was that of
recurrent interval action. The process is the main idea here. John 1:18.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>The Dramatic
Perfect: This usage emphasizes the results of the action, but likewise calls
attention to the vivid and realistic description of the fact, Matt 13:46.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Verb Pluperfect Tense </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is the tense which indicates the Perfect Indicative
of past time, action being completed with results already in existence at some
past point in time. “The children had washed their hands before they ate supper
last night.” John 19:22. “…what I have written, I have written.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Intensive
Pluperfect: Emphasis on the existing results. Acts 1:10.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Consummative
Pluperfect: Emphasis on action as a process completed. John 9:22.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Verb Voice </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This relates the action of the verb to the subject of the
sentence as to its involvement in the action. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Active Voice: The subject produces the action of the
verb. Acts 16:31, “Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved.”
Believe is active - you must believe, you must initiate the action of believing
by faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Passive Voice: The subject receives the action of the
main verb. The voice of grace. Eph. 2:8 “By grace are ye saved.” When you
believe (active voice), you receive salvation (passive voice).</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Middle Voice: The subject is benefitted by the action of
the main verb. John 15:16, “Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you.” (I
have chosen you for my benefit). The action of the verb related to reality. Is
this happening? The attitude of the speaker or writer towards reality. The four
moods show the way an action is to be regarded - as a fact, command, wish, or
potential action.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Indicative: Declarative, Interrogative, Cohortative, and
Potential. Action which is reality or assumed reality. The mood of reality. It
means the event  actually occurred as indicated. This is a simple assertion or
statement, or asks a simple question. This is the most commonly used mood. “In
the beginning was the Word.” John 1:1.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Subjunctive: Hortatory, Prohibition, Deliberative,
Emphatic Negation, Potential, and Probable F. Condition. Action which is
Potential or Probable reality. Potential mood. It could happen potentially.
John 14:31, “Let us be going.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Imperative: Command, Prohibition, Entreaty, and
Permission. Action which is Commanded or Commanded reality. The mood of command.
“Keep on doing this in remembrance of me.” 1 Cor. 11:24. “Love your enemies.”
Matt. 5:44.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Optative: Voluntative (wish), Potential (implied
condition), and Deliberative (doubtful). Action desired to happen, but remotely
possible, or remote possible reality. Expresses a wish. 2 Thess. 3:5, “May the
Lord guide your hearts.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Etymology: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is the true meaning of a word based on how it was
used at the time in which it was written, depending upon its use historically.
Etymology is related to isagogics or historical background.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Eph. 4:14. (English): “That we henceforth be no more
children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by
the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to
deceive.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Eph. 4:14 (Greek, partial translation) “If you don’t know
doctrine as a Christian, it’s like shooting craps with the devil, and the devil
has loaded the dice so the odds are against you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Verb Moods</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Definition of Mood: The action of the verb as it relates
to reality. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Classifications of Moods: </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Indicative
Mood: Reality or Assumed Reality. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Declarative
Indicative: Statement of simple fact. John 1:1. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Interrogative
Indicative: Reality implied in a simple question. John l:38. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Cohortative
Indicative: The future indicative expresses a command. John 2:8. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Potential
Indicative: Used in a claim of obligation, Acts 24:19. Used to express an
impulse, Rom. 9:3. Used in certain forms of conditions (2nd class), Gal. 4:15;
John 11:21.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Subjunctive Mood: Possible Reality.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Hortatory
Subjunctive: used of first person plural to exhort them to join in on an
action, Heb. 4:15.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Subjunctive of
Prohibition: second person aor. subj. - prohibition to certain action, or

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Infinitives </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Infinitives are verbal nouns. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As a Verb: As a verb, it has a subject expressed or
understood, it may have an object, it is qualified by adverbs, and has tense
and voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As a Noun: As a noun, it may stand as the subject or
object of another verb. Its case is shown by the case of the article, for the
infinitive itself cannot have inflections. The tense has its significance in
the kind of action. The infinitive may be separated from its article by other
words.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It’s simple form <span lang=EL>λύειν</span>  Present
Active Infinitive and is translated “to be losing.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Conjugation of Verbs </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Conjugation: This is the word which means the listing of
a set of verbal forms in the singular and plural for a given tense or mood.
This involves the forms for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd persons in Singular and Plural
and with each mood having its own set.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Parsing: This means identifying a certain verb in the
text as to tense, voice, mood, person and number.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Relationship of the Tenses to Time: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Besides the context there is one grammatical help in
determining the time of a tense. This is the contribution of the Mood meaning
to the tense. For example: if you had </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>A Present
Active Indicative, the time factor is usually “now.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>An Imperfect
Active Indicative, the time factor is past in time. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>If you have
Aorist Active Subjunctive, you have future in time. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>An Aorist
Imperative could be “Right now” or future in time.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Present
Imperative would usually mean “do it now.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>So the mood, whether Indicative, Subjunctive, Imperative,
or Optative will give direction as to whether the kind of action is past,
present or future in time.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Participles</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Definition: The participle is a Verbal Adjective. It
modifies a noun for example by setting forth a characteristic of the noun. As a
verb it has tense and voice with emphasis on the “action” that is related to
the noun.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Adjectival Participle: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Adjectival Participles: Ascriptive Adjective: Ascribes a
quality, fact, or characteristic to the noun it modifies. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Restrictive: Distinguishes a noun from something else. 
Occurs with the Greek definite article. This is one factor which helps in
recognizing an Adjectival Participle.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Adverbial Participles: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Telic Participle: This denotes the Purpose. Matt. 27:49.</p>

after, while). Matt. 2:10.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Conditional Participle: “Used as the if clause in a
Conditional sentence.” Acts 15:29.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Causal Part: Denotes the “grounds” for the action of the
verb. John 4:45. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Concessive Part: It denotes a sense of Concession. Rom.
5:10. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Instrumental Part: It denotes the means by which the
action of the verb was completed. Acts 16:16. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Modal Part: The manner in which the action of the verb is
accomplished. Matt. 3:1.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Complementary Part: The participle may be used to
complete the idea of action expressed in the main verb. Eph. 1:16. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Circumstantial Part; Denoting an attendant circumstance
which completes the idea of the main verb. Mark 16:20. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Participle Used as an Imperative: Similar to the
hortatory subj. mood. Participle used as an imperative. 1 Peter 3:1.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Tense of the Greek Participle: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Antecedent (previous) action relative to the main verb is
usually found in the Aorist and Perfect tense. Exceptions: Matt. 22:1; Heb.
9:12; Acts 4:32. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Simultaneous action is ordinarily expressed by the
Present tense (while). 1 Tim. 4:8. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Subsequent action relative to the main verb is regularly
expressed by the Future tense. Heb. 3:5. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Negative Pronouns: <span lang=EL>ουδεις</span>,
meaning: no one, indicative. <span lang=EL>μηδεις</span>, meaning; no one,
subjunctive.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Pronouns are declined like a noun; they have case
function, may be masculine, feminine, or neuter. May be indicative or
subjunctive as to the Negative Pronoun. The above forms are the Nominative case
and on some the Genitive case.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Declensions</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Participles </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Definition of Participle: A Participle is a Verbal
Adjective which can show: A Verbal usage: Participle used as a Verb. Adjectival
usage: Participle used as an Adjective or Noun. Participles share the
characteristics both of verbs and adjectives.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Function of Participles: The Participle in general shows
a Principle or rule of practice. If the Participle is Adverbial it shows a
Principle of Action. If the Participle is Adjectival it shows a Characteristic
of the Person or thing.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As a verb, a participle has: Tense form and meaning.
Voice form and meaning. Possible meaning as a Modifier.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As an Adjective it has: Case meaning. Gender: either
masculine, feminine, or neuter. May be used as a Substantive. May be used to
Modify a noun or other adjective.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Its Voice Function: basically the same as the Voice
function of a verb.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Tenses of the Participle: Kind of action--point,
completed, continuous. Present, Aorist, Future, and Perfect.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Time of the Participle: Antecedent (previous) to
action of main verb: normally aor. &amp; perf. Simultaneous to the Action of
the main verb: Present. Subsequent (after) the action of the main verb: Future.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Identifying the Participle: If it be Adjectival, it is
accompanied by the definite article: <span lang=EL>ο</span>̔. If Adverbial, it
is not accompanied by the article: (-) part.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Kinds of Adjectival Participles: Ascriptive: ascribing a
quality to the noun it is modifying. Restrictive: restricting the noun to its
particular point in the participle.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Kinds of Adverbial Participles:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Telic: denotes
Purpose. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Temporal:
denotes Time. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Conditional:
denotes a Condition Present.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Causal:
contains Grounds for Action of Verb.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Concessive:
denotes Concession. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Instrumental:
denotes Means of Action of Verb. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Modal: denotes
Manner of Action Performed. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Complementary:

denotes Surroundings in which Action of Verb is Done.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Imperative:
denotes Participle Expressing a Command. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Prepositions</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Prepositions are adverbs specialized to define more
clearly the meanings of cases, many of which come to be used in composition
with verbs:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A preposition may stand alone. Like <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span
lang=EL>κ</span> in 1 Cor 7:7.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It may intensify the action of the verb. Like <span
lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>κβα</span>́<span lang=EL>λλω</span> in Gal 4:30 </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It may change the meaning of the verb and blend with it.
Like <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>ναγιγνώσκω</span> in Matt 24:15. <span
lang=EL>γιγνώσκω</span> alone is “I know.” <span lang=EL>α</span>̓́<span
lang=EL>να</span> added means “I read.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Adverbs</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Definition: Adverbs are words that help define or show
relationship of time, place, manner, or degree.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Formation of the Adverb: Usually accomplished by
substituting the  <span lang=EL>σ</span><span lang=EL> </span> of the Gen.
Plural for the  <span lang=EL>ν</span>. Thus <span lang=EL>καλος</span><span
lang=EL> </span>(singular) becomes <span lang=EL>καλώς</span> (plural).</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Adverbs formed
by putting a neuter word in the accusative:<span lang=EL>περαν</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Adverbs formed
by combining the article and neuter adjective: <span lang=EL>το</span><span
lang=EL> </span><span lang=EL>λοιπον</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Adverbs formed
by adding suffix endings. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Degrees of the Adverb:</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Positive Adverb: Stating a simple characteristic,
normally suffix <span lang=EL>ως</span>, or <span lang=EL>ω</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Comparative Adverb: Stating a characteristic of
Comparison (smaller, larger, greater, etc.) with suffix endings: <span lang=EL>τερον</span><span
lang=EL> </span>and <span lang=EL>τερω</span>, <span lang=EL>ον</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Superlative; Stating a characteristic that is ultimate
(greatest, smallest, farthest, etc.) with suffix endings: <span lang=EL>τατα</span>,
<span lang=EL>τατω</span>, <span lang=EL>ιστα</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Adverbs Used as Prefixes: <span lang=EL>αν</span> meaning
difficulty; <span lang=EL>δυσ</span> meaning un or without, <span lang=EL>ευ</span>
meaning well or good.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Conditional Sentences or Clauses</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Definition of Conditional Clauses (1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th
class conditions) </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Academic Definition: Conditional sentences contain a
subordinate clause which states a supposition and a principle clause which
states the result of the fulfillment of this supposition. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The subordinate (if) clause is called the protasis. The
principle clause (conclusion) is called the apodisis. Example: “If you study
hard (if clause), you will get a good grade (conclusion clause).” Either clause
may come first in the sentence. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>First Class: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first class condition affirms the reality of the
condition. Fact. Assumed fact. Assumed fact for debater’s technique. Assumed to
be true: Simple Condition. It is expressed by <span lang=EL>ει</span> with the
indicative mood in the protasis (if clause) and almost any mood or tense in the
apodosis (main or fulfilment clause). “If we are disciples of the Lord, we
shall be saved.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This construction confirms the condition and is best
translated, “Since we are disciples of the Lord, we shall be saved.” “If ye
then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above.” Col. 3:1 Assumed
to be true, “Since you were risen with Christ (aorist passive indicative). Examples:
Gal. 5:18, Matt. 4:3, John 14:7, and John 15:8.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Second Class: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This condition is contrary to fact in both protasis and
apodosis. The statement is assumed to be false.  Luke 7:39 (if it’s true, but
it’s not). May or may not have “an” in the apodosis. Will occur with past
tenses, usually imperfect or aorist or a combination. This is the hardest
conditional clause to understand. These English sentences illustrate it. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If I were you, I would not go. If you were older, you
would understand. If this were Sunday, I would be at church. If he had left
yesterday, he would be here today. I wish my father were here (but he is not).</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Third Class: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This condition expresses possibility. May be true or
false; a probability. This is the volitional clause, used with the subjunctive
mood. The statement may be true or false depending upon the condition. In 1
John 1:9, maybe he will confess sin biblically (the believer) may be will not,
but if he does, God cleanses, forgives, and removes all unrighteousness.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Fourth Class: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This conditional clause has very remote, if any,
possibility. 1 Peter 3:14, 1 Cor. 14:10, 1 Cor. 15:37 (if it’s true, but it probably
is not).</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The form of the condition has only to do with the way the
writer or speaker views the statement. What is stated as truth may actually be
untrue. Peter said in Mark 14:31 that he would die before he would deny
Christ...he regarded this statement as true, but it wasn’t.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Mixed
conditions: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One clause
belongs to one class condition and the other clause to another class condition.
Luke 17:6</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Implied
condition: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The apodosis is
expressed and the protasis is implied in the participle. 1 Tim. 4:4</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Elliptical
condition: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A conditional
sentence from which one member has been entirely omitted and must be supplied
from the context. Luke 13:9</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Concessive
conditions: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is a
regular simple condition with the addition of “kai.” The “if” clause would
begin...even if, if also, although.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b><span style='color:windowtext'>Noun</span> Cases</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Nominative</u>: </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Definition: The nominative case is basically the case of designation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Types of variation with the Nominative Case. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Subject
Nominative: The normal use of the nominative which identifies the subject of
the sentence. John 3:35.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Predicate
Nominative: The nominative occurring in the predicate position makes that noun
that which the sentence is defining. 1 Thess. 2:20.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Nominative of
Appellation: This is the putting of proper names in the nominative case as an
apposition to another verb or noun. Luke 19:29.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>The Independent
Nominative: This is the use of the nominative case when an idea is expressed
that has no verbal connecting in the sentence. Luke 21:6.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Nominative of
Exclamation: When an idea of great distinctness is desired, the nominative case
is used without a verb. Such as, “Water!!”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Genitive</u>:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Definition: The genitive case is a case of description or
definition.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Types of Variation within the genitive case. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Genitive of
Description: the basic root meaning of the genitive is to describe. Mark 1:4.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Genitive of
Possession: One of the most prevalent uses of the genitive is that the
descriptive quality shows “ownership.” Luke 5:3. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Genitive of
Relationship: This is the use of the genitive to show relationship of the noun
to another in a marital relationship. Such as; a son, daughter, father, in
which the noun does not appear, only its attending proper article. Acts 16:22. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Adverbial
Genitive: The use of the genitive which gives local or temporal relations to
the noun. Genitive of Time: John 3:2. Genitive of Place: Luke 16:24.  Genitive
of Reference: Heb. 3:12.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>The Genitive
with Nouns of Action: Noun in genitive indicates the person, place, or thing to
which the action is referred. Rom. 16.25. The Subjective Genitive. The
Objective Genitive.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Genitive of
Apposition: This is taking a noun with meaning of a general nature and putting
it in the genitive and giving it a unique, specific meaning. John 2:31.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Partitive
Genitive: A noun may be defined by indicating in the genitive the person, place
or thing of which it is a part. Mark 6:23.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Genitive
Absolute: A noun or participle in the genitive case not grammatically connected
to the main sentence is called a Genitive Absolute. Matt. 9:33.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Ablative Case</u>: </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Definition: The basic significance of the Ablative case
is the point of departure. It emphasizes the concept of separation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Types of variations of the Ablative Case: </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>The Ablative of
Separation: This is the Ablative in its basic usage with no other associated
ideas. Eph. 2:12. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>The Ablative of
Source: The noun modified by the Ablative owes its present characteristic to
origination in the Ablative. Example: “Through the consolation (from) the
Scriptures.” The noun, Consolation, owes its source and character to the
Scriptures which has the Ablative form. Rom. 15:4. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Ablative of
Means: The ablative of means is used when the means is related by implication
of origin or source. Acts 20:37. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>The Ablative of
Comparison: The noun in Ablative of Comparison emphasizes separation when two
things are compared. Mark 12:28.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Dative Case</u>:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Definition: The Dative Case is the case of person
interest. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Types of Variations of the Dative Case:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>The Dative of
Indirect Object. This is the basic root idea of the Dative. It indicates the
one for whom or to whom the action of the verb is performed. Matt. 18:26. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>The Dative of
Advantage or Disadvantage: This is the use of the Dative which emphasizes that
the action is to the advantage of the one receiving it. 2 Cor. 2:1.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>The Dative of
Possession: This is a further development of the first two phrases. Example: “He
gave the book to me,” The Dative of Possession emphasizes that it is now mine.”
No. 1 emphasizes the giving was in my interest; No. 2 that it is an advantage
and No. 3 it is my property. Luke 4:16.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>The Dative of
Reference: The Dative of Reference is usually used in showing a diminished idea
of Interest when things are referred to rather than people. Rom. 6:2.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Locative Case</u>: </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Definition: The Locative Case designates a “point within
limits set by the word and context.” It is the case of position.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Types of Variation of the Locative Case:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>The Locative of
Place. John 21:8. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>The Locative of
Time. Matt. 20:19. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>The Locative of
Sphere. (Limits are logical rather than spatial) Heb. 5:11.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Instrumental Case</u>: </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Definition: The function of the Instrumental Case, with
its root idea is means.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Types of Instrumental Case. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in'>The Instrumental of Means: The
instrumental case is used to express the impersonal means. Personal means is
expressed by the preposition <span lang=EL>υ</span>̔<span lang=EL>πο</span>́
(hupo) with the ablative.) Matt. 8:16.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>The Instrument
of Cause: This is the use of the Instrumental case when the original cause is
meant. “He was killed by the flood.” Heb. 2:15.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>The
Instrumental of Method: This is the use of the instrumental case when the method
of the action is emphasized. 1 Cor. 11:5</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>The
Instrumental of Measure: This is the use of the Instrumental case which
measures the extent of the action of the instrument. Acts 8:11.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>The
Instrumental of Association: This is the use of the Instrumental case in which
a second party furnishes the means of Association. Mark 14:51.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Accusative Case</u>: </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Definition: The root meaning of the accusative case
embraces the ideas of the end, or direction, or limitation of motion or action.
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Types of Variations of the Accusative Case: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Accusative of Direct Object: It is used when a noun
receives the action of the verb. Usually a transitive verb. “He sings songs.” John
8:46.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Adverbial Accusative: This usage limits the action of
the verb by a fact rather than a person or thing. It has three expressions: Of
Measure, Luke 22:41; Of Manner (How), Matt. 10:8; Of Reference, Rom. 16:6. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Cognate Accusative: When an accusative of Direct
Object has within it the same idea as the action of the verb it is a Cognate
Accusative. 2 Tim. 4:7.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Double Accusative: This is used when a verb requires
more than one object to complete its meaning. This usage is the Double
Accusative. John 14:26. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Accusative Absolute; This is the usage of the
Accusative when as a noun with or without a participle it is set off from the
main part of the sentence with no grammatical connection, Acts 26:.3</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Accusative with Oaths: The oath, I adjure, is usually
followed by two accusatives. Mark 5:7 (English prep. by understood).</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Articles</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Form: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Declined like a noun, having a form for each case, gender
and number. Agrees with the noun it accompanies in case and gender, and number.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Function: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Basic Function; The Basic function of the Article is to
point out “individual Identity.” The Presence of the Article emphasizes the
Identity of the noun. The Absence emphasizes the quality of the noun. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Regular Uses of the Article: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To Denote Individuals--point out a particular person,
place or thing; Matt 3:3. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To Denote Previous Reference--identifies a previously
states noun in its context when accompanying a repetition of that noun later, John
4:11. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>With Abstract Nouns--the use of the Article with an
abstract noun, such as truth, brings it from the general sense to the specific
sense, Eph. 2:8. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Used with Proper Names--it is used with proper names to
emphasize the “particular” person, Acts 19:13.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Generic Use--this is used with a noun regarded as a
classification of things, people, Matt. 8:20. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>With Pronouns--the article will affect certain nouns such
as . </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Articles with an Expression--to identify individuality is
desired, the article is then used, Luke 5:10.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Special Uses of the Article: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Nouns connected by και. Article precedes first
noun--makes both nouns the same. Article precedes second noun--makes both nouns
separate. 2 Peter 2:20. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As a Pronoun. Demonstrative--the article may have the
full force of the demonstrative (those), Gal 5.24. Used with μεν and δε as
alternate pronoun, Acts l7:32. Possessive Pronoun, Matt. 8:3. Relative pronoun
-- repetition of the article with some word or phrase, used as mild relative.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>With Subject in a Copulative sentence--the article
distinguishes the subject from the predicate, John 1:1.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Position of the Article</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Before the Adjective - Attributive Position. Matt. 12:43.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Absent before the Adjective - Predicate Position. 1 Cor.
5:6.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Article before both Noun and Article - distributes
identity equally between the two. 1 John 10:11.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Participle with Article - Attributive, Quality of the
Noun.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Participle without Article – Predicate, Temporal concept.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Infinitive with preposition - always has an article.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Infinitive with Article - helps sustain substantive force
of infinitive.</p>
