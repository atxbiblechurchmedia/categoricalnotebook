<h2>Koine Greek Language Background</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the central and southern part of ancient Greece, three
city-states (Athens, Thebes and Sparta) were fighting to gain the ascendancy
over the entire peninsula. This fighting had been going on for several hundred
years. Following the Peloponnesian Wars, the Corinthian War (395 - 387 BC), resulted
in Sparta gaining predominance over Athens and its allies. In the
Theban–Spartan War (378–362 BC), Sparta finally lost its predominance to Thebes
when Epaminondas, a genius general and statesman became ruler of Thebes. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the key battle when the Thebans became the dominant
power in southern Greece, there was a man observing the battle who became very
interested in the tactics of the Theban army. His name was Philip. His father
was the ruler of a group of mountain people who lived to the north. He was in
the Theban city because he was a hostage. His father had a tendency to come
down out of the hills and raid in southern Greece. And in order to make the
father behave, the boy was taken into custody for a while. During this time,
the boy observed many of the unusual things that the Thebans had developed
under Epaminondas. Among other things, he was quite fascinated by a battle
called Leuctra in which a smaller Theban army was able to defeat a larger
Spartan army.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As a result of this battle, the hostage went home because
the Thebans were now in a good position in their own area. When he went home,
he had new ideas running around in his mind. However, he was delayed by several
things. He decided to get married first and went next door to another kingdom
of northern Greece in the mountains called Epirus. Here, he married a
red-headed woman by the name of Olympias. He then started to put some of his
ideas into effect and this man became known to history as Philip II when he
became ruler of Macedonia.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Philip II also had a son by Olympias named Alexander.
Philip II decided that his son would follow in his footsteps and reap some of
the benefits of his genius. Therefore, he gave him the best tutor of the age - Aristotle.
Aristotle instilled in Alexander the concept of categories, the importance of
learning by categories, the importance of observation, the importance of
solution by logic, solution by calling on various categories of learning and
knowledge. At the same time, Alexander developed a very strong body and the
combination was to make him the most unusual man of his age and one of the
greatest men of history.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When Alexander was 18 years old, his father Philip II went
down and whipped all of the Greeks, but this victory was very temporary because
someone decided that Philip II was going to be too tough a man to handle and so
the Greeks, while defeated in battle, won a victory by poisoning Philip II. Little
did they realize that by getting rid of Alexander’s father, they had to accept
the son Alexander, for the son immediately came to the throne. We still have
the record of his first speech.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Alexander pulled his mountain men together and he said,
“My father found you wearing animal skins in the rocks of Macedonia. My father
pulled you down out of your caves and out of your rocks.” And he pointed to
some of them, “Even some of you had some sheep and my father took the animal
skins off of you and gave you the tunic of a soldier.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“My father gave you order. My father gave you discipline.
My father gave you cities. My father made it possible for you who were craven
cowards in the caves of Macedonia to go out and defeat the barbarians around
you. You will notice that since my father gave you these things, the Thracians
no longer come in to bother you. The people of Epirus do not come in to raid.” Alexander
went on to list the various barbarians who in the past had scourged this area.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Now, he said, “I’m going to start where my father
finished. My father gave you something in your homeland; I’m going to make the
world your homeland.” And this is exactly what Alexander did. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>So Alexander went down and whipped all the Greeks in the
south. Instead of calling himself the conqueror, he called himself the champion
of Greece. This was a very wise choice of words because immediately everyone
was sold on him, not because he was tough and had a great army, but because he
promised great things for anyone who was Greek.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Alexander immediately started to weld together an army.
He said we’re going back and whip the Persians. The Persians had invaded Greece
a number of times in the past, two times specifically reaching the Greek
homeland, a number of times in Ionia across the Aegean Sea.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Consequently, Alexander pulled an army together and
started to work. Immediately, he found that he had some problems of
administration. The biggest problem seemed to be how to say right face, left
face, forward march and all the rest of it and say it once instead of four
times. Every drill sergeant in the Macedonian army had to say right face and
left face and forward march and so on in Ionic, in Doric which was the language
of the Spartans, he had to say it in the language of the Thebans - Aeolic, and
then he had to say it in the language of the Macedonians.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They were all Greeks, but they all spoke different
dialects. These Greek languages were very, very different. For example, the
Doric language was a series of grunts and gutturals (for some 500 years)
because all they had in their language was a few commands and made known a few
needs, and therefore they didn’t have much of a language. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In contrast, the Ionic language, the Attic Greek, was a
very beautiful literary language. The language in between was the language of
the Thebans. Therefore,  it became necessary to take these languages, to mix
them, and produce a common language so that all Greeks and all parts of Greece
could understand it. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Up to this time, it had never been necessary because
Greece is a peninsula with many hills and valleys with little communication.
Because Alexander fused together a great Greek army, it became necessary to
have good communication among the men. Therefore, Alexander in his genius began
to develop a common language for the Greeks. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We call this language Koine, which is the Greek word for
common. Alexander took some of the beauties out of the Attic Greek, removed
some of the literary, took the Doric Greek and removed the grunts and groans,
and he put it all together with the mountain dialect of the Macedonians. The
result was a Greek language designed to have only a single meaning for what was
written or spoken. Anyone who used this language could only mean one thing.
Apparently Alexander had a great contempt for double talk. He wanted people to
understand exactly what he said. He did not want a language which would be
subjected to two or three interpretations.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>So Alexander invented the Koine Greek language which
evolved over a period of 300 years and became the most scientific, exact
language in the history of communication. The Koine Greek, which Alexander invented
is the language of the New Testament.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When Alexander started working on this language, he was
in the peninsula of Greece and took the language with him because he took his
army with him. When he was 20 years old, he invaded the empire of Persia. He
fought three great battles and, in five years, he completely conquered Persia
and most of the Persian empire. He spent five more years conquering other
areas. Alexander went into India, into Bactria, and even to the edge of
Mongolia. Wherever he went, he was successful and he conquered. The main thing
that kept him from conquering the whole of India was that his troops were worn
out and refused to go any further.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>During this 11 years of conquest, he moved so rapidly
that out of the original 35,000 men who started, only about half survived with
him. The rest got tired and wanted to settle down. They’d say, “I’m too tired
to go any further; I’m going to stay here. This looks like a nice place to
stay.” And so these soldiers who were tired and exhausted were retired and in
this way Alexander started about 75 cities throughout the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Of course, a little of Alexander rubbed off on them, a
little of the administration ability and principles, so each would organize
their own city. These 75 Greek cities throughout the world became so well
organized and had such excellent administration that most of them thrived and
grew.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Alexander had a policy wherever he went. You had to speak
Alexander’s language. While he was a genius and had terrific linguistic
ability, he didn’t bother to learn other languages. It was one of the quirks of
a conqueror; you speak to me in my language, I will not learn yours. The result
was that those Alexander conquered had to learn his language. And as a result,
by the time that Alexander died, at the age of 32 from a severe unconfirmed
illness that lasted 12 days, everyone throughout the world spoke Koine Greek.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Where before people had been monolingual, now they were
bilingual or trilingual, but included in their linguistic ability was the
language compiled by Alexander. Not the beautiful literary language of Attica,
nor the language of the Dorians (the Spartans), but a beautiful, concise, clear
scientific language which became known as Koine Greek or Common Greek.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The original language of the New Testament is not some
super literary language. It was the language of the man on the street. It was a
language whereby anyone would understand what was being said. It was a language
which was developed with the concept of making it subject to one interpretation
and it became the language of the world. While the Romans conquered Greece when
they were conquering everything else, they did not conquer Greek culture. The
Romans conquered the Greeks, but Greek culture conquered the Romans. Greek
culture meant this new language and during 100-150 years under the Romans this
language underwent some additional changes in keeping with the orderly concepts
of the Romans. While Latin was the language of the Romans, Greek was the language
of the world during the Roman Empire.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the time of our Lord Jesus Christ in Palestine, nearly
everyone was trilingual. The Galileans were unilingual and only spoke Aramaic,
but the people of southern Palestine, the Judeans, were very well educated and
they spoke at least three languages, the Latin of the Roman conquerors, the
Aramaic (which was the Hebrew of their day), and they all spoke Greek.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is no accident that the original language of the New
Testament Scriptures would be Koine Greek. This is the language of exact
expression, so we have in the Canon of the New Testament, the highest concepts
of Bible doctrine that the world has ever known or ever will know. We have the
most lucid concepts of God and everything that God wants us to know, so much so
that 1 Corinthians 2:16 says, “We have the mind of Christ.” This is the
language of the New Testament. Every word in the language of the New Testament was
so developed that you can take a word, you can give it a suffix, you can give
it a prefix, a compound, a double compound word by adding a suffix, a
preposition, a basic noun and then adding some suffixes to that and you have a
word which will take a paragraph of English to explain.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every verb in the Koine Greek has a four-fold
navigational fix, so we know absolutely where we are at all times in this
language. For example, we know that every verb in this particular language has
a tense and these tenses explain the relationship of the verb to time. We have,
for example, in the English language a past, a present and a future tense. And
this is about as far as we go in relationship with time. But the Greeks went
way beyond this. They had some very fine variations. Time to them was broken into
a series of different concepts.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every time you have an Aorist tense in the Greek you have
two concepts. Visualize a line which on one side is eternity. The Greek
language is the best language in the world for expression of eternity. On the
other side of this is time. Here is the time line. The simple Aorist tense
would be a point of time in which something happened. But, you could also take
a series of parallel points of time and gather them into one group. You could
take this point of time and divorce it from time and perpetuate it forever, or
you could refer to a point of time in eternity past.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If you are familiar with a point of time in eternity
past, that is Ephesians 1:4, where He chose us in eternity past. In Acts 16:31,
you have a point of time divorced from time and perpetuated forever. You are
familiar with a simple point of time, “Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ.” But
that point of time is perpetuated forever, “thou shalt be saved,” i.e., “you
shall be saved one and for all.” In other words, the day in which you believe
in Jesus Christ, that point in time is taken out of time and it is perpetuated
forever. Occasionally, you hear the romantic statement, “I wish this moment
could go one forever.” While it can’t in reality in the English language, the
Greeks had a way of preserving that moment and they could preserve it by
putting it into the Aorist tense. That point of time could be taken out of time
and would be perpetuated forever and ever. That is what it means when it says,
“thou shalt be saved” in Acts 16:31. This is just one tense.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Koine Greek also has the concept of Aktionsart, which is
the opposite of punctiliar action. This is something that moves along
habitually. This is something that continues and there are many ways of
expressing that. Linear aktionsart is present time. In past time, something
that happened in the past but now has results that continue is a combination of
the two in the perfect tense. This is just one of four ways to determine the
meaning of a verb in the Greek.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Greeks also had a mood for every verb. There are four
possible moods. The first is the indicative mood. This is something that really
happened. “Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved.” That is Aorist
Indicative. You really are saved when you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ. The
subjunctive mood is the mood of potential. Maybe it will happen, maybe it
won’t. The imperative mood is the mood of command. A very interesting mood in
the Greek is the Aorist Optative, which expresses a wish. So again you have a
second fix on every verb form in the Greek.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The third navigational fix for every Koine Greek verb is
voice, which expresses the relationship of the subject to the verb. For the
active voice, the subject produces the action of the main verb. For example,
believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. That is active voice because you yourself do
the believing. For the passive voice, the subject received the action of the
main verb. For the middle voice, which is rather unique, the subject is either
benefitted by the action of the verb or the subject acts upon itself which we
call in the English - reflexive. So you have three ways to identify a verb.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fourth navigational fix is the etymology or the
meaning of a word. We now have an almost complete etymology on all of the
significant words of the New Testament. We have been able to trace their
etymology and how they were used. This is just the Koine Greek verb.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Greek noun provides many ways of determining it and
there is no doubt of the vocabulary of the Greek noun because they had active
or passive endings or causative endings. This is in the realm of the suffixes. For
the compounds that came from the prefixes, they could put a preposition with a
noun and give it additional meaning and significance. They had other things
they could put in front of the noun as well. Sometimes in the New Testament,
you will find a noun which is made up of three words and it becomes a very
significant and interesting word.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The little word “if” has four concepts in the Greek. If
and it’s true is the 1st class condition. If and it’s not true is the 2nd class
condition. If maybe it’s true, maybe it isn’t is the 3rd class condition. If, I
wish it were, but it isn’t is the 4th class condition. All of these conditional
clauses are found in the Greek.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The word “that” is used either as a result clause or a
purpose clause. Then you find Aorist Participles where the action of the Aorist
Participle precedes the action of the main verb. You also find infinitives that
express purpose. All this adds up to something. It adds up to the fact that in
the original language of the New Testament there can be for one passage, one
interpretation! There may be several applications, but only a single correct
interpretation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>People often confuse application and interpretation to
where they think a passage means two different things. One man may give the
interpretation, the other man gives the application and immediately people are
all shook up, they say, “Here are two great spiritual giants, one believes A,
one believes B, and these two are so different, how do we get A and B together?
We’re all confused; we’re all mixed up.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Well, one man A went to Dallas Theological Seminary and learned
to correctly interpret the passage from the original languages. The other man B
just drifted along by reading Christian magazines and listening to other people.
B didn’t go to Dallas Theological Seminary. He went to another seminary where
he got Apologetics and confusion and, therefore, he sometimes gives an
application and very rarely gives an interpretation because he doesn’t have the
tools to analyze the passage. What appears to some to be two spiritual giants
(and they may or may not be) giving opposite interpretations, one isn’t even
interpreting the Word of God at all! So really, there is no confusion, except
for those who are uninitiated.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We must now begin with our subject, how we got our Bible
with 2 Peter 1:12.  It is important that we begin here for a very definite
reason. The Bible you hold in your hand should be the most important document
in the world to you. It is the source of information with regard to eternal
salvation. While eternal salvation is as simple as believe on the Lord Jesus
Christ and thou shalt be saved, it can become very complex with its many
beautiful facets as we study and absorb these things.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Bible contains information with regard to the
believer’s spiritual life involving God’s wonderful grace assets. The Bible
also gives us a complete set of details regarding the future. The believer who
masters the Word of God (and only a believer can) is in a position to have
peace and happiness in their lifetime. The maturing believer should have no
qualms regarding the future, they should always be grace oriented, they should
always be productive (divine good), they should always be useful and successful,
regardless of what they do in life. You should understand from the Word of God
that every believer has a full-time ministry here on earth. Every believer is a
servant of the Lord and whether you serve him in business or in the household
or in the barracks or wherever it happens to be, every believer serves the
Lord.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Bible is the only source of divine viewpoint and
Peter was about to die when he wrote the passage we are considering, 2 Peter
1:12. He is about to check out of this world and he had learned a great many
valuable lessons in life. When a person comes to the end of their life, they
always wants to pass on what they consider are the most important thing of
life. For example, Joseph before he passed on gave what he considered the most
important information. He said, “Don’t bury me in Egypt,” because you are not
going to stay here. And even though the Jews stayed there another 400 years,
they were never discouraged. That is, the believers (the believing remnant)
were never discouraged, never gave up because they had the promises of God
uttered from the lips of Joseph just before he died. When someone is ready to
die, they usually get around to the important things in life. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore, I will always be ready to remind you of these
things, even though you already know them, and have been established in the
truth which is present with you.&quot;  (2 Peter 1:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Although Peter was just about to die, he wanted to leave
behind something that was very important - the heritage of the Word of God. There
is only one reason why women are free today - the Word of God. The Word has
made them free. This is rare in history. A lady in the past was on the par with
a horse, but not a good horse. Wherever there is the influence of regeneration,
of Christianity since the day of Pentecost, you find that women get a fair
shake in life. It is the only place they do. I don’t suppose there is one woman
in a thousand who appreciates the freedoms they have as a result of the Word of
God. Certainly the United States of America in this century and Great Britain
in the past century are perfect illustrations of the influence of Christianity
historically in a national entity. All of these things came to pass because of
one thing - the mind of Christ, the Word of God, the Canon of Scripture.</p>
