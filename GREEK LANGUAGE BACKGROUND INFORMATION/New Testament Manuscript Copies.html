monastery in Caucasus region near east end of the Black Sea. Published by
Beerman and Gregory in 1913. Important to later textual criticism.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Chester Beatty Papyri: </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One of the greatest discoveries of new biblical
manuscripts. One of the eight (8) oldest manuscripts. Date: Biblical
manuscripts are with one exception 2nd and 3rd centuries AD. Publicly made
known by Chester Beatty on November 19, 1931. It falls into three codices: The
Gospels and Acts containing 60 pages written in 200-250 AD.  Pauline Epistles
containing 172 pages and written in the 3rd Century. The Book of Revelation
Chapters 9:10-17:2 containing 20 pages and written in the 3rd century.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The “Greek Bible:” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Of the seven great uncial manuscripts described, four of
them--the Sinaitic, Vatican, Alexandrian and the Ephraem, contain or did
contain the entire Greek New Testament.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>King James Version: </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Of these oldest and important manuscripts, only two - Beza
and Claromontanus, were known and accessible at the time when the King James
Version of our English Bible was written in 1611 and they were not used to any
great extent. Textual basis for the King James Version will be discussed more
fully later.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Minuscule Manuscripts:</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>These are manuscripts written in small letters. Date: 8th
century and onward. The highest number of manuscripts counted was 2,352. Lake
says, “about 3,000.” Of these, 46 contain the entire New Testament, others have
sections.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Value: Even though the minuscules came later in time,
some of them were copies of older uncials. Therefore, a later minuscule might
carry an older text than a given uncial. There are several of real value: No.
1, 118, 111, 209, and 81. Minuscules are listed in the apparatus by number,
Uncials are by listed letter.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Papyri: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>These are single sheets or fragments of sheets, upon
which parts of the Bible were written in Greek. Discoveries: 1778 - Papyrus
found in Europe. 1820 - Papyrus found dating to 2nd century. 1877 - Papyrus
first discovered on large scale by Arsinoe. 1890 - systematic exploration
started under Professor Petrie. 1896-7 - Drs. Grenfell and Hunt of Oxford,
England found tons of papyri, ranging in age from 1st century to the 10th. 1925
- Robertson listed 34 fragments, 19 of which were found in Egypt. By 1940, the
number had increased to 52. Most are dated to 3rd through 6th or 7th century. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Value of the Papri: Age - 200 years or more older than
oldest known vellum manuscripts. They represent 12 New Testament books and
confirm their authenticity. Vocabulary; they throw much light on the meaning of
New Testament words. They reduce the supposed 550 “new words” of the New
Testament to 50.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Summary</u>:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are about 170 Uncials. There are about 2,352
Minuscules. There are about 52 Papyri. There are 1,565 Lectionaries. This makes
a total of 4,139 manuscripts, with more being discovered. We have 8,000
manuscripts of the Latin Vulgate and 1,000 manuscripts of ancient versions.</p>
