<h2>Textual Criticism</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What is textual criticism? It is the study on the
criticism of the text. This could be divided into two classes, the science of
textual criticism and the art of textual criticism. The science deals with what
was used... writing material, development through history, etc. The art of
textual criticism deals with the practice of determining which of the present
available manuscripts is the closest to the original manuscript or is the
original. Actually we have no originals today, just copies. Some things have been
altered, omitted, dropped, added. There are manuscripts that take us right back
to the originals, however, over 5,000 of them. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Each manuscript has to be analyzed as to principles. The
scribe copying the manuscript could make errors. Therefore, we must know what
type of errors the scribe would make.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Two Types of Errors: Intentional and Unintentional</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Unintentional errors could be caused by the following:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The scribe had to do these four things to write a
manuscript. Read a portion. Remember it. Dictate it to himself. Actually write
it. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Psychological factors: Tired mind. Poor health. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Errors from faulty eye sight primarily with the Uncial
text. The scribe had to deal with abbreviations. Some letters in the Uncials
look nearly the same. <span lang=EL>αμα</span> - together, <span lang=EL>αλλα</span>
- but.  Sometimes if two lines end in the same word, the words of either may be
left out. John 17:15. Sometimes things are copied twice. Acts 19:34. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Errors from faulty hearing: Rom. 5:1 is a possible
example... exomen, exwmen.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sometimes breathing marks were left out or not heard. <span
lang=EL>εἰς</span>, <span lang=EL>εις</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Errors of the mind between the glance and the writing:
Substitution of synonyms. Variations of the sequence of words. Transposition of
letters in a word. Mark 14:65. Wording may be confused with parallel accounts. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Errors of judgment:  Incorporating a margin comment into
the text. Sometimes no judgment is used at all.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Intentional errors:  Changes of spelling or grammar to
conform to the normal rules of spelling or grammar. Harmonization of parallel
passages. Adding or subtracting particular phrases, words, to make them make
more sense. Col. 1. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Changes to clear
up apparent historical or geographical problems. Conflation of readings.
Incorporation of two variant reading into one new reading. Changes based on
doctrinal positions, of course, slanting it to their direction. Luke 1:3 and
Matt. 24:36. Expansion of titles.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Greek Manuscripts: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Four major types of manuscripts and two other sources: </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Papyri:
manuscripts, earliest extant manuscripts today, dated 2nd to 4th Centuries.
Indicated in textual apparatus by “P” plus a number. Written in Uncials.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Uncials:
written in all capital letters usually on parchment, animal skins, 4th to 10th
centuries, usually more valuable than papyri. Papyri are usually more
carelessly copied manuscripts. They are usually designated in two ways,
sometimes three.  Capital letters: <span lang=EL>Α</span>, <span lang=EL>Β</span>,
C, D.  Greek letters: <span lang=EL>Δ</span>, <span lang=EL>Θ</span>, <span
lang=EL>Λ</span>, etc. Zero plus a numeral, up through 044 and these are
parallel to the above manuscripts, then at 046 they go through a long list of
250 manuscripts.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Minuscules:
written in small letters with most manuscripts having a sort of cursive or
connective writing. Also, they are written on parchment generally from the 8th
Century onward and designated by numerals: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Lectionaries:
There are approximately 2,000 available today, a few in Uncial, but most in
Minuscule. They are labeled for each day of the week and to be used in public
services. Most of the Scripture reading sections are for Saturday and Sunday
use. They date from the 6th Century on. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Versions: The
major contribution of the versions was to show actual verses or phrases had
been in the original text.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Patristic
quotations: These quote the Greek or Latin, but change the translation in their
own writings. If we had no other manuscripts, we could reconstruct the entire
New Testament from their quotations.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The four basic principles in analyzing internal evidence:
internal evidence deals with that of the text itself, how the text and its
contents support a given variant. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>The shorter
reading of textual variants is preferable. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>The reading
that is more difficult is preferable. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>The reading
that best describes one that another variant would arise from, is preferable. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>The reading
which conforms most to the author’s style is preferable. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Another factor
which must always be kept in mind is that of doctrinal harmony. That which best
conforms to doctrinal integrity must always be considered. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Principles and factors of external evidence: study of the
text types Note: External evidence involves weighing and comparing manuscripts.
Several factors are vital. These are the quality, not the age of the
manuscript, the agreement of the manuscripts, and the geographical locations
related to the manuscripts. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Alexandrian
text type: not to be confused with the Alexandrinus codex. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:0in'>Retains the
rough coarse style of the true Koine Greek.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:0in'>Retains the more
difficult readings. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:0in'>Retains the
shorter readings usually. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:0in'>It does not
usually undergo the systematic grammatical and stylistic polishing as do the
others. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:0in'>Where it does
wander is sometimes in technical grammar.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:0in'>It is believed
to be the best ancient text type and nearest the original. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:0in'>The primary
witnesses to this text type are the Sinaiticus <span lang=EL>Χ</span> and the
Vaticanus <span lang=EL>Β</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:0in'>When <span
lang=EL>Χ</span> and <span lang=EL>Β</span> occur together in the textual
apparatus, this is regarded as the correct original text reading. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Western text
type: D, Beza; I.T., Old Latin-Italic. This is considered to be the result of
undisciplined and wild growth of manuscript tradition and translational
activity. It can be traced to a very early date, some say as early as the
second century. However, not all agree. It retains the longer readings. It
substitutes synonyms for singular words. Usually the reading which the Western
text type supports doesn’t agree with internal evidence. Sometimes it will have
the shorter readings.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Caesarean text
type: Distinguished mainly as a mixture of A and W, Alexandrinus and
Washingtonus. It usually favors the A, but will put in the longer reading of
the Western. It is the least distinct and most mixed.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Byzantine text
type: Generally it is inferior and not likely to be the original. It smooths
out roughness by adding words. It alleviates difficulties. It makes additions
to strengthen certain doctrinal tenants. The most common characteristic is the
frequent harmonization of parallel passages. It is considered the weakest,
least original and is usually not referred to.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Principles necessary to follow in studying variants of
manuscripts: </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>You need to
know church history and the development of certain doctrines. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>One must know
Greek grammar, including sounds. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Be sure you
know parallel passages in the Gospels. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Each Gospel
writer must be given his own individual style. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Text of the
Septuagint must be considered when quotations are made. Also, the Hebrew text
must be consulted. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Reading should
be in harmony with the author’s style. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Sometimes a
variant seems to be in harmony with the author, but is opposed to external
evidence. The question you must face is: does the internal evidence oppose and
outweigh the external evidence? </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>It is better
for a novice to rely on the weight of external evidence than on the author’s
style, because a novice can objectify on less data in that field than on
interpretative factors of the author’s style. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Readings
supported by a combination of Alexandrinus and Western usually outweigh all
other combinations. However, in Paul’s Epistles, B, D, G, do not carry great
weight. Bis Alexandrinus in the Gospels and Western in the Epistles, Dis
Western. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>The combination
of W and C do not possess exceptional weight. W is the Washingtonus and C is
the Codex Ephraemi, a 5th century manuscript. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>True readings
survive mostly alone in the Alexandrinus.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Less reliable
readings with just the Western. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>Even less
reliable with the Caesarean. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>As a rule of
thumb, the beginner should follow the Alexandrian text type.  </p>
