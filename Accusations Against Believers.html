<h2>Accusations Against Believers</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer is prohibited from judging other believers.
Judging always has a bad connotation in Scripture. However, a believer is to
discern. Matt. 7:1-2, Rom. 14:4-10, 1 Cor. 2:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Do not judge so that you will not be judged. “For in the way
you judge, you will be judged; and by your standard of measure, it will be
measured to you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 7:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But he who is spiritual appraises all things, yet he himself
is appraised by no one.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 2:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses><img width=185 height=113 id="Picture 1"
src="Accusations%20Against%20Believers.fld/image001.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A believer in fellowship can evaluate and discern based
on their frame of reference that references the <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine
in the soul. However, a believer out of fellowship will always be judging.
Their own sin nature will control their thoughts and speech pattern. Every
believer must live their life as unto the Lord. However, parents have
jurisdiction over their children. Every believer has the right of privacy
before the Lord. God judges believers for judging others and for carnality.
Heb. 12:6</p>

<p class=Verses>“FOR THOSE WHOM THE LORD LOVES HE DISCIPLINES, AND HE SCOURGES
EVERY SON WHOM HE RECEIVES.”“ (Hebrews 12:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A believer is to leave all discipline in the hands of the
Lord. The corrected translation is: “Who shall bring any accusation against the
elect of God?” The answer is no one! Rom. 8:33.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Who will bring a charge against God’s elect? God is the one
who justifies;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 8:33, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan is actually the accuser of all believers. A
believer must be able to distinguish between the accusing ministry of Satan and
the convicting ministry of the Holy Spirit. Rev. 12:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, “Now the
salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His
Christ have come, for the accuser of our brethren has been thrown down, he who
accuses them before our God day and night.” (Revelation 12:10, NASB)</p>
