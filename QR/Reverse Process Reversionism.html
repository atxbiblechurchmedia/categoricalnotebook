<h2><a name="_Rewards"></a><a name="_D-Reverse_Process_Reversionism"></a><a
name="_Reverse_Process_Reversionism"></a>Reverse Process Reversionism</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As found in the Word of God, reverse process reversionism
refers to the distortion of both human affection and capacity for love while
such a believer is under reversionism. Reverse process reversionism only occurs
when you are already in reversionism. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Reverse process means to face in the opposite direction,
a change or a reversal of judgment, or a criticism. It means to appear in an
inverted position by a reversal of objects. In dynamics, it means a motion
under the influence of the same forces taking place in two opposite directions,
the different bodies running precisely over paths, with the same velocities,
only the directions being reversed.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some of you will find from this doctrine that you are in
reversionism and didn’t know it. Some of you are on the brink of reversionism
and will be saved from going into it. Others of you are not in reversionism or
tempted by it, but your problems lie in other areas.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Mechanics of Reverse Process Reversionism</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Under reversionism, the believer experiences a reverse
process regarding the objects of their true love or affection. This is why
Christian homes break up. This is why rapport friendships do not endure. This
is why some jerk divorces his wife and marries his secretary.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Under this process, the bona fide object of his love –
his wife, becomes the object of expressed hatred, bitterness, cruelty,
implacability, maligning, judging and revenge tactics, while inconsequential
people become the objects of attention, flirtation, social life, sex, and so
on.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In reversionism, the wife goes after anyone who seems
important, usually a male with ego, so she can deceive him. She tells him that
he is everything he always thought he was and her apparent love confirms it.
The male becomes a port in her storm. Reversionists find it easy to give their
attention, their love, their affection to inconsequential persons because they
are seeking self-gratification and auto-hedonism.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To the reversionist, the object of love affection or sex
is unimportant, therefore they reverse the object of their affection from a
true object of love to an inconsequential object. This explains why the Jews in
Jeremiah 9 turned from God to the phallic cult and drugs as well.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Examples of Reverse Process Reversionism</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Example #1: Citizen reversionism. Here, most citizens
love their country, whereas others love other countries that are in fact
enemies of their country. These reversionists are looking at the wrong
priorities. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Example #2: Corinthian believers. Paul was their right
pastor-teacher, but he was getting bitter criticism from them. 2 Cor. 10 and 2
Cor. 11.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Example #3: Jewish believers in the Book of Jeremiah. The
Jews were maligning and judging others. They were also involved in the phallic
cult. They were ignoring the true object of their love – the Lord Jesus Christ.
Jer. 9:14-15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but have walked after the stubbornness of their heart and
after the Baals, as their fathers taught them,” therefore thus says the LORD of
hosts, the God of Israel, “behold, I will feed them, this people, with wormwood
and give them poisoned water to drink.”  (Jeremiah 9:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Jews had stubbornness in their souls due to scar
tissue buildup. They went after the worship of Baal which they had learned from
their fathers. Therefore, in view of negative volition toward Bible doctrine
and positive volition toward Baal, there is spiritual and social
disintegration.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Jeremiah 9:15, “thus says the Lord of hosts” refers to
divine establishment with emphasis on the military maintaining freedom. “The
God of Israel” refers to Jesus Christ under grace and emphasizes the spiritual
principles of grace. “Behold, I will feed them” is the hiphil participle of <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>אכל</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(‘âkal) and refers to the people who are
in reversionism.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Wormwood” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>לענה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>(la‛ănâh) in the Hebrew and refers to a poisonous plant, which is
found in Palestine. It has a very bitter taste. The verb form means to be
cursed or to be rejected. This is a type of punishment that the believer brings
on themselves. Moses used the noun <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>לענה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>(la‛ănâh) in connection with idolatry in Deuteronomy 29:18. The Jews
then went from Jesus Christ to idolatry.</p>

<p class=Verses>“so that there will not be among you a man or woman, or family
or tribe, whose heart turns away today from the LORD our God, to go and serve
the gods of those nations; that there will not be among you a root bearing
poisonous fruit and wormwood.”  (Deuteronomy 29:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is also used for the bitterness of catastrophe in
Proverbs 5:4, Lamentations 3:15, Lamentations 3:19, Amos 5:7, Amos 6:12, and
Jeremiah 23:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But in the end she is bitter as wormwood, Sharp as a two-edged
sword.”  (Proverbs 5:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He has filled me with bitterness, He has made me drunk with
wormwood.”  (Lamentations 3:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Remember my affliction and my wandering, the wormwood and
bitterness.”  (Lamentations 3:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“ For those who turn justice into wormwood And cast
righteousness down to the earth.”“  (Amos 5:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do horses run on rocks? Or does one plow them with oxen? Yet
you have turned justice into poison And the fruit of righteousness into
wormwood,”  (Amos 6:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts concerning the
prophets, ‘Behold, I am going to feed them wormwood And make them drink
poisonous water, For from the prophets of Jerusalem Pollution has gone forth
into all the land.’““  (Jeremiah 23:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Jeremiah 9:15, “and give them” is the hiphil perfect
of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שׁקה</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(shâqâh) and means
to drink excessively or use drugs. “Poisoned water to drink” is literally tears
of opium or hashish. A corrected translation is, “Therefore thus saith the Lord
of the armies, the God of Israel, behold I cause them to eat wormwood or soul
disaster from reverse process reversionism. I will cause them to drink the
tears of opium.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When you have a maximum number of people practicing reverse
process reversionism, it destroys the nation. Believers with an edification
complex of the soul preserve a nation. When a maximum number of believers are
in reverse process reversion, spending time with the inconsequential person,
then the salt loses its savor and the nation crumbles.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Result of Reverse Process Reversionism</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Jeremiah 9:16, “I will scatter” is the hiphil perfect
of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>פּוּץ</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(puts) and refers to
the administration of the fifth cycle of discipline. “Among the nations” refers
to the Chaldeans in 586 BC. They have not known the Chaldeans as a friend, only
as an enemy. The Romans are in view here as well in 70 AD.</p>

<p class=Verses>““I will scatter them among the nations, whom neither they nor
their fathers have known; and I will send the sword after them until I have
annihilated them.”“  (Jeremiah 9:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“I will send a sword after them” refers to military
defeat. Military defeat always precedes the fifth cycle of discipline. One of
the most common sense things in the world is to build up militarily to fend off
disaster. “Until I have annihilated them” is the piel infinitive of <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>כּלה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(kâlâh) and means to consume completely
or utter destruction of a nation. Psalms 119. See category on <a
