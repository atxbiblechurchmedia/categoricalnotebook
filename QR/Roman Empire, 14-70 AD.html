<h2><a name="_D-Roman_Empire,_14-70"></a><a name="_Roman_Empire,_14-70"></a>Roman
Empire, 14-70 AD</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Economy</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Agriculture</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Marked by rapid growth of vast imperial domains and large
estates of wealthy Romans in the provinces. Pliny said that six Romans owned
half of the territory of Africa in Nero’s day. Large estates in Egypt were
granted to the family or favorites of the Emperor, especially under Claudius
and Nero. There was a trend of absorbing the medium sized and peasant plots.
The evil of absentee ownership was evidenced in the writers of the day, Seneca,
Pliny, and Petronius.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In spite of these problems, Italian agriculture was
fairly prosperous. A very significant practice started was for landlords to lease
their land to free tenants or colonies instead of using slave labor. One result
of this was the increase of grain farming. One reason for the increase of
tenant farming was either the decrease in the supply of slaves and/or the
uneconomic character of slave labor, especially under absentee ownership. Grain
raising was profitable in Italy, vineyards in Spain and Gaul. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Writers such as Pliny exposed the abuses of slave labor,
however, Pliny viewed slaves as domesticated animals. There were advances in
agricultural methods that includes wheeled plows with convex molding boards, crop
rotation was adopted, leguminous plants were used to restore the soil, selective
breeding was emphasized, and new forage plants were introduced from the Orient.
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some of the results of the large estates were in Sicily,
the moderate sized wheat farms owned by natives became large ranches owned by
the Roman proprietors. In Africa, extensive irrigation systems based on the
conservation of water made North Africa one of the most prosperous sections of
the Empire. It was next to Egypt in production of grain, olive, wine and fruit
products.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Major products of Egypt were wheat, flax, oil producing
plants, wine, dates, and wool. Cotton was not a significant crop. Spain and
Gaul soon rivaled Italy in the production of wine and oil. Spain and southern
Gaul were made of medium sized farms run by free native tenants supervised by a
Roman proprietor.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Industry and Trade </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>There were major factors that enhanced
the industry and trade of the Empire from 14 - 70 AD. There was improved security
of travel by sea and land, free intercourse between nations, minimum customs
duties, freedom of trade, and roads were built that led to all provinces. New
markets developed from frontier camps. River systems became important for
commercial purposes. River ports and regular sailings were established.
Urbanization of the Empire was advancing with the Emperors realizing that their
strength depended much on the cities. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>Old industries gained new markets
and new products kept arising. In second class or second rate cities, shops
lined the street with the operator living in the back and the small craftsmen
were the salesman for their products as well as the originator. Most of the
economy in the city was the small shop industry, yet there was evidence of
factory-made goods.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Observations regarding the industry and trade of the
Roman Empire in the first century noted that there was industrial and
commercial prosperity in the provinces. There was extreme individual fortunes
from exploiting or looting from war. Wealth was spread throughout the entire
Empire. In the East, old industries began producing luxuries of all sorts for
Rome and the Far East. In Alexandria and Phoenicia, glass manufacturers and the
textile industry immerged. In the West, Spain, Gaul, and Africa (urban class of
traders, manufacturers, and landowners) formed a solid basis of the Emperor’s
power. A capitalistic industry and agriculture arose in Gaul. In the western
provinces, mining for silver, lead, and tin in Spain and iron in Gaul, Noricum
and Illyricum were exploited. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Foreign trade of the Roman Empire reached its height in
the first century. Foreign trade of the Roman Empire and the Far East was of
historic consequence in the first century. This was one of the sources of the
depletion of the gold of the Roman Empire. The first century was marked by a
rapid growth of interprovincial trade. Productive loans at the lower interest
of four to six percent were made to finance business ventures. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Slavery still dominated in the trade and industry of Rome
and other cities. But, much more numerous now were the free wage laborers and
freedmen and lower middle class shop owners and workers. Often a man was given
a start in business by his emancipator and often became grain merchants,
builders, moneylenders, shop owners, entered professions and even became slave
dealers.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Travel in the Early Empire </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Throughout all the Empire travel became easy, rapid, and
secure. There was an excellent road system. The ordinary land travelers could
cover 50-60 miles a day. Lodging was usually third rate, not clean and not good
as to company. The toll keepers were generally dishonest. Rich men usually
traveled with great pomp. Poor men walked or rode donkeys. Nero had a suite of
1,000 carriages and his horses were shod with silver and had gold decorated
harnesses. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Travel by sea was usually from March to November. Sailing
was irregular with ships overcrowded and it was recorded that they carried 600
to 1,200 passengers. The one Paul was on was said to have 275 aboard. With
favorable winds they could make 100-150 miles in 24 hours. The army called up
20,000 men per year so this formed part of those traveling. This didn’t include
the shifting of the legions from place to place. All towns had their
foreigners. Greeks and Jews were everywhere.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Society</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Urban Conditions in Roman Empire (especially Rome)</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There was rapid growth in size and number of cities. This
was a natural result of general prosperity and expansion of trade. Centers of
trade includes London as the chief center for trade with Gaul. Corinth was the
intermediary for trade between Rome and Levant. Ephesus was a center for the
transit trade for the whole eastern Mediterranean region. Antioch was the trade
center for the transcontinental commerce of Asia with Syria and the West.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Rome had over a million in population and covers a radius
of 12 miles. Conditions in the cities, especially Rome, was hazardous because
of the narrow streets, tall buildings, and the impossibility of protection from
fires. Even the widest street had the width only of 16-19 feet. The streets
were unlighted at night and in spite of the 7,000 urban police in Rome, it was
still dangerous. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The wagons bringing things in and out of the city of Rome
were allowed to travel only on the streets at night so this kept a continuous
noise factor present. The poor, which made up a majority of the population,
lived in part or wholly at the expense of the State and could spend their days
lounging in the open spaces and enjoying the frequent shows. The slaves also
were sure of a living. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It was the honest free worker in Rome whose position was
especially precarious. After the great fire of Nero, Rome became a spectacle of
splendid public places, buildings, temples, monuments, colonnades, baths,
underground piping, and there was an abundance of pure water brought to the
city for houses and public baths.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>High Society </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The emperors rather than the aristocracy set the
fashions. The new rich and freedmen sought to make up for their lack of
breeding by the coarse show. The fact of wealth took complete dominance over
other factors such as how the wealth was obtained. No one asked how it came to
be or how it was gained. If the man had it, he had it. A freedman of Nero was
reported to have called a man worth only about $3 million, pitiably poor. There
was a mad scramble for wealth during the early Caesars. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The largest single private fortune in cash was 400
million sesterces. A sesterces was about one fourth of a denarius. A denarius
was 1/84 pound of silver. Therefore 400 million sesterces would equal 100
million denarius. 100 million denarius would equal about 1.2 million pounds of
silver. With the ratio of 1 to 15 with gold typical value ratio at that time,
this would equal 79,000 pounds of gold. 79,000 pounds of gold would equal about
1.3 million ounces, which at today’s prices of about $1,900 per ounce, would be
about $2.5 billion. This was his cash worth.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Luxury and Wasteful Spending</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Lavish spending equaled the drive for wealth. The
particular period was from Caligula to Nero, 37-68 AD.  Apicius squandered
nearly 90 million sesterces on delicacies and killed himself when he only had
10 million left. Agrippina had a dress of woven gold.  Lollia Paulina, a wife
of Caligula, wore 40 million sesterces worth of gems to a banquet one night. It
was said that 200,000 sesterces spent by Lucillus for a dinner was a modest
amount. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For the multi-millionaires, one city mansion was not
enough. Seneca reported that one new rich man paid 100,000 sesterces apiece for
cultivated slaves who learned Greek poetry to prompt him at his banquets when
he forgot a line. No expense was saved on Roman furniture or decoration.  A
great item of expense was the costly art products. The parading of silver plate
and gold was overdone. Seneca’s father-in-law, according to Pliny, a general on
the Roman frontier, carried about with him 12,000 pounds of silver. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Dinner plates were made of silver, each marked with their
proper weight. A slave of Claudius had a silver dish weighing 500 pounds and
others about half that weight. One discovery produced 97 silver articles for
table use. Funerals cost from a moderate 2,000 sesterces to 100,000 sesterces.
Anything as high as 1.1 million was considered exorbitant. The burial plots of
the new rich were 100 feet by 200 feet and planted with lots of vines and all
kinds of trees. Luxury produced many bizarre, coarse and vulgar shows.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Women and Morals </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Most information about women of the ancient world relates
to a limited wealthy class in the high society of the capital cities. Not much
is known about the great mass of women in the middle and lower classes. In
literature usually the dark and sordid endures over the virtues. The image of
the woman is also seen from the standpoint of Stoic teachings and prejudice.
However, the facts of the seamy side of life in high society reported by them was
correct. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The usual age of marriage for girls was from 12-16 years
of age. The girls entered marriage as a new life of freedom both legally and
economically. It was just like walking out into a dream world of reality. The
wife controlled her own property through her freedman or lawyer. If the wife
was rich, she lorded it over her husband. She was practically unrestrained
socially. She had free access to go where her husband went even into the
Emperor’s presence. This was the real “women’s lib” movement. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Seneca complained that the women attend functions in
their finery while they may be accompanied by their nobody husband. The women
lived in an atmosphere of intrigue, vanity, passion, and moral license. Divorce
was prevalent. Seneca said that the women counted their age not by their years
but by their husbands. Juvenal said that some had eight husbands in five years.
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There were several reasons for moral laxity. The many
slaves in the households of the rich gave them much idle time to pamper their
most pernicious desires. The Roman woman found no constructive field of
activity but just reveled in self-indulgence. She lived in the atmosphere of
scandal and seduction. She was sure of a willing lover among her slaves. Other
influences on moral laxity in general were the gross cruelties, tortures, and
slaughters over which the most delicate “ladies” gloated. Noble ladies became
admirers of athletes, chariot drivers, gladiators and stage singers. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some women challenged men in the gladiatorial games and
pursued other things usually done by men. The women were very influential in
politics and often shaped the politics of the emperor. The upper class ladies
were highly cultivated in Greek and Latin literature. An outlet for the female
energies of the Roman woman found expression in religions, pomp, ceremonies,
and emotionalism.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The worship of Isis gave the women much of their desired
expression. The immoralities at these temples were so great that Tiberius had
many of them completely obliterated. Roman women were strongly addicted to
astrology and magic of all types. Demonism among the women found expression in
evil trade in love philters (potions), poisons, and procuring.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Daily Life and Social Custom </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A typical day for a Roman senator was; up at dawn,
dressed with the aid of slaves, shaved by slave barbers and hair trimmed.
Beards were introduced by Hadrian in the second century. They wore one or
several large signet rings. Letters were dictated to slave secretaries who
wrote in shorthand. He had a light breakfast including wine or milk, bread and
honey, olives, an egg or bit of cheese. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The master had absolute power of life or death over the
slave. On the whole, the slave had a relatively free and easy life. After
breakfast the Roman aristocrat would receive his morning clients. These were
the poor who would come by for their daily “soup.” He would give them something
then assign them a task for the day to compensate for what he gave them. This
was given them at the close of the day, usually.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The man would then outline the course of the day’s
activity and his slaves would carry him along in the streets or accompany him
on his errands. This includes taking him to his superiors to whom he gave the
same expression. Each person had those catering to him, but he would cater to
someone above him, bootlicking from the beggar to the emperor. The man would
sometimes honor one of his underlings with an invitation to come to supper.
There were usually nine guests, three to a couch.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Festivals, Spectacles, and Games</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There were 37 festival days in the time of Tiberius per
year and this increased to 175 in the fourth century. Titus held one festival
alone that lasted 100 days. Trajan held one festival in 107 AD which lasted
four months. All major festivals began at sunrise and continued to sunset and
only stopped for lunch. Festivals began as religious observances then moved to
a means of buying the public support for the Roman Emperor. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Circuses were considered just as bread was, an
unavoidable necessity. In 51 AD, 1.7 million sesterces were spent in Rome for
public games. This equaled about 506,000 pounds of silver. In the early empire,
a normal 3-day gladiatorial exhibition cost about 400,000 sesterces. Great
centers of public amusement were circuses, amphitheaters, arenas, theatres, and
stadiums.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The largest circus had a seating capacity of 180,000.
Augustus limited the Empire to two gladiatorial shows a year with 120
combatants. Later, however, he gloated of eight in his reign where 10,000
gladiators fought. Five hundred African lions were slain in one of Augustus’
shows. Titus had 5,000 slaughtered in the dedication of the Colosseum. Trajan
had a great festival and 9,000 animals were killed. Condemned criminals and
Christians often were tied to stakes and left to the animals in the arena.
Children didn’t play cowboys and Indians, they played gladiators. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Regarding the theatre, Rome had three in operation,
usually only one at a time. The emphasis of the theatre was two low types of
drama, Atellan farces and mimes. Atellan farces were light drama and usually
had four main figures. Dotard: foolish old person whose mind is impaired by
age. Wise man: just that. Glutton: common meaning for this. Booby: a dunce or
stupid fellow. Mimes were the acting out of scenes from life. This usually was
a character sketch from the seamy side of life, full of obscenities and vulgarities
and appeals to the sensual.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Literature</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There was a dominant emphasis on rhetoric and declamation
in higher education. There was a predominance of poetry in the curriculums of
schools of rhetoric. Education lost touch with life. Verbiage, subtlety and
stirring speech was emphasized. Thought stagnated. Two basic forms of training
were given, using thesis in declamation and argument based on imaginary cases.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The prevalent method of teaching infused both poetry and
prose with declamatory style. (They would “knock” someone else literarily.)
There was a practice of public reciting of new prose or verse. This was the way
that a book or treatise was launched on the market.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Much of the writing, especially from 14-54 AD was in no
sense pure literature but was work of an encyclopedic character. During the
first century, Stoicism became an intellectual and moral force in the Roman
society and Seneca was its outstanding representative.</p>
