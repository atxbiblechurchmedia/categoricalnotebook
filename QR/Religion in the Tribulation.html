<h2><a name="_Religion_in_the"></a>Religion in the Tribulation</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Tribulation will be a time of maximum Ecclesiastical
and Ecumenical religion that opposes the plan of God and God's grace. Rev. 1:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“BEHOLD, HE IS COMING WITH THE CLOUDS, and every eye will see
Him, even those who pierced Him; and all the tribes of the earth will mourn
over Him. So it is to be. Amen.” (Revelation 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Tribulation will be the most religious period of all
human history. The Holy Spirit’s restraint on earth will be removed. There will
be no universal indwelling of the Holy Spirit in Tribulational believers. 2
Thess. 2:7. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only he who
now restrains will do so until he is taken out of the way.” (2 Thessalonians
2:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Religion’s greatest problem will be to explain the
Rapture, so this is attacked. Religion will claim unbelievers, the Gospel will
claim believers. Rev. 13:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And he opened his mouth in blasphemies against God, to
blaspheme His name and His tabernacle, that is, those who dwell in heaven.”
(Revelation 13:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ecumenical religion in the Tribulation will be
international in scope. It will be glamorous, wealthy, powerful, and will have
lots of pleasure with a program of entertainment. It will gain converts by
appealing to emotion, to lust patterns of the old sin nature such as
approbation lust, power lust, and religious lust. This is called immorality in Revelation
18:3. Rev. 17:12. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the
passion of her immorality, and the kings of the earth have committed acts of
immorality with her, and the merchants of the earth have become rich by the
wealth of her sensuality.&quot;” (Revelation 18:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;The ten horns which you saw are ten kings who have not
yet received a kingdom, but they receive authority as kings with the beast for
one hour.” (Revelation 17:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ecclesiastical religion in the Tribulation is called
Babylon. In the Old Testament, Babylon referred to the original city that was
destroyed. An account is given in Isaiah. In the New Testament, Babylon refers
to Rome (the Revived Roman Empire), the last headquarters for the
Ecclesiastical Religion system of the Tribulation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Dictator of the Revived Roman Empire will be the
political head of the ten-nation confederation. He will also be the head of the
Ecclesiastical religious system. Religion gains political ascendancy and in the
Revived Roman Empire religion will control the state and will be the state.
There will be great loss of freedom.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ecclesiastical religion will have very high adherence in
all nations, sometimes 90%, sometimes 100%, but at least lip service will be
given. Religion will dominate national entities, but national entities will
exist politically. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The religious system in the Tribulation will form
following a maximum saturation of the Gospel. When people exercise negative
volition at the point of God-consciousness and Gospel hearing, they create a
vacuum in their souls for an alternative, any alternative. In the Tribulation,
they will have more chances to say “no” to salvation in Jesus Christ than at
any other time in human history. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>People will be attracted to religion in the Tribulation
as many are in all dispensations. Religion will infiltrate the newly
constructed Jewish temple in Jerusalem, making it impossible to teach the
truth, therefore the necessity to evangelize outside the temple (the 144,000
and the Two Witnesses). There will be the Beast who will also be the Dictator
of the Revived Roman Empire who will have an outstanding personality and
leadership skills. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ecclesiastical religion of the Revived Roman Empire will
demand acceptance (at least on the surface) in the land (Palestine). This will
be done by setting up a statue of the image of the Beast in the Jewish temple
in Jerusalem and will also be called the Abomination of Desolation. There will
be a mandatory system of ritual and worship under pain of death. The Mark of
the Beast will be required to conduct any type of societal activity and will
bring enormous danger to anyone who does not have the mark. Rev. 13:17, Rev.
14:11. See category on <a href="#_D-The_Mark_of">The Mark of the Beast</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and he provides that no one will be able to buy or to sell,
except the one who has the mark, either the name of the beast or the number of
his name.” (Revelation 13:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever;
they have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image, and
whoever receives the mark of his name.&quot;” (Revelation 14:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Those negative to the Gospel will worship the Beast as
part of the religious system of the Tribulation. Rom. 1:21, Rev. 13:4-8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God
or give thanks, but they became futile in their speculations, and their foolish
heart was darkened.” (Romans 1:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“they worshiped the dragon because he gave his authority to the
beast; and they worshiped the beast, saying, &quot;Who is like the beast, and
who is able to wage war with him?&quot; There was given to him a mouth speaking
arrogant words and blasphemies, and authority to act for forty-two months was
given to him. And he opened his mouth in blasphemies against God, to blaspheme
His name and His tabernacle, that is, those who dwell in heaven. It was also
given to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them, and authority
over every tribe and people and tongue and nation was given to him. All who
dwell on the earth will worship him, everyone whose name has not been written
from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb who has been
slain.” (Revelation 13:4-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God will use two approaches to make their need clear for
the Savior, Jesus Christ. There will be evangelism by love (grace) and
evangelism by disaster (judgment). Many religious people will remain negative
to the Gospel of Jesus Christ no matter what system is used. They will be
evangelized by four waves of Gospel proclamation. Rev. 16:17-21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the seventh angel poured out his bowl upon the air, and a
loud voice came out of the temple from the throne, saying, &quot;It is
done.&quot; And there were flashes of lightning and sounds and peals of
thunder; and there was a great earthquake, such as there had not been since man
came to be upon the earth, so great an earthquake was it, and so mighty. The
great city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell.
Babylon the great was remembered before God, to give her the cup of the wine of
His fierce wrath. And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.
And huge hailstones, about one hundred pounds each, came down from heaven upon
men; and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail, because its
plague was extremely severe.” (Revelation 16:17-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Religion will be permitted to operate without restraint
in the Tribulation for two reasons. It is part of the Angelic Conflict and as
such Satan will be allowed a free hand by God in certain areas. It will be a
challenge to believers to learn Bible doctrine in the Tribulation. Lack of
Bible doctrine in their soul’s causes believers to get into false teaching and
religion.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Religion of the Tribulation does what all religion has
always done in every dispensation – promote the thinking of Satan. Satan is the
author of “being good” to achieve heaven. Any religion that seeks to solve
man’s problems by man’s efforts is satanic in nature. In the Tribulation,
religion will be able to use political power in order to persecute and destroy
those who are born-again.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All judgments on religion in the Tribulation are designed
to awaken the unbeliever to their need for the Lord Jesus Christ and,
therefore, will be fair. Most of the judgments will be against religion and
those who adhere to it – specifically the Fifth and Sixth Trumpets, the Second
and Third Angels, and all of the Vial Judgments. Believers who do not separate
from religion will get involved in the judgments of religion. Rev. 18:4-5. </p>

<p class=Verses>“I heard another voice from heaven, saying, &quot;Come out of
her, my people, so that you will not participate in her sins and receive of her
plagues; for her sins have piled up as high as heaven, and God has remembered
her iniquities.” (Revelation 18:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ecclesiastical religion will fall at the peak of her
power at Armageddon. Judgment from God takes place in one day. The destruction
will be so great that all unbelieving humans will be wiped out - only demons
will be left. This is the judgment of religion at the end of the Tribulation.
Rev. 18:8, Rev. 18:2, Rev. 19:2-3. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For this reason in one day her plagues will come,
pestilence and mourning and famine, and she will be burned up with fire; for
the Lord God who judges her is strong.” (Revelation 18:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And he cried out with a mighty voice, saying, &quot;Fallen,
fallen is Babylon the great! She has become a dwelling place of demons and a
prison of every unclean spirit, and a prison of every unclean and hateful
bird.” (Revelation 18:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“BECAUSE HIS JUDGMENTS ARE TRUE AND RIGHTEOUS; for He has
judged the great harlot who was corrupting the earth with her immorality, and
HE HAS AVENGED THE BLOOD OF HIS BOND-SERVANTS ON HER.&quot; And a second time
they said, &quot;Hallelujah! HER SMOKE RISES UP FOREVER AND EVER.&quot;”
(Revelation 19:2-3, NASB)</p>
