<h2><a name="_D-Redemption"></a><a name="_Redemption"></a>Redemption</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Redeemed means to be purchased from slavery. The
principle of redemption is the concept of bondage to the slavery of sin and
freedom from its domination. In John 8:31-36, “slave” is a bond slave.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;They answered Him, &quot;We are Abraham's descendants and
have never yet been enslaved to anyone; how is it that You say, 'You will
become free'?&quot; Jesus answered them, &quot;Truly, truly, I say to you,
everyone who commits sin is the slave of sin. &quot;The slave does not remain
in the house forever; the son does remain forever. &quot;So if the Son makes
you free, you will be free indeed. &quot;  (John 8:33-36, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Redemption is the saving work of Jesus Christ on the
Cross whereby He purchased the spiritual freedom of every member of the human
race. Jesus Christ set us all free by His substitutionary spiritual death for
all sins of mankind - past, present and future. The Blood of Christ depicts, by
analogy, the saving work of Christ on the Cross as well as unlimited atonement
and reconciliation. 2 Cor. 5:21; 1 Peter 2:24; Eph. 1:7; Col. 1:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so
that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.&quot;  (2 Corinthians
5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, so
that we might die to sin and live to righteousness; for by His wounds you were
healed.&quot;  (1 Peter 2:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;In Him we have redemption through His blood, the
forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace&quot; 
(Ephesians 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of
sins.&quot;  (Colossians 1:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Everyone is born spiritually dead and enters this life in
the slave market of sin. God the Father imputed human life to our human soul at
the point of our physical birth and also imputed Adam's original sin to our
genetically-formed old sin nature. We each possess an old sin nature located in
the chromosomes of every one of the estimated 30 trillion cells in our body.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Redemption emphasizes the fact that we had to be
condemned before we could be saved. When Adam's original sin was imputed to our
old sin nature at birth, it demonstrated God’s grace and wisdom. When we were
born physically alive, we were also born spiritually dead and were condemned by
God. We must first be condemned before we can be saved. This means that all of
those who never reached the age of accountability in life were automatically
saved when they died since they were condemned at birth and were never given
the chance to believe in the saving work of Jesus Christ. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The age of accountability is that mental age where the
person can first discern right from wrong and understands the consequences of
his or her decisions. It would not be fair for God to allow a person to die
without the chance to believe in Jesus Christ unless He automatically redeems
those who die at birth, those who die before reaching accountability, and those
who never reach accountability because of a mental deficiency.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Redemption Was Taught in the Old Testament</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Redemption was taught by means of animal blood in the Old
Testament. Just as today in the Church Age, Old Testament believers were taught
that the soul would be redeemed, not the body. If the body were redeemed, we
would never die physically. Old Testament believers like Job applied the
doctrine of Redemption to their circumstances just as we do, but they looked to
the future substitutionary spiritual death of Jesus Christ on the Cross when
our Lord would redeem them. Psalms 34:22; Job 19:25.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The LORD redeems the soul of His servants, And none of
those who take refuge in Him will be condemned.&quot;  (Psalms 34:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;As for me, I know that my Redeemer lives, And at
the last He will take His stand on the earth.&quot;  (Job 19:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Slave Market of Sin</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The old sin nature of all members of the human race
except Jesus Christ, was passed down from Adam's original sin. Adam is the
source because he sinned willfully and the woman sinned because she was
deceived by Satan in the Garden. Therefore, the old sin nature is transmitted
through the 23 chromosomes of the male during fertilization of the female ovum.
Rom. 5:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the
world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all
sinned—&quot;  (Romans 5:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The imputation of Adam's sin at birth is the basis for
spiritual death. The wages of sin are not your personal sins, but Adam's
original sin imputed to you at birth. No member of the human race has or ever
will be condemned by God on the basis of their personal sins. It was Adam's
original sin imputed to our genetically-formed old sin natures at birth that is
“the wages of sin.” Rom. 5:12; Rom. 6:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God
is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.&quot;  (Romans 6:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The judgement for every single
personal sin of every member of the human race was withheld until our Lord
Jesus Christ reached the Cross in a state of perfect sinlessness or
impeccability. God the Father then imputed all of mankind’s sins to the
humanity of Jesus Christ, not His deity. This was because deity can have no
contact with sin, cannot sponsor sin, cannot tempt to sin, and cannot commit a
sin. The humanity of Jesus Christ willingly accepted all of mankind’s sins,
from the first sin in the Garden to the last sin to be committed in the
Millennium. God the Father judged all of those sins. Then and most importantly,
the humanity of Jesus Christ was sustained only by the Holy Spirit as we are
today, willingly and without sinning even mentally, accepted the tremendous
punishment due to each and every one of them. Because our sins were imputed to
Christ on the Cross and judged, we can believe in Him and receive redemption
and 39 other things at the moment of our salvation faith belief. See category on
<a href="#_Salvation,_40_Things">40 Things Received at Salvation</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ purchased our freedom from the slave market
of sin. Psalms 34:22; 1 Peter 1:18-19; Gal. 3:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The LORD redeems the soul of His servants, And none of
those who take refuge in Him will be condemned.&quot;  (Psalms 34:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable things
like silver or gold from your futile way of life inherited from your
forefathers, but with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and spotless,
the blood of Christ.&quot;  (1 Peter 1:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law, having
become a curse for us—for it is written, &quot;CURSED IS EVERYONE WHO HANGS ON
A TREE&quot;—&quot;  (Galatians 3:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Our Redeemer’s Qualifications</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is the only qualified redeemer for mankind
in all of history. For Christ to be qualified as our redeemer, He had to do
seven things.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He had to be a true member of the human race. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He had to be without sin of any kind (impeccable) prior
to the act of redemption. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He had to be the mediator between God and man and be
equal with both parties. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He had to freely choose to go to the Cross and become our
redeemer. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He had to willingly accept the penalty for each and every
one of mankind’s sins while on the Cross. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He had to remain without sin of any kind throughout the
act of redemption on the Cross. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He could not use His deity in any way while purchasing
our spiritual freedom on the Cross.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He could not save us as God because the redeemer of
mankind must be judged for the sins of mankind. God cannot be judged for
anything. A true and sinless member of the human race was required. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Jesus Christ Had to Become a True Member of the Human
Race</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For Jesus Christ to become a true member of the human
race and to be born sinless, and He had to be born without a human father. This
is because it is the male's 23 chromosomes that carry the old sin nature, not
the female's. This means that if a woman’s ovum could be fertilized apart from
a human male’s 23 chromosomes (i.e., a virgin pregnancy), then the child could
be born into the world without an old sin nature. Without a genetically-formed
old sin nature in every cell as all the rest of humanity has, then God the
Father would not have a destination or target to which He could impute Adam's
original sin at physical birth. This means such a child would not be born
spiritually dead and therefore pass the first qualification for being a
redeemer. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This was the case in the birth of the humanity of Christ,
originating from Mary's virgin pregnancy and virgin birth. Being born without
an old sin nature meant there was no imputation of Adam's original sin to our
Lord. This was how our Lord was born as the Last Adam. The first Adam was
created perfect and through the Fall, then carried the old sin nature that has
been passed down to all humanity. The Last Adam, Jesus Christ, was born perfect
humanity because of the virgin pregnancy and remained sinless throughout His
life on earth. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mary, who was born with an old sin nature, was still a
virgin when she became pregnant for the first time with our Lord. Mary gave
birth after Jesus was born to at least six children by Joseph - at least two
daughters and four sons. Matt.13:55; Mark 6:3. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not His mother
called Mary, and His brothers, James and Joseph and Simon and Judas? &quot;And
His sisters, are they not all with us? Where then did this man get all these
things?&quot;&quot;  (Matthew 13:55-56, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and
brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? Are not His sisters here with
us?&quot; And they took offense at Him.&quot;  (Mark 6:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Holy Spirit provided the required perfect 23
chromosomes uncontaminated by the old sin nature to fertilize the 23
chromosomes provided by Mary. Mary’s chromosomes did not carry the old sin
nature. Remember, the male is the only source of the old sin nature in the
human race and is passed on through fertilization. Therefore, the virgin
pregnancy resulted in the virgin birth, which excluded the old sin nature from
the humanity of Christ. Remember that prior to Mary’s virgin pregnancy, she was
not perfect or impeccable. Only her virgin-born son, Jesus Christ, was
absolutely perfect at birth. The virgin birth was the basis for redemption,
because it provided the world with a perfect human being, the only One
qualified to be judged for the sins of the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In order to become our redeemer, Jesus Christ had to
become a true member of the human race for at least four reasons. The first
reason was that He had to become our Savior. As the Son of God, He could not
have any involvement with sin. To provide redemption, every sin of the entire
human race had to be imputed to Christ on the Cross. God the Father then had to
judge each and every one of those sins. This is the basis for our incomparable
salvation. Without becoming true and sinless humanity, Jesus Christ could not
have been judged for the sins of mankind.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The second reason was that Jesus Christ also had to
become a true member of the human race so He could be our mediator between
sinful mankind and perfect God. 1 Tim. 2:5-6; Heb. 9:14-15.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For there is one God, and one mediator also between God
and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave Himself as a ransom for all, the
testimony given at the proper time.&quot;  (1 Timothy 2:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the
eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience
from dead works to serve the living God? For this reason He is the mediator of
a new covenant, so that, since a death has taken place for the redemption of
the transgressions that were committed under the first covenant, those who have
been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.&quot;  (Hebrews
9:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The third reason was that Jesus Christ also had to become
our High Priest. Jesus Christ is our great High Priest today and is seated at
the right hand of the Father in His humanity and makes intercession for us. He
became a royal priest unlike the Levitical priests in the Old Testament.
Because Jesus Christ is a royal priest, Church Age believers are royal family
and are unique in their position because we share His position. This grace
position occurred after the Holy Spirit baptized us by placing us in union with
Jesus Christ (Baptism of the Holy Spirit or Positional Sanctification) at the
point of salvation. Now, each and every Church Age believer is a royal priest.
A priest is simply any member of the human race who represents themselves or
humanity in general before God. 1 Peter 2:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But you are A CHOSEN RACE, A royal PRIESTHOOD, A HOLY
NATION, A PEOPLE FOR God's OWN POSSESSION, so that you may proclaim the
excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous
light;&quot;  (1 Peter 2:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fourth reason why Jesus Christ had to become a true
member of the human race is He had to become the Son of David. More than 3,000
years ago, God promised David that he would have a son who would reign forever.
This promise or covenant required no conditions to be met by mankind for God to
fulfill His promise. Therefore, at the First Advent of Jesus Christ via the
virgin birth, our Lord received His second royal title of “Son of David.” In
order to become the Son of David, Jesus Christ had to become true humanity. In
His Second Advent, our Lord will fulfill that promise to David. The humanity of
Christ, riding a white horse, will come back and reign on earth, not only for
the 1,000 years of the Millennium, but for all eternity in the new earth. 2
Sam. 7:8-16; Psalms 89:20-37.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Now therefore, thus you shall say to My servant
David, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, &quot;I took you from the pasture, from
following the sheep, to be ruler over My people Israel. &quot;I have been with
you wherever you have gone and have cut off all your enemies from before you;
and I will make you a great name, like the names of the great men who are on
the earth. &quot;I will also appoint a place for My people Israel and will
plant them, that they may live in their own place and not be disturbed again,
nor will the wicked afflict them any more as formerly, even from the day that I
commanded judges to be over My people Israel; and I will give you rest from all
your enemies. The LORD also declares to you that the LORD will make a house for
you. &quot;When your days are complete and you lie down with your fathers, I
will raise up your descendant after you, who will come forth from you, and I
will establish his kingdom. &quot;He shall build a house for My name, and I
will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. &quot;I will be a father to
him and he will be a son to Me; when he commits iniquity, I will correct him
with the rod of men and the strokes of the sons of men, but My lovingkindness
shall not depart from him, as I took it away from Saul, whom I removed from
before you. &quot;Your house and your kingdom shall endure before Me forever;
your throne shall be established forever.&quot;'&quot;&quot;  (2 Samuel 7:8-16,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;I have found David My servant; With My holy oil I
have anointed him, With whom My hand will be established; My arm also will
strengthen him. &quot;The enemy will not deceive him, Nor the son of wickedness
afflict him. &quot;But I shall crush his adversaries before him, And strike
those who hate him. &quot;My faithfulness and My lovingkindness will be with
him, And in My name his horn will be exalted. &quot;I shall also set his hand
on the sea And his right hand on the rivers. &quot;He will cry to Me, 'You are
my Father, My God, and the rock of my salvation.' &quot;I also shall make him
My firstborn, The highest of the kings of the earth. &quot;My lovingkindness I
will keep for him forever, And My covenant shall be confirmed to him. &quot;So
I will establish his descendants forever And his throne as the days of heaven.
&quot;If his sons forsake My law And do not walk in My judgments, If they
violate My statutes And do not keep My commandments, Then I will punish their
transgression with the rod And their iniquity with stripes. &quot;But I will
not break off My lovingkindness from him, Nor deal falsely in My faithfulness.
&quot;My covenant I will not violate, Nor will I alter the utterance of My
lips. &quot;Once I have sworn by My holiness; I will not lie to David.
&quot;His descendants shall endure forever And his throne as the sun before Me.
&quot;It shall be established forever like the moon, And the witness in the sky
is faithful.&quot; Selah.&quot;  (Psalms 89:20-37, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Our Lord’s Sinlessness (Impeccability)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord was born without a sin nature, but could still
be tempted to sin externally (by others). Our Lord’s humanity was sustained on
earth throughout His entire life by God the Holy Spirit - His humanity was
always filled with the Spirit. This was unique in all of human history. Jesus
Christ was the first to use the unique spiritual life given to Him at His birth
by God the Father to be used by all Church Age believers following salvation. It
was His impeccable human nature that redeemed us. Our Lord’s salvation work is
called the Blood of Jesus Christ. In 1 Peter 1:18-19, our Lord is called “a
lamb unblemished and spotless” because He remained without even a single mental
attitude sin throughout His entire life - even under the most tremendous temptation,
testing, punishment and pain which none of us will ever know. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable things
like silver or gold from your futile way of life inherited from your
forefathers, but with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and spotless,
the blood of Christ.&quot;  (1 Peter 1:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ did not sin even though His temptation
pressures were far beyond anything any other human being will ever face. Even
though He had no old sin nature inside to tempt Him, Satan himself tempted Him
personally many times, something Satan did only with Adam and Eve. After 40
days without food, He was tempted to turn stones into bread. If He had, it
would have been contrary to God the Father’s plan for His life and, therefore,
a sin. When Satan offered our Lord the entire world to rule, he meant it as he
was and still is the ruler of the world. If Jesus Christ had accepted the
temptation from Satan, we would not have our so great salvation. Matt. 4:1-4;
Matt. 4:8-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness
to be tempted by the devil. And after He had fasted forty days and forty
nights, He then became hungry. And the tempter came and said to Him, &quot;If
You are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread.&quot; But He
answered and said, &quot;It is written, 'MAN SHALL NOT LIVE ON BREAD ALONE, BUT
ON EVERY WORD THAT PROCEEDS OUT OF THE MOUTH OF GOD.'&quot; &quot;  (Matthew
4:1-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Again, the devil took Him to a very high mountain and
showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory; and he said to Him,
&quot;All these things I will give You, if You fall down and worship me.&quot;
Then Jesus said to him, &quot;Go, Satan! For it is written, 'YOU SHALL WORSHIP
THE LORD YOUR GOD, AND SERVE HIM ONLY.'&quot; &quot;  (Matthew 4:8-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The sinlessness of Adam before the Fall differs from the
sinlessness of Christ during His incarnation. The first Adam was temptable and
capable of being tempted and capable of yielding to temptation. Our Lord, as
the Last Adam, was impeccable and able not to give in to temptation resulting
in sin because He was always filled with the Spirit and not able to sin because
of His deity. Our Lord’s unique God-man character is called the Hypostatic
Union. Hypostatic is a word which comes from the Greek word <span lang=EL>υ</span>̔<span
lang=EL>πο</span>́<span lang=EL>στασις</span> (hupostasis) and means to stand
under as a support, to take a thing on oneself, substance, essence, coming into
existence, actual being. It is translated in Hebrews 1:3 as the English word
“nature,” in Hebrews 3:14 and Hebrews 11:1 as the English word “assurance.” </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He is the radiance of His glory and the exact
representation of His nature, and upholds all things by the word of His power.
When He had made purification of sins, He sat down at the right hand of the
Majesty on high,&quot;  (Hebrews 1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast
the beginning of our assurance firm until the end,&quot;  (Hebrews 3:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the
conviction of things not seen.&quot;  (Hebrews 11:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Because Christ was undiminished deity as God the Son, His
immutable holiness or integrity (perfect righteousness, justice, and love)
could not sin. Because Christ was also true and perfect humanity, His humanity was
constantly filled with the Holy Spirit and functioned in the spiritual life and
never chose to convert temptation into sin. Therefore, Christ was able not to
sin. This qualified our Lord to go to the Cross and be judged for the sins of
the human race, thus providing eternal life for all who believe in Him. John
3:16; 2 Cor. 5:21; 1 Peter 1:18-19.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;For God so loved the world, that He gave His only
begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal
life. &quot;  (John 3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so
that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.&quot;  (2 Corinthians
5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable things
like silver or gold from your futile way of life inherited from your
forefathers, but with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and spotless,
the blood of Christ.&quot;  (1 Peter 1:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Jesus Christ Had to Qualify as the Mediator Between
God and Man</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In order to be our Redeemer, Jesus Christ had to qualify
as the mediator between God and man and be equal with both parties. Jesus
Christ is both God and true humanity in one person - the Hypostatic Union.
Hypostatic Union refers to the two natures of Jesus Christ that are inseparably
united and without mixture or loss of their separate identities. Jesus Christ’s
deity and humanity have no loss or transfer of properties or attributes between
them with the result being a personal and eternal union. Since His incarnation,
our Lord Jesus Christ is both true humanity and undiminished deity in one
person forever. Jesus Christ is different from the Father and the Spirit in
that He is true humanity. He is different from true humanity in that He is God.
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As God the Son, He is co-equal and co-eternal with God
the Father and God the Holy Spirit. Because God is one is essence and three in
personality, all three members of the Trinity have identical attributes or
essence. Each member of the Trinity has co-equal, co-eternal, and co-infinite
sovereignty, holiness, justice, righteousness, love, eternal life, omniscience,
omnipresence, omnipotence, immutability and veracity. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As true humanity, Jesus Christ is equal and superior to
all members of the human race. Therefore, as the unique God-man, He becomes the
mediator between God and man. Jesus Christ prior to His incarnation was only
true and perfect deity. Following His First Advent at the point of the virgin
birth, Jesus Christ became the unique God-man in Hypostatic Union forever.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Jesus Christ Had to Freely Choose to Go to the Cross
and Become Our Redeemer</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ had to willingly go to the Cross even though
He was fully aware of what was to happen. This was the ultimate test of His
free will and the personal sense of destiny of our Lord. He understood that
untold physical, mental, and especially spiritual suffering that awaited Him
and yet He chose to go freely and fulfill God the Father’s plan. This was a test
of Jesus Christ’s unconditional love for every member of the human race. In
Matthew 26:39-44, our Lord prayed three times that He was willing to be our Redeemer,
if it was the Father’s will for His life. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He went a little beyond them, and fell on His face
and prayed, saying, &quot;My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from
Me; yet not as I will, but as You will.&quot; And He came to the disciples and
found them sleeping, and said to Peter, &quot;So, you men could not keep watch
with Me for one hour? &quot;Keep watching and praying that you may not enter
into temptation; the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.&quot; He went
away again a second time and prayed, saying, &quot;My Father, if this cannot
pass away unless I drink it, Your will be done.&quot; Again He came and found
them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. And He left them again, and went away
and prayed a third time, saying the same thing once more.&quot;  (Matthew
26:39-44, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Jesus Christ Had to Willingly Accept the Penalty for
Mankind’s Sins</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One of the most important aspects of our Lord’s
substitutionary spiritual death on the Cross was His awareness of each and
every one of mankind’s sins as He accepted them during the imputation of all of
them from God the Father. He accepted every sin based on His unconditional love
for each of us. Following this imputation of all mankind’s sins, Jesus Christ’s
humanity, who had never known sin, now had all of them imputed to his body (not
His soul). 2 Cor. 5:21. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so
that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.&quot;  (2 Corinthians
5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The next and most important phase of our Lord’s
substitutionary work on the Cross involved His unwavering willingness to accept
each sin’s penalty based on His personal love for God the Father. The humanity
of Jesus Christ developed this personal love that was unparalleled in human
history from the Bible doctrine that He learned and applied throughout His life
just as all believers do now in the Church Age. Our Lord’s acceptance of the
imputed judgement for each sin was the ultimate act of love that a believer can
possibly have. Our Lord was the first to test the limits of the spiritual life
for believers. Although He was tested far beyond our abilities, He found no
limits to the omnipotent sustaining power of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Jesus Christ Had to Remain Without Sin of Any Kind
Throughout the Act of Redemption</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The three hours of darkness that covered Golgotha were
the most intensive moments in all of history. The judgement for every single
sin of the human race was withheld until our Lord Jesus Christ reached the
Cross in a state of perfect sinlessness or impeccability. God the Father, in
His perfect justice, then imputed all of mankind’s sins to the humanity of
Jesus Christ. The humanity of Jesus Christ willingly accepted all of mankind’s
sins, from the first sin in the Garden to the last sin to be committed in the
Millennium. God the Father then judged all of those sins. Then and most
importantly, the humanity of Jesus Christ sustained only by the Holy Spirit as
we are today, willingly and without sinning even mentally, accepted the
tremendous punishment due to each and every one of them. Because our sins were
imputed to Christ on the Cross and judged, we can believe in Him and receive
redemption and 39 other things at the moment of our salvation faith belief.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In His unique spiritual death, Jesus Christ received, in
three hours, the judgment for billions of sins. This was why He screamed to God
the Father in Matthew 27:46, &quot;My God, My God, why have You forsaken
Me?&quot;</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;About the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice,
saying, &quot;ELI, ELI, LAMA SABACHTHANI?&quot; that is, &quot;MY GOD, MY GOD,
WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME?&quot; &quot;  (Matthew 27:46, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All the personal sins of the human race were imputed to
our Lord on the Cross. God the Father judged every one of those sins in Christ.
The judgement received in our place was so intense that He screamed out. Even
through all of this, Jesus Christ had to remain perfectly sinless. His humanity
could not have even one mental attitude sin at any point during the bearing of
our sins. He didn't sin and didn't even react to the judgement. Not only did He
remain impeccable, but He endured the suffering.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The power of the Holy Spirit sustained Jesus Christ
continually when He was on the Cross just as He did His entire life on Earth.
That same omnipotent power is now available to every Church Age believer while
filled with the Holy Spirit to sustain us during our short time here on earth.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Jesus Christ Could Not Use His Deity in Any Way While
Purchasing Our Spiritual Freedom</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord is both deity and true humanity in one unique
person. Both are united, but without any transfer of attributes from each. The
attributes always adhere to their corresponding natures. The essence of His
deity cannot be changed. The infinite cannot be transferred to the finite. To
take from God a single attribute of His deity would destroy His deity. To take
from the humanity of Jesus a single attribute of His humanity would destroy His
true humanity. So no attribute of divine essence was changed by the
incarnation. Heb. 13:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and
forever.&quot;  (Hebrews 13:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This means no attributes of deity can be changed.
Sovereignty, righteousness, justice, eternal life, love, omniscience,
omnipresence, omnipotence, veracity, and immutability cannot ever be changed.
Deity is always perfect in every way. In fulfilling the Father's plan while
here on earth, certain attributes of our Lord's deity were not used. However,
this does not imply that they were either surrendered or destroyed. The Son of
God voluntarily took upon Himself the form of mankind to redeem man from sin,
to reconcile man to God, and to satisfy or propitiate God the Father. In
completing our Lord’s mission, He did not exercise His divine attributes to
either benefit Himself or to provide for Himself or to glorify Himself.
Therefore, the union of the divine essence and the human nature in the
incarnate Christ must be considered Hypostatic and personal.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Hypostatic Union of Jesus Christ, not a single
attribute of divine essence was ever compromised or changed. In taking on
Himself the form of true humanity, Jesus Christ veiled His preincarnate glory.
However, Jesus Christ never surrendered or destroyed even one characteristic of
His divine essence. The perfect man, Jesus Christ in His humanity, became a
bond-servant. Eternal God became a bond-servant so that we could have eternal
life. Phil. 2:5-8. See category on <a href="#_Kenosis">Kenosis</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ
Jesus, who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality
with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a
bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men. Being found in appearance
as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even
death on a cross.&quot;  (Philippians 2:5-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>While the deity of Christ was united to His perfect and
impeccable humanity, His humanity was still subject to temptations, distresses,
weakness, pain, sorrow, and limitation, a state which continued until His
resurrection. From His own sovereignty, His own divine free will, our Lord did
not use His own attributes of deity (e.g., omnipotence, omniscience) to benefit
Himself. He voluntarily restricted the independent use of His own divine power
and other attributes in compliance with the Father's plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The deity of our Lord did not in any way surrender any of
His eternal and immutable attributes. While our Lord was paying for our sins on
the Cross, His deity continued to hold the universe together by the word of His
power as He always has since He created it. Heb. 1:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He is the radiance of His glory and the exact
representation of His nature, and upholds all things by the word of His power.
When He had made purification of sins, He sat down at the right hand of the
Majesty on high,&quot;  (Hebrews 1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It’s very important to remember that our Lord did not
depend upon His own omnipotence, but upon the omnipotence of God the Holy
Spirit during His entire existence on earth. Only in this way could He remain
true and sinless humanity and be our redeemer. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Results of Our Redemption</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our redemption through the Blood of Jesus Christ means we
have a perfect and eternal salvation through a simple and uncluttered act of
faith in that perfect work. We can do nothing to ever deserve it or earn it. We
are to simply accept it and then move on into the spiritual life to learn the
thinking of Jesus Christ and to learn how to use the enabling power of the Holy
Spirit provided for each of us. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We should also remember that redemption provided
additional grace benefits. We are delivered from the curse of the Mosaic Law. Gal.
3:13; Gal. 4:4-6. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law, having
become a curse for us—for it is written, &quot;CURSED IS EVERYONE WHO HANGS ON
A TREE&quot;—&quot;  (Galatians 3:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth
His Son, born of a woman, born under the Law, so that He might redeem those who
were under the Law, that we might receive the adoption as sons. Because you are
sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying,
&quot;Abba! Father!&quot;&quot;  (Galatians 4:4-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All of our sins are forgiven at the point of salvation and
throughout the spiritual life. Isaiah 44:22; Eph. 1:7; Col. 1:14; Heb. 9:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;I have wiped out your transgressions like a thick
cloud And your sins like a heavy mist. Return to Me, for I have redeemed
you.&quot;&quot;  (Isaiah 44:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;In Him we have redemption through His blood, the
forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace&quot; 
(Ephesians 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of
sins.&quot;  (Colossians 1:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For this reason He is the mediator of a new covenant, so
that, since a death has taken place for the redemption of the transgressions
that were committed under the first covenant, those who have been called may
receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.&quot;  (Hebrews 9:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Redemption is the basis for our justification and our
sanctification. Rom. 3:24; Eph. 5:25-27.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;being justified as a gift by His grace through the
redemption which is in Christ Jesus;&quot;  (Romans 3:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the
church and gave Himself up for her, so that He might sanctify her, having
cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, that He might present to
Himself the church in all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle or any such
thing; but that she would be holy and blameless.&quot;  (Ephesians 5:25-27,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Redemption results in adoption. Redemption is the basis
for our eternal inheritance in Christ. Gal. 4:4-6; Heb. 9:15. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth
His Son, born of a woman, born under the Law, so that He might redeem those who
were under the Law, that we might receive the adoption as sons. Because you are
sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying,
&quot;Abba! Father!&quot;&quot;  (Galatians 4:4-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For this reason He is the mediator of a new covenant, so
that, since a death has taken place for the redemption of the transgressions
that were committed under the first covenant, those who have been called may
receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.&quot;  (Hebrews 9:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Redemption is
the basis for Jesus Christ’s victory in the Angelic Conflict. Col. 2:14-15; Heb.
2:14-15.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;having canceled out the certificate of debt consisting of
decrees against us, which was hostile to us; and He has taken it out of the
way, having nailed it to the cross. When He had disarmed the rulers and
authorities, He made a public display of them, having triumphed over them
through Him.&quot;  (Colossians 2:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood,
He Himself likewise also partook of the same, that through death He might
render powerless him who had the power of death, that is, the devil, and might
free those who through fear of death were subject to slavery all their
lives.&quot;  (Hebrews 2:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Redemption of the soul at salvation will result in
redemption of the body at the Rapture of the Church. Eph. 1:14; Rom. 8:23; Eph.
4:30.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;who is given as a pledge of our inheritance, with a view
to the redemption of God's own possession, to the praise of His glory.&quot; 
(Ephesians 1:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And not only this, but also we ourselves, having the
first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting
eagerly for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our body.&quot;  (Romans
8:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were
sealed for the day of redemption.&quot;  (Ephesians 4:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Redemption provides us with the option of salvation
through faith alone in Christ alone based solely on His substitutionary
spiritual death on the Cross. Redemption emphasizes the character of the Son,
the Lord Jesus Christ. Propitiation emphasizes the character of the Father. At
the point of redemption, we can have peace of mind, stability, and a relaxed
mental attitude by knowing the doctrine of redemption. God has paid for and
provided for everything. 1 Peter 1:18-19.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable things
like silver or gold from your futile way of life inherited from your
forefathers, but with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and spotless,
the blood of Christ.&quot;  (1 Peter 1:18-19, NASB)</p>
