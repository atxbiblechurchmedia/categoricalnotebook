<h2>Reversionism Recovery</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Recovery from reversionism involves confession of sin to
God the Father via 1 John 1:9 and taking in and applying Bible doctrine. Heb.
6:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore leaving the elementary teaching about the Christ,
let us press on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from
dead works and of faith toward God, of instruction about washings and laying on
of hands, and the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment.” (Hebrews
6:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Recovery from reversionism is impossible under
circumstances of apostacy. In Hebrews 6:3-6, “they again crucifying to
themselves the Son of God” continued their reversionism. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And this we will do, if God permits. For in the case of those
who have once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and have
been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good word of God
and the powers of the age to come, and then have fallen away, it is impossible
to renew them again to repentance, since they again crucify to themselves the
Son of God and put Him to open shame.” (Hebrews 6:3-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Revelation 3:18, “I advise you” is the present active
indicative of <span lang=EL>συμβουλευ</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(sumbouleuō) and means to strongly advise. “To buy” is the aorist active
infinitive of <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>γορα</span>́<span lang=EL>ζω</span>
(agorazō) and is a constantive aorist and is used for the grace apparatus for
perception, being positive every day to doctrine. </p>

<p class=Verses>“I advise you to buy from Me gold refined by fire so that you
may become rich, and white garments so that you may clothe yourself, and that
the shame of your nakedness will not be revealed; and eye salve to anoint your
eyes so that you may see.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation 3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Gold” is <span lang=EL>χρυσι</span>́<span lang=EL>ον</span>
(chrusion) and does not refer to gold found in the ground, but highly refined
gold, gold in jewelry, and in coins. The highest value in this life is Bible
doctrine! “Refined by fire” is the perfect passive participle and means there
are no impurities or dross in Bible doctrine. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“That you may become rich” is the constantive aorist
active subjunctive of <span lang=EL>πλουτε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(plouteō) and means to be rich daily and increase riches daily. The
constantive aorist gathers up the daily function of the grace apparatus for
perception. The active voice means the believer has to decide every day for
doctrine, not just once in a while. The subjunctive mood means recovery from
reversionism is potential depending upon intake of Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“White garments” is <span lang=EL>λευκο</span>́<span
lang=EL>ς</span><span lang=EL> </span><span lang=EL>ι</span>̔<span lang=EL>μα</span>́<span
lang=EL>τιον</span> (leukos himation) in the Greek and represents a mantle of
white, the edification complex of the soul. “That you may clothe yourself” is
the aorist middle subjunctive of <span lang=EL>περιβα</span>́<span lang=EL>λλω</span>
(periballō) and means to put around or building of the edification complex “clothes”
the soul. “Shame” is <span lang=EL>αι</span>̓<span lang=EL>σχυ</span>́<span
lang=EL>νη</span> (aischunē) and refers to emotional revolt of the soul which
accompanies reversionism. “Eye salve” is <span lang=EL>κολλου</span>́<span
lang=EL>ριον</span> (kollourion) and was a very famous medicine developed in
Laodicea. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Anoint your eyes” means to start getting back to Bible
doctrine where you may have to relearn basic doctrines. “So that you may see”
is the present active subjunctive and means to keep on seeing. You must stay
with it. The issue is not whether you start, but if you will stay with it.
Regarding this eye salve used in the ancient world, if you used it just once or
so, it didn’t do any good. You had to keep on using it to produce the desired
effect.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Divine Discipline to Help Recover From Reversionism</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divine discipline is God's motivation for the believer to
recover from reversionism. In Revelation 3:19, “I reprove” is <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span
lang=EL>λε</span>́<span lang=EL>γχω</span> (elegchō) and means to keep on
judging, to try a case and penalize. This is done through a pastor-teacher
teaching the Word of God. “Be zealous” is the present active imperative of <span
lang=EL>ζηλευ</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (zēleuō) and means to keep on
boiling, to be hot! Compare it with “hot” in the previous passage. This is
getting turned on for doctrine. </p>

<p class=Verses>“‘Those whom I love, I reprove and discipline; therefore be
zealous and repent.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation 3:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“And repent” is the ingressive aorist active imperative
of <span lang=EL>μετανοε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (metanoeō) and means to
change your mind so you can keep on being hot for Bible doctrine. You have to
change your thinking concerning Bible doctrine and its importance in your life.
You have to change your thinking concerning the authority of the pastor-teacher.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Reversion Recovery Illustration</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>By now, all of us must realize that Revelation 3:18-22 is
addressed to believers in reversionism. Here, there are no hot believers and no
cold unbelievers. Not by any stretch of the imagination can you make this into
an appeal for salvation! </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Revelation 3:20, “Behold” is <span lang=EL>ι</span>̓<span
lang=EL>δου</span>́ (idou) and is an imperative from <i>horao</i>. It becomes a
very strong particle for getting attention. “I stand” is the perfect active
indicative of <span lang=EL>ι</span>̔́<span lang=EL>στημι</span> (histēmi) and
means Jesus Christ keeps on standing outside your soul while your soul is in
reversionism. Inside the house is like inside the soul. The status inside there
is now reversionism, therefore Christ is outside the soul patiently waiting for
your positive volition. </p>

<p class=Verses>“‘Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears My
voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and will dine with him, and he
with Me.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation 3:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Knock” is the present active indicative of <span
lang=EL>κρου</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (krouō) and means Jesus Christ
keeps on knocking. That’s grace. The door indicates the person is alive and
that the sin unto death has not yet been administered. “If anyone hears” is a
third class condition of “if.” If he opens with positive volition, Bible
doctrine will come into his soul and he will recover spiritually. If he
doesn’t, he will continue to receive more intensified divine discipline and if
that continues long enough, God may administer the sin unto death.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Hears” is the constantive aorist active subjunctive of <span
lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>κου</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (akouō) and
refers to the grace apparatus for perception. It means to listen and
concentrate with positive volition toward doctrine. Assemble and obey. When you
hear Him knock, you must make the decision. “My voice” is the aorist active
subjunctive of <span lang=EL>φωνη</span>́ (phōnē) and refers to Bible
doctrine. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Opens the door” is the aorist active subjunctive of <span
lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>νοι</span>́<span lang=EL>γω</span> (anoigo) and
means positive volition, confession of sin, and the reception of Bible doctrine
under the grace apparatus for perception. The subjunctive is the mood of
volition where you may go positive or you may stay negative. The door refers to
the soul. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“I will come” is the future active indicative of <span
lang=EL>ει</span>̓<span lang=EL>σε</span>́<span lang=EL>ρχομαι</span>
(eiserchomai) and refers to the mind of Christ or Bible doctrine, not
salvation. Jesus Christ already indwells these believers. “And will dine” is
the future active indicative of <span lang=EL>δειπνε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(deipneō) and means to sit around a table of good food and have fun, to
fellowship. God is not trying to deprive you of fun. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God provides on the most excellent food that can exist –
His Word, His thinking. It means excellent fellowship, relaxed atmosphere,
rapport, inner happiness, the edification complex constructed, capacity for
life, good food, good friends, good fellowship.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Reward for Recovery from Reversionism</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Revelation 3:21, “He who overcomes” is the present
active participle of <span lang=EL>νικα</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (nikaō)
and means the one conquering, that is, recovering from reversionism. “Will I
grant” is the future active indicative of <span lang=EL>δι</span>́<span
lang=EL>δωμι</span> (didōmi) and means will I give grace. “To sit down with Me
on my throne” means to reign with Him as a great reward. “As I also overcame”
is the aorist active indicative of <span lang=EL>νικα</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(nikaō) and refers to Jesus Christ’s strategic victory on the Cross in the
Angelic Conflict. This was His completion of the plan of the Father for His
incarnation. “And sat down” is the aorist active indicative of <span lang=EL>καθι</span>́<span
lang=EL>ζω</span> (kathizō) and means that all work was completed. First God
the Father rested, then the Son sat when the Angelic Conflict was resolved.</p>

<p class=Verses>“‘He who overcomes, I will grant to him to sit down with Me on
My throne, as I also overcame and sat down with My Father on His throne.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation
3:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Revelation 3:22, “He who has an ear” refers to anyone
who has ears can hear the teaching of Bible doctrine. They also need positive
volition to make the grace apparatus for perception operable via the enabling
power of the Holy Spirit. You as a believer have the apparatus to function on Bible
doctrine in the spiritual life. “What the Spirit says” is that you must confess
your known sins to God the Father and then be filled with the Holy Spirit (in
fellowship with God) to listen to the teaching of Bible doctrine. “To the
churches” the communication of Bible doctrine through a pastor-teacher per the
Scriptures.</p>

<p class=Verses>“‘He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the
churches.’““&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation 3:22, NASB)</p>
