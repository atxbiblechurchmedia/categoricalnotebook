<h2>Religion of the Galatians</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Before their salvation in Jesus Christ, the Galatians had
practiced many religions such as polytheism, libations, and had worked to satisfy
fallen angels or demons. Paul was concerned for the Galatians’ spiritual status
in Galatians 4:7-8 because they had slipped back into their pre-salvation
religious practices of legalism and worshipping of false gods. Paul was afraid
for them, lest his labor had been bestowed in vain. They had switched from
grace to legalism.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore you are no longer a slave, but a son; and if a son,
then an heir through God. However at that time, when you did not know God, you
were slaves to those which by nature are no gods.” (Galatians 4:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 8:44 and John 8:39-40, our Lord blasted the legalistic
Pharisees who opposed Him as the Messiah and sought to kill Him. Jesus Christ
called their legalism and Law-keeping practices (the Pharisees’ form of
religion at that time) as in opposition to the Old Testament Scriptures and in
opposition to Jesus Christ. Their religious practices substituted God's grace
and salvation by belief in the Messiah who would pay for their sins with
claiming they were saved by being born a Jew and by trying to keep the Mosaic
Law plus their added hyper-detailed rules from their “Oral Tradition” which
were not in the Old Testament Scriptures.</p>

<p class=Verses>“They answered and said to Him, &quot;Abraham is our
father.&quot; Jesus said to them, &quot;If you are Abraham's children, do the
deeds of Abraham. &quot;But as it is, you are seeking to kill Me, a man who has
told you the truth, which I heard from God; this Abraham did not do.” (John
8:39-40, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the
desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not
stand in the truth because there is no truth in him. Whenever he speaks a lie,
he speaks from his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies.” (John
8:44, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul had also warned the Corinthians about those who were
teaching false doctrines and called them false prophets and deceitful workers
in 2 Corinthians 11:13-15. See category on <a href="#_Legalism_in_Salvation">Legalism</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising
themselves as apostles of Christ. No wonder, for even Satan disguises himself
as an angel of light. Therefore it is not surprising if his servants also
disguise themselves as servants of righteousness, whose end will be according
to their deeds.” (2 Corinthians 11:13-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Galatians 4:9-11, Paul warns the Galatians of their
return to their pre-salvation religious ways. After they had accepted Jesus
Christ as their Savior, they had turned to the “weak and worthless elemental
things.” The weak elements refer to legalism, which is the production of human
good or good deeds as a means of spirituality which the Judaizers taught. The
Word of God teaches only one way to true spirituality - the confession of known
sins to God the Father via 1 John 1:9 which results in the filling of the Holy
Spirit.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known
by God, how is it that you turn back again to the weak and worthless elemental
things, to which you desire to be enslaved all over again? You observe days and
months and seasons and years. I fear for you, that perhaps I have labored over
you in vain.” (Galatians 4:9-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Legalism has never had any power to save or to glorify
Jesus Christ. The worthless elements refer to the Mosaic Law which had no power
to grow spiritually or to glorify God. Now, they were back to a works system,
observing days, months, times, and years. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They observed days (Sabbaths) with rituals and practices.
They observed four different religious festivals and fasts each on a designated
month. On the fourth month, they commemorated the fall and capture of
Jerusalem. On the fifth month, they commemorated the destruction of the temple
and Jerusalem. Jer. 39:2; Jer. 52:12-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, in the
ninth day of the month, the city wall was breached.” (Jeremiah 39:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now on the tenth day of the fifth month, which was the
nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan the
captain of the bodyguard, who was in the service of the king of Babylon, came
to Jerusalem. He burned the house of the LORD, the king's house and all the
houses of Jerusalem; even every large house he burned with fire.” (Jeremiah
52:12-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>On the seventh month, they commemorated the murder of
Gedaliah, the governor of the remnant of Jews. On the tenth month, they commemorated
Nebuchadnezzar’s siege of Jerusalem. Jer. 41:1; Jer. 39:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“In the seventh month Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of
Elishama, of the royal family and one of the chief officers of the king, along
with ten men, came to Mizpah to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. While they were
eating bread together there in Mizpah,” (Jeremiah 41:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now when Jerusalem was captured in the ninth year of Zedekiah
king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his
army came to Jerusalem and laid siege to it;” (Jeremiah 39:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Galatians celebrated Jewish feasts in the Old
Testament which were rituals God’s timetable for Israel all of which were
pictures or shadows of the Messiah to come. The feast of the Passover
celebrated the spiritual death of Jesus Christ on the Cross. The feast of Unleavened
Bread celebrated the fellowship of Jesus Christ. The feast of First Fruits
celebrated the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The feast of the Day of Pentecost celebrated the beginning
of the Church Age. The feast of Trumpets celebrated the Second Advent of Jesus
Christ yet to come and the regathering of the Jews in the Land. The feast of
Atonement celebrated the salvation of Israel. The feast of Tabernacles
celebrated the Millennial reign of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All of the Jewish feasts and accompanying rituals in the
Old Testament celebrated the coming of the Messiah, Jesus Christ to go to the
Cross to pay for the sins of mankind. Salvation was in the Old Testament by
non-meritorious faith belief in that future atoning work. Today in the Church
Age, salvation is the same, but we look back in time at the already completed
substitutionary spiritual death of Jesus Christ on the Cross as payment for the
sins of mankind. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Messiah, their Savior Jesus Christ had already come
in the person and work of Jesus Christ on the Cross. Old Testament Jewish
feasts and rituals are no longer necessary in the dispensation of the Church
Age. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The work of Jesus Christ on the Cross means is that sin
is no longer an issue, but either faith belief in that work or rejection of our
Lord’s saving work. Human actions or good deeds has nothing to do with
salvation and never has.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They observed years such as the Sabbatical year. Every seventh
year no work was done and the land was to lay fallow. The year of Jubilee was every
50th year, where all debts were cancelled, and all property reverted to its
original owner. This was only to be observed in the land of Palestine.</p>
