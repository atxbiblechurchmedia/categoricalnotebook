<h2><a name="_Rapture_of_the"></a><a name="_D-The_Rapture_of"></a><a
name="_The_Rapture_of"></a>The Rapture of the Church</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Rapture or Exit Resurrection of the Church is the
return of the Lord Jesus Christ for Church Age believers at the end of the
Church Age. Jesus Christ will be visible to believers only. The Rapture is
shown in the following diagram of the dispensations of human history.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'><img width=520
height=300 src="The%20Rapture%20of%20the%20Church1.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All Church Age believers (also members of the Body of
Christ) who have died physically prior to the Rapture will be raised first and
then those who remain alive on earth will be caught up to meet our Lord in the
air. All believers alive on earth at the time of the Rapture, regardless of
their spiritual status at the time (spiritual or carnal), will meet our Lord in
the air. Our Lord Jesus Christ does not touch the earth. Heb. 2:10; 1 Thess. 4:16-17;
Acts 1:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things, and
through whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to perfect the
author of their salvation through sufferings.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 2:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout,
with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in
Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up
together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we shall
always be with the Lord.” (1 Thessalonians 4:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“They also said, &quot;Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking
into the sky? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come
in just the same way as you have watched Him go into heaven.&quot;” (Acts 1:11,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All Church Age believers receive a resurrection body that
has no old sin nature. 1 Cor. 15:51-57.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Behold, I tell you a mystery; we will not all sleep, but
we will all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last
trumpet; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable,
and we will be changed. For this perishable must put on the imperishable, and
this mortal must put on immortality. But when this perishable will have put on
the imperishable, and this mortal will have put on immortality, then will come
about the saying that is written, &quot;DEATH IS SWALLOWED UP in victory.
&quot;O DEATH, WHERE IS YOUR VICTORY? O DEATH, WHERE IS YOUR STING?&quot; The
sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law; but thanks be to God,
who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.&quot;  (1 Corinthians
15:51-57, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Rapture involves Church Age believers only. All
Church Age believers are members of the Body of Jesus Christ by the Holy Spirit
at salvation when He entered each believer into union with Jesus Christ
(Baptism of the Spirit). Christ is the head of the body, the Church. Jesus
Christ comes to receive His Church at the Rapture. The Church is a mystery
doctrine, not revealed in the Old Testament. 1 Cor. 12:12-13; Col. 1:18; Eph.
3:1-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For even as the body is one and yet has many members, and all
the members of the body, though they are many, are one body, so also is Christ.
For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks,
whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one Spirit.” (1
Corinthians 12:12-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He is also head of the body, the church; and He is the
beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that He Himself will come to have
first place in everything.” (Colossians 1:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the
sake of you Gentiles— if indeed you have heard of the stewardship of God's
grace which was given to me for you; that by revelation there was made known to
me the mystery, as I wrote before in brief. By referring to this, when you read
you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ, which in other
generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed
to His holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit;” (Ephesians 3:1-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Rapture of the Church was prophesied and promised by
the Lord Jesus Christ on the eve of His crucifixion. John 14:1-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Do not let your heart be troubled; believe in God,
believe also in Me. &quot;In My Father's house are many dwelling places; if it
were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you.
&quot;If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to
Myself, that where I am, there you may be also.” (John 14:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The time element for the Rapture is unknown. It will
occur when the number of believers are sufficient to complete the formation of
the Body of Christ. Only God knows that number. Eph. 2:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;in whom the whole building, being fitted together, is
growing into a holy temple in the Lord,&quot;  (Ephesians 2:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers go to heaven where their work will be evaluated
at the Judgment Seat of Christ while the Tribulation is taking place on earth.
2 Cor. 5:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so
that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body, according to what
he has done, whether good or bad.” (2 Corinthians 5:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the Rapture, there will be no dealing with sin and
evil on the earth. At the Rapture, there will be no changes in nature. Israel’s
unconditional covenants will still remain unfulfilled.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Our Guarantee of Resurrection At the Rapture</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every human being (except Jesus Christ) is born
spiritually dead because of the sin of Adam in the Garden. The result of faith
belief in the work of Jesus Christ on the Cross for our sins, we have spiritual
life in Him. 1 Cor. 15:20-23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits
of those who are asleep. For since by a man came death, by a man also came the
resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be
made alive. But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, after that
those who are Christ's at His coming,” (1 Corinthians 15:20-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Rapture is the completion of the redemption of the
body. The believer receives a resurrection body exactly like that of Jesus
Christ, which is called Ultimate Sanctification. The resurrection of our Lord
Jesus Christ from the dead as the “first fruits” is our guarantee of our bodily
physical resurrection at the Rapture. Phil. 3:20-21; 1 John 3:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For our citizenship is in heaven, from which also we eagerly
wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ; who will transform the body of our
humble state into conformity with the body of His glory, by the exertion of the
power that He has even to subject all things to Himself.” (Philippians 3:20-21,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“See how great a love the Father has bestowed on us, that we
would be called children of God; and such we are. For this reason the world
does not know us, because it did not know Him. Beloved, now we are children of
God, and it has not appeared as yet what we will be. We know that when He
appears, we will be like Him, because we will see Him just as He is.” (1 John
3:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Enoch Was an Example of Miraculous Translation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Enoch was the first man ever to be transferred or
translated miraculously from one place to another and changed from one form to
another. Gen. 5:24; Heb. 11:5. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Enoch walked with God; and he was not, for God took him.”
(Genesis 5:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“By faith Enoch was taken up so that he would not see death;
AND HE WAS NOT FOUND BECAUSE GOD TOOK HIM UP; for he obtained the witness that
before his being taken up he was pleasing to God.” (Hebrews 11:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Enoch did not die like the others before him like Adam,
Seth, Enosh, and Kenan. Gen. 5:5; Gen. 5:8; Gen. 5:11; Gen. 5:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty
years, and he died.” (Genesis 5:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years,
and he died.” (Genesis 5:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years, and
he died.” (Genesis 5:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So all the days of Kenan were nine hundred and ten years, and
he died.” (Genesis 5:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Enoch was taken to Paradise because, according to John
3:13, no believer had ascended to the third heaven prior to our Lord Jesus
Christ. Remember, this was written before the Cross, resurrection, ascension,
and session of Jesus Christ. Enoch lived a long time prior to the writing of
John 3:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;No one has ascended into heaven, but He who descended
from heaven: the Son of Man.” (John 3:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It was God who made this miraculous translation possible
and it is God who will bring it about again at the Rapture of the Church when all
Church Age believers will receive resurrection bodies that will live forever.
Our resurrection bodies will be the same as that of the Lord Jesus Christ. This
will not be resuscitation where the person dies again as did Lazarus. We will
be changed forever. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Waiting for the Rapture</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every believer has a reservation in heaven guaranteed by
God’s promise. 1 Peter 1:4; Eph. 2:6. </p>

<p class=Verses>“to obtain an inheritance which is imperishable and undefiled
and will not fade away, reserved in heaven for you,” (1 Peter 1:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and raised us up with Him, and seated us with Him in the
heavenly places in Christ Jesus,” (Ephesians 2:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All Church Age believers as members of the Church endure
testing in their spiritual life because the Body of Christ is the target for
the Angelic Conflict. The Rapture is the Christian’s hope and a source of
comfort. 1 Thess. 1:10; 1 Thess. 4:18; Titus 2:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and to wait for His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the
dead, that is Jesus, who rescues us from the wrath to come.” (1 Thessalonians
1:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore comfort one another with these words.” (1
Thessalonians 4:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of
our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus,” (Titus 2:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are to focus on consistent intake and application of
the Word of God in our spiritual life. Spiritual growth and the fulfillment of
God's plan for our lives is our purpose for being here on this earth. We can
anticipate the return of our Lord at the Rapture, but our spiritual growth is
to be the top priority in life. 2 Thess. 2:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now we request you, brethren, with regard to the coming of our
Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him, that you not be quickly
shaken from your composure or be disturbed either by a spirit or a message or a
letter as if from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has come.” (2
Thessalonians 2:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are to learn to have patience by living the faith-rest
life and using God's grace resources to deal with people, to solve our problems
in life, and to make good decisions. We are to have confidence that the Rapture
will occur and we will receive our resurrection bodies. James 5:7-8; Phil. 1:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore be patient, brethren, until the coming of the Lord.
The farmer waits for the precious produce of the soil, being patient about it,
until it gets the early and late rains. You too be patient; strengthen your
hearts, for the coming of the Lord is near.” (James 5:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For I am confident of this very thing, that He who began a
good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus.” (Philippians
1:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are commanded to stay in fellowship (abide in Him)
filled with the Holy Spirit and growing spiritually whereby we gain in the <i>epignosis</i>
knowledge of God through His Word. 1 John 2:28; Col. 1:9-10. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Now, little children, abide in Him, so that when He appears,
we may have confidence and not shrink away from Him in shame at His coming.” (1
John 2:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason also, since the day we heard of it, we have
not ceased to pray for you and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge
of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding, so that you will walk in
a manner worthy of the Lord, to please Him in all respects, bearing fruit in
every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God;” (Colossians 1:9-10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual growth brings stability and spiritual
discernment to the believer’s life. Isaiah 33:6; 2 Tim. 2:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He will be the stability of your times, A wealth of
salvation, wisdom and knowledge; The fear of the LORD is his treasure.” (Isaiah
33:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman
who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth.” (2
Timothy 2:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Distinctions Between the Rapture and the Second Advent</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b><img width=500 height=600 id="Picture 1"
src="The%20Rapture%20of%20the%20Church2.png"></b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Rapture involves the removal of all believers from
the earth. The Second Advent involves the removal of all unbelievers from the
earth. Matt. 24:37-43.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For the coming of the Son of Man will be just like the
days of Noah. &quot;For as in those days before the flood they were eating and
drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the
ark, and they did not understand until the flood came and took them all away;
so will the coming of the Son of Man be. &quot;Then there will be two men in
the field; one will be taken and one will be left. &quot;Two women will be
grinding at the mill; one will be taken and one will be left. &quot;Therefore
be on the alert, for you do not know which day your Lord is coming. &quot;But
be sure of this, that if the head of the house had known at what time of the
night the thief was coming, he would have been on the alert and would not have
allowed his house to be broken into.” (Matthew 24:37-43, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Rapture pictures the Church Age saints caught up to
meet Jesus Christ in the air. At the Second Advent, our Lord Jesus Christ
physically returns to earth at the Mount of Olives. Acts 1:11; Zech. 14:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“They also said, &quot;Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking
into the sky? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come
in just the same way as you have watched Him go into heaven.&quot;” (Acts 1:11,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“In that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which
is in front of Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split in
its middle from east to west by a very large valley, so that half of the
mountain will move toward the north and the other half toward the south.”
(Zechariah 14:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the Rapture, Christ comes to claim His bride – the
Church. In the Second Advent He returns <u>with</u> His bride – the Church. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the Rapture, the Church goes to heaven. At the Second
Advent, the Church returns with Christ. John 14:3; 1 Thess. 3:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again
and receive you to Myself, that where I am, there you may be also.” (John 14:3,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“so that He may establish your hearts without blame in holiness
before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all His saints.”
(1 Thessalonians 3:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the Rapture, the Church Age believers’ bodies will be
changed. At the Second Advent, the earth will be changed. Phil 3:21; Zech. 14:9;
Rom. 8:19-22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“who will transform the body of our humble state into
conformity with the body of His glory, by the exertion of the power that He has
even to subject all things to Himself.” (Philippians 3:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the LORD will be king over all the earth; in that day the
LORD will be the only one, and His name the only one.” (Zechariah 14:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the anxious longing of the creation waits eagerly for the
revealing of the sons of God. For the creation was subjected to futility, not
willingly, but because of Him who subjected it, in hope that the creation
itself also will be set free from its slavery to corruption into the freedom of
the glory of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groans
and suffers the pains of childbirth together until now.” (Romans 8:19-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Following the Rapture, Church Age believers will be
judged for their use of God's grace resources while alive on earth at the
Judgment Seat of Christ. At the Second Advent, unbelieving Gentiles and Jews
will be judged and removed from the earth -the Baptism of Fire. 2 Cor. 5:10; Matt.
3:11-12; Luke 3:16-17; 2 Thess. 1:7-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>““As for me, I baptize you with water for repentance, but He
who is coming after me is mightier than I, and I am not fit to remove His
sandals; He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. “His winnowing fork
is in His hand, and He will thoroughly clear His threshing floor; and He will
gather His wheat into the barn, but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable
fire.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 3:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“John answered and said to them all, “As for me, I baptize you
with water; but One is coming who is mightier than I, and I am not fit to untie
the thong of His sandals; He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. “His
winnowing fork is in His hand to thoroughly clear His threshing floor, and to
gather the wheat into His barn; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable
fire.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Luke 3:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and to give relief to you who are afflicted and to us as well
when the Lord Jesus will be revealed from heaven with His mighty angels in
flaming fire, dealing out retribution to those who do not know God and to those
who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. These will pay the penalty of
eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of
His power,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Thessalonians 1:7-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Following the Rapture, the restraining ministry of the Holy
Spirit will be removed. At the Second Advent, Satan is removed from the earth
for 1,000 years. 2 Thess. 2:6; Rev. 20:1-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And you know what restrains him now, so that in his time he
will be revealed.” (2 Thessalonians 2:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding the key
of the abyss and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold of the dragon, the
serpent of old, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years;
and he threw him into the abyss, and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he
would not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were
completed; after these things he must be released for a short time.”
(Revelation 20:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Rapture results in the removal of the Church and the
inception of the Tribulation. The Second Advent results in the establishment of
the Millennial Kingdom of Jesus Christ on earth.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Rapture is imminent, while the Second Advent is
preceded by many signs in the Tribulation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Rapture brings a message of comfort to Church Age
believers, while the Second Advent is accompanied by a message of judgment and
a time of terror. Rev. 6:15‑17. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the kings of the earth and the great men and the
commanders and the rich and the strong and every slave and free man hid
themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains;” (Revelation
6:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Rapture is related to the program for the Church,
while the Second Advent is related to the program for Israel and the world. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Rapture is a mystery while the Second Advent is
predicted in the Old and New Testaments.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Rapture is the end of the Church Age. The Second
Advent is the end of the Jewish Age.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Rapture leaves creation unchanged while the Second
Advent entails the change in creation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the Rapture, Gentiles are unaffected while at the
Second Advent Gentiles are judged. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the Rapture, Israel is under the fifth cycle of
discipline. The Second Advent terminates the fifth cycle of discipline of
Israel.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the Rapture, Israel’s unconditional covenants are
unfulfilled, but at the Second Advent all of Israel’s unconditional covenants
will be fulfilled.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Rapture is for believers only, but the Second Advent
has its effect on believers and unbelievers. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Rapture is said to take place before the day of wrath
(the 7-year Tribulation), but the Second Advent follows it.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The expectation of the Church with regard to the Rapture
is “the Lord is at hand,” while the expectation of Israel with regard to the
Second Advent is “the kingdom is at hand.” Matt. 24:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the
whole world as a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will
come.&quot;  (Matthew 24:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The expectation of the Church at the translation is to be
taken into the Lord’s presence, while the expectation of Israel at the Second
Advent is to be taken into the kingdom. Thus, there must be two different
programs - the first being the Rapture and the second one being the Second
Advent.</p>
