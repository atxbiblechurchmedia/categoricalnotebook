<h2>Religion, Cause of Perilous Times - Privilege Without Responsibility</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>General Douglas MacArthur on June 2, 1931 made this
speech based on the fact that 19,372 clergymen were opposed at that time to any
form of military activity and wanted the military abolished and this country
disarmed. MacArthur at that time was Chief of Staff in this country (1930-35).
As Chief of Staff, he felt some responsibility to answer these clergymen.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>“My predominant feelings with reference to the
majority of replies received from your paper by 19,372 clergymen is that of
surprise. Surprise that the knowledge of so many of our clergymen of our
country have placed themselves on record as repudiating in advance the
constitutional obligations that will fall upon them equally with all other
elements of our citizenship in supporting this country in case of need. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>To exercise privilege without assuming attendant
responsibility and obligation is to occupy a position of license, a position
sought by men who apparently do not hesitate to avail themselves of the
privileges conferred by our democracy upon its citizens, but who in effect
proclaimed their willingness to see this nation perish, rather than participate
in its defense. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>The question of war and peace is one that rests under
our form of government in Congress. And exercising this authority, Congress
voices the will of the majority whose right to rule is the cornerstone upon
which our governmental edifice is built. Under the constitution, its
pronouncement upon such an issue is final and is obligatory upon every citizen
of the United States. That men who wear the cloth of the church should openly
defend repudiation of the laws of the land with the necessary implications and
ramifications arising from such a general attitude towards our statutes seems
to me almost unbelievable.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>It will certainly hearten every potential or actual
criminal and malefactor who either has, or contemplates breaking some law. It
apparently stamps the clergyman as a leading exponent of law violation at
individual pleasure.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>I am mindful of the right accorded to every American
citizen to endeavor by lawful means to secure such changes in the constitution
or statues as he may desire, but to concede to him the right to defy existing
laws, to recognize a state of anarchy and collapse of properly constituted
authority is not right. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>May I remark also, that if we acknowledge the
prerogative of the individual to disregard the obligations placed upon him by
American citizenship, it seems only logical to ask him to forgo all rights
guaranteed by such citizenship. It also surprises me that, while apparently
entering a plea for freedom of conscience, these clergymen are attempting to
dictate to the conscience of those who honestly differ from them over questions
of national defense. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Their sentiments and implied efforts are injecting the
church into the affairs of state and endangering the very principles that they
claim to uphold.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Perhaps the greatest privilege of our country which
indeed was the genius of its foundation is religion freedom. Religious freedom
however can only exist so long as governments survive. To render our country
helpless would invite destruction not only of our political and economic
freedom but also our religious freedom. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Another surprise comes in the revelation that so many
clergymen seem to be unfamiliar with the struggle of mankind for the free
institutions which we enjoy. The Magna Charta, the Declaration of Independence,
the Emancipation of the rights of Small Nations, and other birthrights of this
generation have been bought with a high price of human suffering and human
sacrifice, much of it on the fields of battle.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>I’m surprised that men of clear and logical minds
confuse defensive warfare with the disease which it alone can cure when all
other remedies have failed. Do they not know that police systems in our
national defenses are the human agencies made necessary by the deep-seated
disease of individual depravity; the menace of greed and of personal hatred. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Should not these clergymen turn their attention to the
individual sinner and rid the country of crime rather than attack the national
keepers of peace, the most potent government agency yet devised for this
purpose (military). </i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>It is a distinct disappointment to know that men who
are called to wield the sword of the Spirit are deluded into believing that the
mechanical expedient of disarming men will transform hatred into love and
selfishness into altruism. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>May I also express surprise that some have lost sight
of the fact that in one of our past wars have clergymen been required to bear
arms, and under the terms of the Geneva Convention ratified by the United
States in 1907 Chaplains are non-combatants and are not authorized to bear
arms. And if the US Army chaplains are ever guilty of using inflammatory
propaganda such activity is without warrant or authority by any statute or
order ever promulgated in the history of his country. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>I am curious to know how many of the clergymen who
voted for the League of Nations have read the articles and understand that
under them that the peace of the world is to be maintained in the last analysis
by an armed military force. It is difficult to reconcile the faith of these
people in the efficacy of newly organized international agencies to keep the
peace and enforce respect for international covenants with their self-confessed
intention to violate the existing laws of their long established government.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>A few questions occur to me that could appropriately
be asked the clergymen who replied to your questionnaire. In stating that they
were in favor of the United States taking the lead in reducing armament, even
if compelled to make greater proportionate reductions than other countries -
would they be willing to do this if they knew that the existing total of our
land forces including Regular Army, National Guard, and organized reserves is
about 1/3rd of 1% of our regular population.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Did they know that in other great countries, except
Germany (1931) whose army is limited by treaty, this ratio is from 3 to 45
times as great. Did they know our total forces in actual size are exceeded by
those of at least 15 other nations, although in population we are exceeded only
by Russia, China, and India?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Finally, did they consider the words of our Lord as
given in the 21st verse of the 11th chapter of St. Luke, “When a strong man
armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace.” In all modesty may I not say
to the opponents of our national defense that our Lord who preached the Sermon
on the Mount later in His career declared, “Think not that I am come to send
peace on earth, I am come not to send peace, but a sword.” Matthew 10:34. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>It is my humble belief that the relation which He came
to establish is based upon sacrifice . . . then He goes on and applies . . .
that men and women who follow in His train are called by it to the defense of
certain priceless principles even at the cost of their own lives. I can think
of no principles no more high and holy than those for which our national
sacrifices have been made in the past. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>History teaches us that Christianity and patriotism
have always gone hand in hand while atheism has been invariably accompanied by
radicalism, communism, bolshevism, and other enemies of free government. Have
not those who oppose our modest and reasonable efforts for national defense
miscalculated the temper and innate spirit of patriotism in the average
American. </i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>The fact that our Citizen’s Military Training Camps
are oversubscribed long before the opening of the camps comfort me that
patriotism is still dominant in the land. (1931) </i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Any organization which opposes the defense of homeland
and the principles hallowed by the blood of our ancestors which sets up
internationalism in the place of patriotism, which teaches the passive
submission of right to the forces of predatory strong, cannot prevail against
the demonstrated staunchness of our position. I confidently believe that a
red-blooded virile human which loves peace devotedly but is willing to die in
the defense of the right is a Christian from center to circumference and will continue
to be dominant in the future as in the past.”</i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>---------</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Why are clergymen this way? Because of religion! Because
the thinking of this country is trained by religion. Because our educational
system from the first grade through the college level is influenced by
liberalism, the social action concept, the whole bit that MacArthur warns us
about is here again, only with much greater intensity this time. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Frankly, things are so bad right now, our only hope is a
resurgence of positive volition toward Bible doctrine. Even a conversion of
clergy would help. It would help even if the clergymen who are converted could
give the plan of salvation accurately and learn five basic doctrines. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the meantime, our high schools are filled with kids
experimenting with all kinds of drugs. In the meantime, there is a fantastic
reaction to authority and its order. The Word of God taught is the answer to
our problems. Then, it must be applied. 2 Tim. 3:8-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men also
oppose the truth, men of depraved mind, rejected in regard to the faith. But
they will not make further progress; for their folly will be obvious to all,
just as Jannes’s and Jambres’s folly was also. Now you followed my teaching,
conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, perseverance, persecutions, and
sufferings, such as happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium and at Lystra; what
persecutions I endured, and out of them all the Lord rescued me! Indeed, all
who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted. But evil men and
impostors will proceed from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived.”  (2
Timothy 3:8-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We have religion as the cause of perilous times. Perilous
times is the coming of the fifth cycle of discipline or the destruction of a
national entity. Religion was the great hang-up in the days of Paul and also in
the days of Moses. Moses was the greatest man in the Old Testament field of
Bible teaching, Paul in the New Testament. They both had considerable opposition.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Religion has always been the devil’s ace for opposition
to Bible doctrine. Moses and Paul were communicators as well as vehicles for
the human authorship of some of the Scriptures. 2 Timothy 3:8 deals with
opposition to Moses and to Paul and the source of that opposition to both men was
religion. Paul had nothing to hide in his life. His invisible Christianity is
visible in all for vindication purposes. Religion is the biggest con-game ever
devised by the human race, of course, instigated by Satan. </p>
