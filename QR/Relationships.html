<h2>Relationships</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God the Father to the Human Race</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The human race is made up of believers and unbelievers. God
the Father is the God of the entire human race on the basis of creation whether
acknowledged or not. All souls belong to God. Jer. 32:27; Ezekiel 18:4; Daniel
5:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh; is anything
too difficult for Me?&quot;” (Jeremiah 32:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Behold, all souls are Mine; the soul of the father as
well as the soul of the son is Mine. The soul who sins will die.” (Ezekiel
18:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“but you have exalted yourself against the Lord of heaven; and
they have brought the vessels of His house before you, and you and your nobles,
your wives and your concubines have been drinking wine from them; and you have
praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood and stone, which do
not see, hear or understand. But the God in whose hand are your life-breath and
all your ways, you have not glorified.” (Daniel 5:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Father is the Father of all believers by their
faith in Jesus Christ. God the Father is not the father of unbelievers. The
father of the unbeliever is Satan. Gal. 3:26; John 20:17; John 8:43-44.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.”
(Galatians 3:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Jesus said to her, &quot;Stop clinging to Me, for I have not
yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brethren and say to them, 'I ascend to
My Father and your Father, and My God and your God.'&quot;” (John 20:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Why do you not understand what I am saying? It is
because you cannot hear My word. &quot;You are of your father the devil, and
you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the
beginning, and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him.
Whenever he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own nature, for he is a liar and
the father of lies.” (John 8:43-44, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer has assurance that they are children of God and
nothing can ever remove the child of God from their new position in Christ. Rom.
8:16; Rom. 8:38-39.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are
children of God,” (Romans 8:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels,
nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor
height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us
from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Romans 8:38-39,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>No human being has the power to make himself a child of
God. This transforming power belongs to God alone and is conditional upon the
simple act of faith in the atoning work of Jesus Christ on the Cross. John
1:12-13; Gal. 3:26.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to
become children of God, even to those who believe in His name, who were born,
not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.”
(John 1:12-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.”
(Galatians 3:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Birth into God’s family by faith in the work of Jesus
Christ on the Cross makes Him our Father. The unbeliever addresses God the
Father as “God” while the believer can call the Sovereign of the universe “Father.”
This is a privilege of believers only. Titus 3:5; John 3:5-6; 1 John 3:1-2; 1
Peter 1:23; Rom. 8:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done in
righteousness, but according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration and
renewing by the Holy Spirit,” (Titus 3:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Jesus answered, &quot;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one
is born of water and the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
&quot;That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the
Spirit is spirit.” (John 3:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“See how great a love the Father has bestowed on us, that we
would be called children of God; and such we are. For this reason the world
does not know us, because it did not know Him. Beloved, now we are children of
God, and it has not appeared as yet what we will be. We know that when He
appears, we will be like Him, because we will see Him just as He is.” (1 John
3:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“for you have been born again not of seed which is perishable
but imperishable, that is, through the living and enduring word of God.” (1
Peter 1:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For you have not received a spirit of slavery leading to fear
again, but you have received a spirit of adoption as sons by which we cry out,
&quot;Abba! Father!&quot;” (Romans 8:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Because He is our Father, we have the love of the Father and
the provision of the Father. John 16:27; Matt. 7:11; Col. 1:12; 1 John 1:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“for the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me
and have believed that I came forth from the Father.” (John 16:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to
your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give what is
good to those who ask Him!” (Matthew 7:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified us to share in
the inheritance of the saints in Light.” (Colossians 1:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“This is the message we have heard from Him and announce to
you, that God is Light, and in Him there is no darkness at all.” (1 John 1:5,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Believer With Jesus Christ </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All Church Age believers are placed into permanent union
with Jesus Christ at salvation by the Holy Spirit (Baptism of the Holy Spirit).
In union with Christ, we share His eternal life and His absolute righteousness
(+R). 1 John 5:11-12; 2 Cor. 5:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the testimony is this, that God has given us eternal life,
and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has the life; he who does not
have the Son of God does not have the life.” (1 John 5:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that
we might become the righteousness of God in Him.” (2 Corinthians 5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Church Age believers also share Christ’s Sonship and
Heirship. Gal. 3:26; Rom. 8:16-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.”
(Galatians 3:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are
children of God, and if children, heirs also, heirs of God and fellow heirs
with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him so that we may also be glorified with
Him.” (Romans 8:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Church Age believers share our Lord’s election, His
destiny, and His sanctification. 1 Peter 1:2; Eph. 1:5; Eph. 1:11; 1 Cor. 1:2. </p>

<p class=Verses>“according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by the
sanctifying work of the Spirit, to obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with His
blood: May grace and peace be yours in the fullest measure.” (1 Peter 1:2,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to
Himself, according to the kind intention of His will,” (Ephesians 1:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“also we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined
according to His purpose who works all things after the counsel of His will,”
(Ephesians 1:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“To the church of God which is at Corinth, to those who have
been sanctified in Christ Jesus, saints by calling, with all who in every place
call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours:” (1 Corinthians
1:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Church Age believers share the priesthood and kingship of
Jesus Christ. 1 Peter 2:5; 1 Peter 2:9; 2 Peter 1:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“you also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual
house for a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
through Jesus Christ.” (1 Peter 2:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But you are A CHOSEN RACE, A royal PRIESTHOOD, A HOLY NATION,
A PEOPLE FOR God's OWN POSSESSION, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of
Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;” (1 Peter 2:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“for in this way the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be abundantly supplied to you.” (2 Peter
1:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God the Father to the Lord Jesus Christ</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Scripture, the name of our Lord Jesus Christ is used
with differing reference and emphasis. “Christ” refers to His deity and “Christ
Jesus” emphasizes His deity. “The Lord Jesus Christ” refers to the God-Man-Savior.
“Jesus” refers to His humanity and “Jesus Christ” emphasizes His humanity. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is an acknowledged two-fold relationship between
the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Psalms 2:7; Heb. 1:5; 1 Peter 1:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I will surely tell of the decree of the LORD: He said to
Me, 'You are My Son, Today I have begotten You.” (Psalms 2:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For to which of the angels did He ever say, &quot;YOU ARE MY
SON, TODAY I HAVE BEGOTTEN YOU&quot;? And again, &quot;I WILL BE A FATHER TO
HIM AND HE SHALL BE A SON TO ME&quot;?” (Hebrews 1:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope
through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,” (1 Peter 1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Jesus Christ’s deity, there is a Father-Son
relationship making Christ Jesus the Son from eternity past. Matt. 16:16; Rom.
15:6; Isaiah 9:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Simon Peter answered, &quot;You are the Christ, the Son of the
living God.&quot;” (Matthew 16:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“so that with one accord you may with one voice glorify the God
and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.” (Romans 15:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us; And
the government will rest on His shoulders; And His name will be called
Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.” (Isaiah 9:6,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Jesus Christ’s humanity, there is a Father-Son
relationship and a God-man relationship. Luke 1:35; Isaiah 9:6; Heb. 10:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The angel answered and said to her, &quot;The Holy Spirit will
come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; and for that
reason the holy Child shall be called the Son of God.” (Luke 1:35, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us; And
the government will rest on His shoulders; And His name will be called
Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.” (Isaiah 9:6,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;THEN I SAID, 'BEHOLD, I HAVE COME (IN THE SCROLL OF THE
BOOK IT IS WRITTEN OF ME) TO DO YOUR WILL, O GOD.'&quot;” (Hebrews 10:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord Jesus Christ’s response to the first person of
the Trinity (God the Father) was that He declared that His Father was God the
Father and that He was the Son of God who has been with the Father from
eternity past. Jesus Christ willingly offered Himself as a substitute for God
the Father’s judgment of the sins of the human race. Our Lord became obedient
even to death on the Cross. John 1:18; John 1:11; Heb. 9:14; Phil. 2:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“No one has seen God at any time; the only begotten God who is
in the bosom of the Father, He has explained Him.” (John 1:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He came to His own, and those who were His own did not receive
Him.” (John 1:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the
eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience
from dead works to serve the living God?” (Hebrews 9:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by
becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.” (Philippians
2:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Jesus Christ to Angels</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Prior to the Lord Jesus Christ’s incarnation, He appeared
on earth as the Angel of Jehovah. See Category on <a
href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/C/Christophany%20or%20Theophany.html">Christophany or Theophany</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the pre-ascension period of our Lord’s incarnation,
God the Son took on Himself humanity. He took on the form of lower creation - humanity.
He became the unique God-Man. Heb. 2:9; Phil. 2:5-8. See category on the <a
href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/H/Hypostatic%20Union%20of%20Jesus%20Christ.html">Hypostatic Union of Jesus Christ</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But we do see Him who was made for a little while lower than
the angels, namely, Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory
and honor, so that by the grace of God He might taste death for everyone.”
(Hebrews 2:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ
Jesus, who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality
with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a
bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men. Being found in appearance
as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even
death on a cross.” (Philippians 2:5-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>After the ascension of Jesus Christ, the resurrected
Christ, the God-Man is higher than angels. Because as believers, we are heirs
of salvation in Christ, we are positionally higher than angels. This is why each
believer has a guardian angel. In Hebrews 1:14, “ministering spirits” are
guardian angels assigned to each believer. 1 Peter 3:22; Heb. 1:13-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven,
after angels and authorities and powers had been subjected to Him.” (1 Peter
3:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But to which of the angels has He ever said, &quot;SIT AT MY
RIGHT HAND, UNTIL I MAKE YOUR ENEMIES A FOOTSTOOL FOR YOUR FEET&quot;? Are they
not all ministering spirits, sent out to render service for the sake of those
who will inherit salvation?” (Hebrews 1:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Man to Angels</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Old Testament, angels were called “sons of God” and
believers were called “servants of God.” Job 1:6; Daniel 3:26.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present
themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them.” (Job 1:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the door of the furnace of
blazing fire; he responded and said, &quot;Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego,
come out, you servants of the Most High God, and come here!&quot; Then
Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego came out of the midst of the fire.” (Daniel
3:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the New Testament, because of Positional Truth,
believers are called “sons” and angels are called “servants.” Gal. 3:26; Heb.
1:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.”
(Galatians 3:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Are they not all ministering spirits, sent out to render
service for the sake of those who will inherit salvation?” (Hebrews 1:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Man was created lower than angels. Jesus Christ was made
lower than angels when He took on the form of humanity so that He might provide
salvation for mankind. Heb. 2:7; Heb. 2:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;YOU HAVE MADE HIM FOR A LITTLE WHILE LOWER THAN THE
ANGELS; YOU HAVE CROWNED HIM WITH GLORY AND HONOR, AND HAVE APPOINTED HIM OVER
THE WORKS OF YOUR HANDS;” (Hebrews 2:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But we do see Him who was made for a little while lower than
the angels, namely, Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory
and honor, so that by the grace of God He might taste death for everyone.”
(Hebrews 2:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Man was created to resolve the Angelic Conflict by
accepting the provision of salvation through the non-meritorious act of faith
in the atoning work of Jesus Christ on the Cross for their sins. This greatest
act of unconditional love of God the Father toward mankind was to send His only
Son to take on the form of humanity in our Lord’s incarnation. The believer’s
free will acceptance by faith alone in Christ alone proved that God was fair in
sentencing Satan to the Lake of Fire because Satan went negative against God’s
provision for him and for all angels.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Church Age, satanic activity (demon activity)
toward the Church (the Body of Christ) is much more concentrated than in any
prior dispensation in history. While believers in the Church Age die at
different times, all will get their resurrection bodies at the same time - at
the Rapture of the Church. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/QR/The%20Rapture%20of%20the%20Church.html">The
Rapture of the Church</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Regenerate man, because of their position in Christ, are
now positionally higher than angels. Believers in the Church Age have this
position in Christ for a reason. Jesus Christ became the heir when He was
seated at the right hand of God the Father. It is necessary for the “joint-heirs
with Christ” to be superior to angels and still live on this earth.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>After the Rapture of the Church and into eternity, all believers
in resurrection bodies will be both positionally higher and physically higher than
angels. This is because each will have a body exactly like that of the Lord
Jesus Christ, and He, in resurrection body, is higher than angels. Phil. 3:21; Heb.
1:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“who will transform the body of our humble state into
conformity with the body of His glory, by the exertion of the power that He has
even to subject all things to Himself.” (Philippians 3:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But to which of the angels has He ever said, &quot;SIT AT MY
RIGHT HAND, UNTIL I MAKE YOUR ENEMIES A FOOTSTOOL FOR YOUR FEET&quot;?”
(Hebrews 1:13, NASB)</p>
