<h2><a name="_Rewards_1"></a><a name="_D-Rewards"></a>Rewards</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>On what basis does God bestow rewards to the believer? Rewards
are based on staying in fellowship and using God's grace resources in the
spiritual life including the function of spiritual gifts. Rewards are bestowed
at the Judgment Seat of Christ. 2 Cor. 5:10; Rom. 14:10; 1 Cor. 3:11-13. Rewards
are often illustrated by crowns. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/C/Crowns.html">Crowns</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so
that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body, according to what
he has done, whether good or bad.” (2 Corinthians 5:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But you, why do you judge your brother? Or you again, why do
you regard your brother with contempt? For we will all stand before the
judgment seat of God.” (Romans 14:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For no man can lay a foundation other than the one which is
laid, which is Jesus Christ. Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold,
silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, each man's work will become evident;
for the day will show it because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire
itself will test the quality of each man's work.” (1 Corinthians 3:11-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You can lose rewards, but you can never lose your
salvation. 1 Cor. 3:14-15; 2 Tim. 2:12-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If any man's work which he has built on it remains, he will
receive a reward. If any man's work is burned up, he will suffer loss; but he
himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.” (1 Corinthians 3:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we endure, we will also reign with Him; If we deny Him, He
also will deny us; If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny
Himself.” (2 Timothy 2:12-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Judgment Seat of Christ takes place after the Rapture
of the Church while the Tribulation is unfolding on the earth. Rev. 19:7-8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Let us rejoice and be glad and give the glory to Him,
for the marriage of the Lamb has come and His bride has made herself
ready.&quot; It was given to her to clothe herself in fine linen, bright and
clean; for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.” (Revelation
19:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 19:27, Peter is looking at the doctrine of
rewards, but with a false emphasis. He is telling the Lord how great he is and
how the Lord ought to reward him.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Peter said to Him, &quot;Behold, we have left everything
and followed You; what then will there be for us?&quot;” (Matthew 19:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord was emphasizing regeneration, then He talked
about the reign of the apostles in eternity and their maximum rewards. Every
believer has exactly the same position in Christ, the same responsibilities, the
same grace resources, except in the field of spiritual gifts.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And Jesus said to them, &quot;Truly I say to you, that you who
have followed Me, in the regeneration when the Son of Man will sit on His
glorious throne, you also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve
tribes of Israel. &quot;And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters
or father or mother or children or farms for My name's sake, will receive many
times as much, and will inherit eternal life.” (Matthew 19:28-29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Faithfulness or the utilization of God's grace resources
is the basis of rewards, not success. This means that legalism, which is the
enemy of grace, will keep many prominent believers from rewards in eternity.
Legalism can only produce human good and human good is not rewarded. It will be
revealed at the Judgment Seat of Christ. Legalism keeps the believer from
depending upon the filling of the Holy Spirit. Instead, legalism causes the
believer to depend on their area of strength and on their human good production.
1 Cor. 3:12-15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold, silver,
precious stones, wood, hay, straw, each man's work will become evident; for the
day will show it because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire itself
will test the quality of each man's work. If any man's work which he has built
on it remains, he will receive a reward. If any man's work is burned up, he
will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.” (1
Corinthians 3:12-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Prominence is not the basis of reward, faithfulness is.
Matt. 25:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful
slave. You were faithful with a few things, I will put you in charge of many
things; enter into the joy of your master.'” (Matthew 25:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 19:30, “But many who are first” refers to many
of the first believers into the Church Age, will be last in rewards. It is
possible for many Christians living today to have more rewards than the first
century disciples. “The last” could mean that Christians alive today, perhaps,
will be first in rewards. In other words, where you come into the picture time
wise does not determine your reward. People think the first century was the
greatest century. Not necessarily.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But many who are first will be last; and the last,
first.” (Matthew 19:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Parable of the Laborers in the Vineyard</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Matthew 20 contrasts the legalistic believer and the
grace believer. The legalistic believer hustles all day and gets paid a denarius.
The believer who comes on the scene at the last hour leaves the wages up to the
discretion of the landowner and gets exactly the same wage. It is a believer
operating on grace. Those who labor an hour on the basis of grace are rewarded
as much as the hustler working on the basis of legalism.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Remember that the apostles, prophets, healers with
powerful and spectacular temporary spiritual gifts, are not necessarily going
to bring big rewards. The first century was loaded with legalism. This is
unique in that at the beginning of the Millennium they will judge with the 12
tribes; a reward, but some of those disciples are not going to get the rewards
that you can get right now.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Hiring of Laborers</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>First group arrived at 6:00 a.m. They agreed to a special
contract. They did not allow their wages to be decided by the integrity of the
vineyard owner. The contract was one denarius for a day’s wages per head. Today,
for a general farm laborer for 10 hours, that would be about $140. In
bargaining, they get into legalism. They pinned down the landowner to pay them
on the basis of what they deserved - the going wage rate at that time. This represents
legalism in the spiritual life. Matt. 20:1-7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“ “For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out
early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard. “When he had agreed
with the laborers for a denarius for the day, he sent them into his vineyard. “And
he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the market
place; and to those he said, ‘You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is
right I will give you.’ And so they went. “Again he went out about the sixth
and the ninth hour, and did the same thing. “And about the eleventh hour he
went out and found others standing around; and he said to them, ‘Why have you
been standing here idle all day long?’ “They said to him, ‘Because no one hired
us.’ He said to them, ‘You go into the vineyard too.’ “  (Matthew 20:1-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>By application, they should have been walking in
fellowship and working as unto the Lord and depending upon His perfect essence.
Those late in the Church Age will be first in rewards. The Lord will keep a
firm contract and it illustrates blessing under the Mosaic Law, but missing the
blessing of grace. The Mosaic Law emphasized reward only for work done and then
God will bless. Legalism hinders reward. Legalism hinders spiritual production
of divine good.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The second group started work at 9:00 a.m. They were “standing
idle.” They came too late to work with the first group, so waited for several
hours. They had no contract and left their compensation up the vineyard owner -
“whatsoever is right I will give you” in Matthew 20:4. This represents grace,
no bargaining with the vineyard owner. They depended upon the character of the
vineyard owner.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The third and fourth groups started work at the sixth and
ninth hour. These were grace situations. The vineyard owner would pay them what
he wished. The fifth group started work at the 11th hour or 5:00 p.m. These
last three groups of workers will receive exactly the same wages as the people
who worked hard from 6:00 a.m. in the morning. This is a true grace
illustration. What you receive as rewards will be determined by our Lord at the
Judgment Seat of Christ. It will all be based on His unfailing love and grace.
It will be based on who and what He is. We must leave the matter in His hands.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Being a charter member on the Day of Pentecost doesn’t
give those believers an advantage over believers living today. There were 120
charter members. It is quality, not quantity that is the basis of reward. Those
who worked from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. worked 12 hours on the basis of
legalism. Those who were the 11th hour workers operated for one hour on the
filling of the Holy Spirit. Reward is based on the understanding and utilizing
of grace, rather than one’s own efforts.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The 6:00 a.m. workers did not get more reward than those
who came at 5:00 p.m. They complained about it, but they didn’t get any more.
Why? Because of the principle of grace. Grace does not depend upon the function
of human norms and standards and abilities. Grace depends upon the character of
God. Grace is God doing the doing and man receiving the benefit. God gets the
credit.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Payment of Reward</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At 6:00 p.m., the landowner paid the last group of
workers who arrived at 5:00 p.m. The first group of workers saw this, but could
not recognize the grace principle. They grumbled when confronted with grace.
They thought it was completely unfair. This parable was to illustrate and teach
the disciples who have been fighting over who would be the greatest and who would
receive the greatest rewards. The first of them will be last, but the last
(Paul or later believers) will be first. Matt. 20:8-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“ “When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his
foreman, ‘Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last
group to the first.’ “When those hired about the eleventh hour came, each one
received a denarius. “When those hired first came, they thought that they would
receive more; but each of them also received a denarius. “When they received
it, they grumbled at the landowner, “  (Matthew 20:8-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Purpose of the parable is an indictment of legalism. Our
Lord’s disciples had been arguing as to who would be the greatest. God provides
the spiritual capital and only God provides the reward. God in His Sovereignty
determines the rewards for believers in grace because He is absolutely perfect.
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The ones who were hired later did not bargain for their
wages. Sometimes tithers are bargainers. Sometimes people dedicate their lives
for bargains. They say, “Now look, God, I’ll come to prayer meeting for a year
if you’ll do this.” They try to bargain with God! The point is that legalism
eliminates grace.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Reaction of the Legalistic Crowd</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 20:11-12, the legalists (the 5:00 a.m. group) always
think they are getting a raunchy deal. They agreed to work for a denarius, and
the landowner (by application, the Lord) was fair because he gave them what he
agreed to, what they had bargained for per the agreed contract. Their complaint
was they assumed all had bargained for the same wages. When the landowner
revealed that he had given the later groups of workers a more generous wage
based on his character, they felt that was unfair. The later groups all trusted
in the fairness of the landowner and would accept whatever wage he felt was
fair. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;When they received it, they grumbled at the landowner,
saying, 'These last men have worked only one hour, and you have made them equal
to us who have borne the burden and the scorching heat of the day.'” (Matthew
20:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This parable demonstrates God's grace principle and that
rewards will only be based on the perfect character of God. It also
demonstrates the mental attitude of the legalist. Don’t go on legalism, ever! “The
first shall be last.” The first in the field will be last in rewards; the last
in the field will be first in rewards. The first is a legalist and the last a
grace person.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Justice of the Householder</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 20:13, the word “Friend” actually means “partner.”
The vineyard owner gave what wage he wished. God gives to us what He wishes. We
cannot earn grace and we will never deserve God’s grace! No one ever gets ahead
on a legalistic basis. No one gets ahead because he deserves it. The believer
only gets ahead in the spiritual life on a grace basis. Grace is to God's credit
and based on His perfect character.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But he answered and said to one of them, 'Friend, I am
doing you no wrong; did you not agree with me for a denarius?” (Matthew 20:13,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is a major breakthrough when you understand grace and
you relax and join the human race. You’ve probably known for a long time that
no one else is any good, but then, neither are you! As you grow spiritually, you
begin to relax. You begin to be used by the Lord. It isn’t who and what you are
that counts. It is who and what the Lord is.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 20:14, the vineyard owner tells the workers to
“pick up your wages” and go. They were so mad that they actually threw their
money down on the ground. “Take what is yours and go.” This is the Lord’s
attitude toward legalism. </p>

<p class=Verses>“'Take what is yours and go, but I wish to give to this last
man the same as to you.” (Matthew 20:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are in union with Jesus Christ. We are His. Everything
belongs to Him! The legalist thinks God is unfair. The legalistic believer has
a legalistic and grudging eye. The householder has a gracious and a generous
eye. The legalistic workers are trying to reduce the gracious householder to
their level. The householder’s good was divine good. The legalist produced
human good. Don’t ever judge what the Lord provides by human norms and
standards!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Conclusion of the Parable</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The last into the field will be first in rewards. The
first into the field will be last in rewards. Many shall be called (salvation),
but few are chosen for rewards. Rewards depend upon the sovereign grace of God.
No one earns them. No one deserves them. The first ones into the field are
legalistic and complaining about their reward. The first ones into the field
are critical of grace, which is the only thing they cannot afford to criticize.
Matt. 20:15-16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“'Is it not lawful for me to do what I wish with what is my
own? Or is your eye envious because I am generous?' &quot;So the last shall be
first, and the first last.&quot;” (Matthew 20:15-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The grace of God does not produce an envious attitude.
While many are saved by grace, few continue to live by grace. Rewards are given
on the basis of living the Christian way of life according to the Word of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Jericho Discourse</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>A Salvation Prophecy</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 20:17-19, the Lord said, He was going to die
and they said, “What do you mean, Lord; that you’re going to die?” “The Son of
Man” is going to die (His humanity). The Son of Man is a title of the humanity
of Jesus Christ. God cannot die. The humanity of Jesus Christ was going to die.
He will be betrayed by Judas. Religious people will condemn him to death. He
will be delivered to the Gentiles - Pilate, Herod, and the Romans. He will be
handed over to the mockers, the whippers, the crucifiers.</p>

<p class=Verses>“As Jesus was about to go up to Jerusalem, He took the twelve
disciples aside by themselves, and on the way He said to them, “Behold, we are
going up to Jerusalem; and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief
priests and scribes, and they will condemn Him to death, and will hand Him over
to the Gentiles to mock and scourge and crucify Him, and on the third day He
will be raised up.” “  (Matthew 20:17-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>On the third day, Gentile time, He will be raised up. “He
will be raised up” is the future passive indicative of <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span
lang=EL>γει</span>́<span lang=EL>ρω</span> (egeirō). This is a logical future
tense and means that it is logical if He died and God approves, He will rise
again. Resurrection is the crowning touch in the whole grace operation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Ambitious Mother (Salome)</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>James and John wanted to sit in the place of prominence, they
wanted the highest rewards (first into the field). God help you if you have an
ambitious mother like Salome. Salome went to the Lord and tried to make a deal,
to make a firm contract that her two sons would sit on the right and on the
left in the kingdom (the highest places). Matt. 20:20-21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to Jesus with her
sons, bowing down and making a request of Him. And He said to her, “What do you
wish?” She said to Him, “Command that in Your kingdom these two sons of mine
may sit one on Your right and one on Your left.”“  (Matthew 20:20-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>First of all, Salome hadn’t been listening to Bible
doctrine and was apparently thinking about something else. She didn’t get it at
all and ignored the parable of the householder. Secondly, she failed to realize
that reward is based on God's grace, not on legalism. Thirdly, since entrance
into salvation is only by grace, it follows that everything in the Christian
way of life will only be by grace. Salome fell into Peter’s pattern, bypassing
the Cross for the crown. Matt. 16:21-23; Matt. 17. </p>

<p class=Verses>“From that time Jesus began to show His disciples that He must
go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and
scribes, and be killed, and be raised up on the third day. Peter took Him aside
and began to rebuke Him, saying, “God forbid it, Lord! This shall never happen
to You.” But He turned and said to Peter, “Get behind Me, Satan! You are a
stumbling block to Me; for you are not setting your mind on God’s interests,
but man’s.” “  (Matthew 16:21-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 20:20, “bowing down and making a request of
Him” means that Salome was a very thoughtful mother and put the interests of
her sons as a priority. First place for both sons was all she wanted. Salome
falls into the category of the ambitious mother. As many mothers will think,
her boys are the best boys! However, Salome did not know what she was asking.
She was actually putting her boys down at the end of the line! She was ignorant
of Bible doctrine!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ambition for children on the part of parents can often
ruin the children. It is worse than spoiling your children. Examples of this
are fathers who want their sons to follow them in their vocation and mothers
who fear that their daughters aren’t going to get married and will become old
maids, so they push them out to date too early and furnishing them with the
most modern contraceptives. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Reply of Jesus</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>How can someone like this fall into this pattern? Through
ignorance of Bible doctrine. People off on some segment of false teaching do
this like those in the tongues movement, faith healers and false teachers.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 20:22, Salome kept on asking. She had been
thinking this over and mulling it over in her mind and had asked Him several
times now. She wanted to be cast into the role of the grand dame. This is the
mother image personified to the extreme, to live in the shadow of the greatness
of her children.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But Jesus answered, “You do not know what you are asking. Are
you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?” They said to Him, “We are
able.”“  (Matthew 20:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 20:22, “the cup” stands for the sins of the
entire world. Christ drinks the cup meaning that all of the sins of mankind are
judged. The number one person in the Kingdom is the One who drinks the cup. Who
drinks the cup? The Lord Jesus Christ. The Lord had a wonderful sense of humor.
What He is asking them is whether they are able to go to the Cross and die for
the sins of the world. Obviously, they cannot. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>On the Cross, sin was judged and human good was rejected.
Human good will be judged later at the Judgment Seat of Christ for Church Age believers
and at the Great White Throne for all unbelievers. The Baptism of the Cup is
Jesus Christ being identified with sin on the Cross. The two disciples say to
Jesus Christ that they are able to take the cup. John is saying, “Why sure.”
They didn’t understand the Cross. All can appropriate this grace, but only one
can go to the Cross. Legalism always says, participate, get in the program,
work, work, work, but you can’t work for rewards! They are given on the basis
of grace. Man cannot participate in the work of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Sovereignty of the Father in the Distribution of Rewards</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 20:23, “My cup you shall drink” means they
will die, but not in the sense that they thought. They would die spiritually on
the Cross when Christ died. Not participation, but appropriation where drinking
becomes an illustration of faith. God has all the facts and will give out the
rewards. These rewards have already been prepared in the past and will stand
forever.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He said to them, “My cup you shall drink; but to sit on My
right and on My left, this is not Mine to give, but it is for those for whom it
has been prepared by My Father.” “  (Matthew 20:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Reaction of the Ten Disciples</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 20:24, we have the reaction of the ten
disciples. They got hot under their robes. They were extremely indignant. It
was all the mother’s fault, but the two sons get the heat of reaction by the
disciples. As a result of their mother getting into the picture, there were two
big arguments. The two sons versus the ten other disciples and the ten disciples
versus the two sons. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And hearing this, the ten became indignant with the two
brothers.”  (Matthew 20:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 20:25-28, our Lord contrasted His spiritual
kingdom to come with the Roman Empire at that time.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But Jesus called them to Himself and said, “You know that the
rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise
authority over them. “It is not this way among you, but whoever wishes to
become great among you shall be your servant, and whoever wishes to be first
among you shall be your slave; just as the Son of Man did not come to be
served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.” “  (Matthew
20:25-28, NASB)</p>
