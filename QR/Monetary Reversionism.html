<h2>Monetary Reversionism</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Most of us want to be happy in life. Whether we are
selfish about it or noble about it, we want to be happy. God wants us to be
happy too. But to truly be happy<span dir=RTL></span><span lang=HE dir=RTL><span
dir=RTL></span>,</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>we must go God’s way<span dir=RTL></span><span lang=HE dir=RTL><span
dir=RTL></span>.</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>God wants to give it all to us, but only on the basis of His grace.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The whole principle of James 1 is to ask yourself which
road are you on, the road to spiritual maturity or the reversionism road. When
you try to make yourself happy, you make yourself miserable. You might think of
yourself as a very nice person and respectable. You may feel that you will make
your own happiness apart from God. If you do, this is reversionism.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer made a bad decision in James 4:13-17 and
resulted in monetary reversionism. James 5:1-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go to such
and such a city, and spend a year there and engage in business and make a
profit.” Yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow. You are just
a vapor that appears for a little while and then vanishes away. Instead, you
ought to say, “If the Lord wills, we will live and also do this or that.” But
as it is, you boast in your arrogance; all such boasting is evil. Therefore, to
one who knows the right thing to do and does not do it, to him it is sin.” 
(James 4:13-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In James 5:1, “Come now” is the present active imperative
of <span lang=EL>α</span>̓́<span lang=EL>γε</span> (age) plus the temporal
adverb <span lang=EL>νυ</span>͂<span lang=EL>ν</span> (nun) and is an idiom.
There is nothing wrong with being rich. I’ve heard of no rich person becoming
poor to be happy, but it will come, the welfare state will bring it. Most feel
that if you have riches, you’ll be happy.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Come now, you rich, weep and howl for your miseries which are
coming upon you.”  (James 5:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>People always associate money with happiness. Of course
you can be wealthy and happy. Rare are the wealthy who can stay with the spiritual
life in spiritual maturity and enjoy the money that God has provided. The rich
believer in reversionism tells God that they will stay with Bible doctrine, but
they never seem to be able to find the time for daily Bible study.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Weep and howl” is <span lang=EL>κλαι</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (klaiō) plus <span lang=EL>ο</span>̓<span lang=EL>λολυ</span>́<span
lang=EL>ζω</span> (ololuzō) means to<span style='background:white'> mourn,
weep, and lament</span> and to cry out loud in a shriek or scream. The present
active participle means they are throwing a tantrum, total frustration, a
person who has everything but enjoys nothing. Their wealth is neutralized by
lack of capacity. The issue is not how much money you have, it is your
capacity!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You have made every effort to get Bible doctrine and you
may not have much money, but you must choose to learn how to gain capacity. Capacity
is the result of the daily function of the grace apparatus for perception.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What if you were given 10 million dollars tax-free? Would
you be Bible class tomorrow night? What if your prince charming came down the
aisle and he worked a swing shift that interfered with Bible class and to see
him, you had to miss Bible class. What would you decide? The spiritual life of
the maturing believer includes the capacity to enjoy what God provides. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“For your miseries” is <span lang=EL>ταλαιπωρι</span>́<span
lang=EL>α</span> (talaipōria) and means calamities or miseries. They have lots
of money (like Solomon) and can’t enjoy it. “Which are coming upon you” is the
present middle participle of <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>πε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ρχομαι</span> (eperchomai) which is a futuristic present and means this
is an event that has not yet occurred, but will occur. They continue in riches
with no capacity for life!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A literal translation of James 5:1 is, “Come on now you
rich ones, burst into weeping, continue screaming over your miseries that are
coming upon you.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You are either on the road to spiritual maturity or the
road to reversionism. Finding the opposite number for you is not all it’s
cracked up to be for the simple reason that without the capacity to respond and
the capacity to love gained from Bible doctrine in your soul, you will be more
miserable than before. It is possible for God to deliver a whole nation through
one man. Through prayer, Elijah ministered and the nation was delivered from
catastrophe and the fifth cycle of discipline.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In James 5:2, the phrase “Your riches” indicates the
wealth of the reversionist. There is nothing wrong with acquiring wealth. The
problem is the status of reversionism. The problem lies in lack of capacity. This
is wealth in the hands of those who have the ability to gain that wealth. This
wealth belongs to a believer. They made a decision to neglect Bible doctrine
and went positive to the idea of accumulating wealth.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Your riches have rotted and your garments have become
moth-eaten.”  (James 5:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Have rotted” is the perfect active indicative of <span
lang=EL>ση</span>́<span lang=EL>πω</span> (sēpō) and means to become corrupt,
corrupted, rotten. It is not the money that rots, it’s the soul with no
capacity that rots, “your riches have rotted.” Whenever a believer enters into
reversionism, their soul deteriorates and Bible doctrine contained in it is corrupted
or rotted. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The stages of corruption of the soul includes scar
tissue, the creation of a soul vacuum that pulls in false doctrine, blackout of
the soul, emotional revolt of the soul, followed by reverse process
reversionism. The indicative mood means the reality of the rotting of the soul
while the wealth was being accumulated. Reversionism has no capacity for wealth
or prosperity of any kind. No prosperity of love, social life, job or
profession, influence, affluence, marriage, or family. A believer can never
enjoy these things without the kiss of grace, and the propelling of grace to
spiritual maturity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Many of you can’t enjoy anything. You don’t even have the
capacity for a good automobile. Neither does the government. The government is
in reversionism as they deviate from the laws of divine establishment and the
rule of law. Either you are for Bible doctrine or you are against it.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The wealth or possessions of a person are no greater than
the soul of that person and no greater than the capacity of that person. When
money becomes the object of pseudo love fanaticism, the soul rots. When a man
or woman becomes the object of pseudo love fanaticism, the soul rots. A rotten
reversionistic soul can recover by using 1 John 1:9 and confessing their sins
to God the Father. If not, ultimately the sin unto death awaits. </p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is no excuse for having a rotten soul. Bible
doctrine is available. “Rotten soul” is a synonym for reversionism. Anything
you prefer over doctrine is inconsequential! This applies even to legitimate
desires if they detract from or take priority over Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some of you males, when you fall in love with a woman and
knock out Bible doctrine, you make that woman a nothing even though she really
is something. Why? You have a rotten soul. You have put your interest in her
ahead of Bible doctrine. When you turn your back on Bible doctrine, the fun is
over! You say “There is something on TV; I’m going to see it.” You say “There
is a party. I’m going to it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Football games on TV or at the local field are
legitimate, but doctrine must be your priority. You can’t enjoy football
without danger to your soul until you have developed spiritual capacity for
football through daily intake of doctrine. The same is true of baseball or
other sports. Money isn’t the big thing with many of you, but it is what means
a lot to you, what you consider necessary for happiness, for relaxation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The capital for redeeming time is Bible doctrine. This is
divine capital. Then God will give pleasure. Pursue doctrine and money will run
after you. Pursue Bible doctrine and you will be able to spiritually discern
whether a woman you have met is the one for you. Pursue doctrine and you will
recognize the man for you when you meet him. He will run after you. “Have
become moth-eaten” is the perfect active indicative of <span lang=EL>γι</span>́<span
lang=EL>νομαι</span> (ginomai) plus <span lang=EL>σητο</span>́<span lang=EL>βρωτος</span>
(sētobrōtos) means in the process of becoming moth eaten. It is ruinous to
compliment a moth-eaten soul.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In James 5:3, “Your gold and your silver have rusted” is
the perfect passive indicative of <span lang=EL>κατιο</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(katioō) and means your valued possessions have rusted, tarnished, corroded.
This is a consummative perfect meaning the soul is also being tarnished. Gold
provides wealth, but doctrine provides capacity for wealth.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Your gold and your silver have rusted; and their rust will be
a witness against you and will consume your flesh like fire. It is in the last
days that you have stored up your treasure!”  (James 5:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“And their rust” does not mean rust, but poison or venom.
“And their rust (venom of the soul) will be” is the future active indicative of
<span lang=EL>ει</span>̓<span lang=EL>μι</span>́ (eimi). This is a gnomic
future tense and is used as a statement of fact, which can be expected under
conditions of reversionism. We started with rot of the soul. We now have venom
of the soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Will be a witness against you” means that in
reversionism, the believer gathers their own evidence which leads to their
prosecution and divine discipline - illness and ultimately, the sin unto death.
Venom in the soul today means divine discipline in your life tomorrow. This is
the frantic search for happiness. “And will consume your flesh like fire”
refers to the objects of prosperity such as money, husband, wife, power,
success, and influence.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“In the last days” refers to your retirement which will
be a total catastrophe. The crisis catastrophe or the crisis days. Turn to
money, but it won’t help you. Turn to a woman and she can’t help you. The only
one who can help you is the pastor-teacher teaching Bible doctrine from which
you have turned away.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Stored” is the aorist active indicative of <span
lang=EL>θησαυρι</span>́<span lang=EL>ζω</span> (thēsaurizō) and means to
accumulate treasure. When you personally seek prosperity, you produce a
reaction in your soul, that is, a fire which destroys the soul. It is as if you
saved a fire in order to burn yourself up. This is the reality of the
reversionist trying to solve their problems by use of the object which they
have been seeking. Problems are not solved with money or success, but with
Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Your pastor-teacher’s life is strictly between him and
God. His message or content of Bible doctrine is based on his study. His
authority is based on his spiritual gift given to him by the Holy Spirit at
salvation. You must agree with God that your pastor-teacher has authority
because of his spiritual gift. In reversionism, the message is rejected, the
authority is disregarded, and the life of the pastor-teacher is maligned. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Areas of Monetary Reversionism</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Three major areas of monetary reversionism are distortions
of business life, social life, and the laws and justice of divine establishment.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Distortions of Business Life</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In James 5:4, “Behold” is <span lang=EL>ι</span>̓<span
lang=EL>δου</span>́ (idou) in the Greek and is actually a particle taken from
the aorist middle imperative of the verb <span lang=EL>ο</span>̔<span lang=EL>ρα</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (horaō) which means to see, to look, to behold. A
demonstrative particle is designed to focus attention - now see here, hear
this, observe this. “The pay of the laborers” is <span lang=EL>μισθο</span>́<span
lang=EL>ς</span> (misthos) and means wages. He cheated his employees and thus
he was able to make money. When God provides money, there is no cheating
involved. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Behold, the pay of the laborers who mowed your fields, and
which has been withheld by you, cries out against you; and the outcry of those
who did the harvesting has reached the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.”  (James
5:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Who mowed” is the aorist active participle of <span
lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>μα</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (amaō) and
means to harvest. He hired men to cut and gather the wheat and then refused to
pay them their just due wages. “Your fields” refers to industry as it existed
in the ancient world. In the ancient world, they had an agricultural economy.
This was a man with a rotten soul having influence in business and the rotten
soul affects everyone else. He was a cheat.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Which has been withheld by you” is the perfect passive
participle of <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>φυστερε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (aphustereō) which means to defraud. He habitually defrauded
people of their wages. There is nothing worse than a man doing well under free
enterprise and yet he cheats those who have a legitimate right to a living. “Cries
out against you” is the present active indicative of <span lang=EL>κρα</span>́<span
lang=EL>ζω</span> (krazō) which means to scream. The victim is screaming. It
is the cry of desperation. Deut. 24:14-15. </p>

<p class=Verses>““You shall not oppress a hired servant who is poor and needy,
whether he is one of your countrymen or one of your aliens who is in your land
in your towns. “You shall give him his wages on his day before the sun sets,
for he is poor and sets his heart on it; so that he will not cry against you to
the LORD and it become sin in you.”  (Deuteronomy 24:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The laws of divine establishment are an extension of the
grace of God. The more money one makes under free enterprise, the greater
becomes their responsibility to the system under which they become wealthy. They
have a fantastic responsibility. They have a responsibility to continue to
create and to perpetuate business systems under free enterprise so there will
continue to be prosperity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In James 5:4, “the outcry of those who did the harvesting”
is the aorist active participle of <span lang=EL>βοη</span>́ (boē). The action
of the aorist participle precedes the action of the main verb. They did their
job, they did legitimate work. The rich man broke his verbal contract to make
more money. The reversionist will lie, cheat, and steal.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Has reached” is the perfect active indicative of <span
lang=EL>ει</span>̓<span lang=EL>σε</span>́<span lang=EL>ρχομαι</span>
(eiserchomai) and means to enter into. They have entered in the past with the
result that God is going to do something about it. “The Lord of Sabaoth” means
the screams of the starving, homeless, and helpless have reached the Lord of Armies
because the promised wages were not paid.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They will suffer from violence or revolution as occurred
in Russia in 1917 with the Bolshevik Revolution. National revolution will
deprive them of their wealth and their freedom. In this catastrophe, the man
will lose everything, his wealth and more importantly, the freedom under which
he made his wealth.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Social Life</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Social life as with business life can contribute to the
destruction of a national entity. In James 5:5, “You have lived luxuriously” is
the aorist active indicative of <span lang=EL>τρυφα</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(truphaō) and means to live a life of luxury or self-indulgence, to push
luxury to the point of self-indulgence, to carouse, to revel. To have capacity
for abundance of one or more of the details of life is one thing and to indulge
one’s desire or lust for those details is another.</p>

<p class=Verses>“You have lived luxuriously on the earth and led a life of
wanton pleasure; you have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter.”  (James
5:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Wanton pleasure” is the aorist active indicative of <span
lang=EL>σπαταλα</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (spatalaō) and means one
addicted to sensual pleasures. This man said no to Bible doctrine, but yes to
sensual pleasure and luxurious living. “You have fattened your hearts in a day
of slaughter” is the aorist active indicative of <span lang=EL>τρε</span>́<span
lang=EL>φω</span> (trephō) and means to fatten a calf for slaughter. This ties
in with the Lord of Armies. National disaster and slaughter. You have fattened
your right lobes as did Job’s children. Empty of Bible doctrine, but full of
pleasures! No self-discipline!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When believers become reversionistic, they become
anti-establishment and they destroy the very thing that made them successful.
They cause a reaction, revolution, or curtailment upon free enterprise. Just as
it is one of the functions of government to protect the prosperity of its
citizens, it is also the responsibility of those who are prosperous under free
enterprise.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Since every believer is saved by grace, why then would they
turn and reject every principle that is given them in eternal salvation? Why do
we have legalists? Why are people so stupid? Having been saved by grace through
faith, then go suddenly and turn to a system of human works and human good. Why
do the people suddenly become do-gooders? Well, the same thing happens in
government.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The same thing happens under the laws of divine establishment.
Those who have profited the most under free enterprise, turn against free
enterprise and cheat out of a true profit those who work for them. As a result
of cheating them, they destroy true prosperity except for themselves. You can’t
isolate prosperity. When you seek to isolate prosperity by making more money at
the expense of those who work for you, inevitably you not only destroy their
prosperity first, but you destroy yours as well. The result is revolution which
destroys everyone’s prosperity. The very system that made this person
successful becomes a tyrant that destroys others.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If an employee becomes disabled on the job, the
manager-owner is to take care of him on the profits he has made in the
business, not the government!  Our government is trying to legislate
reversionism. Legislation is not the answer! </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Today, if you make money, you may have a guilt complex
about it because big business is hated today. Many are leaving this country
with their businesses because of this. Government contracts have strings
attached with a certain mix of employees, so many government inspectors, etc.
When big business goes into slavery to the government, everyone goes into
slavery to the government. Reversionists must have a breeding ground in the
midst of national prosperity. The people in this country are ready for slavery.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A literal translation of James 5:5 is, “You have lived in
luxury and self-indulgence in the land, you have led a life of wanton pleasure,
you have fattened your right lobes for a day of slaughter.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Laws and Justice of Divine Establishment</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Law suppresses the evil of the old sin nature and makes
possible the freedom for the individual citizen, their privacy, and the
property of the individual citizen. The criminal must be punished. Citizens
have the right to enter into business and have the right to own property. If they
try to destroy the law in the same way, they seek to destroy free enterprise.
How do they do it? They use their money to bribe. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In James 5:6, “You have condemned” is the aorist active
indicative from the compound verb <span lang=EL>καταδικα</span>́<span lang=EL>ζω</span>
(katadikazō) and means to pass sentence upon or condemn. He has used his
wealth, influence, and power to place an innocent person under condemnation. “And
put to death the righteous man” is the aorist active indicative of <span
lang=EL>δι</span>́<span lang=EL>καιος</span> (dikaios) and means guiltless or
innocent. The law should protect the innocent and condemn the guilty, not the
other way around! Reversionism distorts the law. The innocent are condemned to
die. </p>

<p class=Verses>“You have condemned and put to death the righteous man; he does
not resist you.”  (James 5:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“He does not resist you” is the present middle indicative
of <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>ντιτα</span>́<span lang=EL>σσομαι</span>
(antitassomai). This innocent person does not oppose you. He is not against you
and your money. This is the possession of money combined with approbation lust
plus the abuse of power. This is power lust.  He does not oppose you, so you
are saying in effect, you are opposing yourself.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Note the pattern so far in monetary reversionism – the
Lord of Armies hears resulting in military disaster in James 5:4. Then came the
day of slaughter or revolution disaster in James 5:5 followed by
self-destruction in James 5:6. Reversionism destroys yourself.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Solution to Monetary Reversionism</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>First, the believer goes negative to some point of Bible
doctrine. Negative volition toward Bible doctrine puts scar tissue on the soul.
Scar tissue opens up the vacuum of the soul and draws satanic and false
doctrine into the right lobe. This false doctrine attacks the frame of
reference in the memory center, the vocabulary, the conscience and the
launching pad.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the same time, the old sin nature opens up and the
frantic search for happiness functions through approbation, power, and money
lust, putting scar tissue on the right lobe of the soul. This monetary
reversionist cheats in business, in social life, and tries to destroy the
establishment. The resulting emotional revolt of the soul leads to blackout of
the soul and reverse process reversionism.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Doctrine should be the object of the individual’s love, but
instead they put money before doctrine, and therefore destroy their capacity to
enjoy money. There is nothing wrong with money, but there is everything wrong
with having no capacity for money.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In James 5:7, “be patient” is the aorist active
imperative of the Greek verb <span lang=EL>μακροθυμε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(makrothumeō) and means long souled, long minded, long-suffering, to be
patient. It means to push for doctrine rather than money. Patience is the
spiritual capital instead of money in the spiritual life. This means there is a
conclusion that you do not have to be disciplined by God or even die the sin
unto death. You can get out of reversionism. The constantive aorist tense looks
at the total amount of doctrine in a believer’s heart. The active voice means
the believer is “spending” the doctrine or applying it to life’s situations.
The imperative mood means this is a command to use doctrine as capital. Go for
doctrine instead. If you go for doctrine, money pursues you. If you apply the
discernment of Bible doctrine and look for soul qualities that the Word of God
presents, the man for you will pursue you, or you will find the woman for you.
You will succeed.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore be patient, brethren, until the coming of the Lord.
The farmer waits for the precious produce of the soil, being patient about it,
until it gets the early and late rains.”  (James 5:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Here is the spiritually mature believer using their
capital. The capital for salvation is the Blood of Jesus Christ, God’s Son, who
cleansed us all from sin. Bible doctrine in the soul is equivalent to money in
the bank. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual maturity gives you capacity for freedom, life,
love, happiness, grace, and prosperity. Spiritual maturity gives you the
ability to handle any disaster, difficulty, or tragedy of life. The capacity
bracket in the spiritual life includes the frame of reference, memory center,
vocabulary, categories, conscience, and launching pad.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In James 5:7, “brethren” refers to members of the family
of God in reversionism. The love of money (monetary reversionism) is the root
of all kinds of evil, whereas the love of Bible doctrine is the root of all
divine good. Problems are solved by doctrine in the soul, not by money. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Until the coming of the Lord” refers to the Rapture of
the Church. It is imperative in the Church Age that all believers become
capitalists. Stay with it until you get doctrinally grounded just as a farmer
stays with it until they get capital from the harvest.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“The farmer waits” is the present middle indicative of <span
lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>κδε</span>́<span lang=EL>χομαι</span>
(ekdechomai) and means to receive from another, to expect to receive something.
The reference to a farmer refers to an agricultural type of economy and is the
same as a capitalist in today’s economy who invested their money. It means to
look for something with expectation. If you invested $50,000 in some oil lease,
you would expect a return, a profit. This is strictly the concept of
capitalism.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The farmer waits with expectation. The present tense is
an iterative present or that which occurs, or reoccurs at successive intervals
in an agriculture economy such as sowing, harvest, and taking profit. The
middle voice means the subject participates in the results of the action of the
verb. The indirect middle is used here in which the agent producing the action
is emphasized. Here we have the farmer making money and benefiting from it. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Only the spiritually mature believer with a saturation of
doctrine in their soul has the capacity to enjoy life. Bible doctrine in the
soul makes the difference. The indicative mood refers to the reality of the spiritually
mature believer utilizing Bible doctrine in the soul. The reality of spending
doctrine to the Lord’s profit.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In James 5:7, “precious” is <span lang=EL>τι</span>́<span
lang=EL>μιος</span> (timios) and means the highest value. “Produce” is <span
lang=EL>καρπο</span>́<span lang=EL>ς</span> (karpos) and means production of
the earth. This is the spiritually mature believer producing maximum divine
good, redeeming the time while waiting for the Rapture of the Church or
eternity face-to-face with the Lord. This also refers to capital gains from
doctrine spent in the mature stages of the spiritual life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Being patient” is the present active participle of the
verb <span lang=EL>μακροθυμε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (makrothumeō). It
is technical for getting Bible doctrine in the soul and spending it. The soul
invests in spiritual capital, Bible doctrine. “Until it gets” is the aorist
active subjunctive of <span lang=EL>λαμβα</span>́<span lang=EL>νω</span>
(lambanō). The culminative aorist means he has now received the profit. The
active voice means he has made his profit. The subjunctive mood refers to the
potentiality of the factors that go into success in the business of
agriculture.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“The early rains” refers to the seasonal rains received
from October to December in Palestine. Rain portrays God’s grace. The early
rain refers to the immature believer taking in Bible doctrine daily all the way
to spiritual maturity. The “late rains” refers to the seasonal rains that come
in March and April and are analogous to the spiritually mature believer with
prosperity that includes capacity for life, freedom, love, happiness,
prosperity, and grace. Heb. 6:7-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For ground that drinks the rain which often falls on it and
brings forth vegetation useful to those for whose sake it is also tilled,
receives a blessing from God; but if it yields thorns and thistles, it is
worthless and close to being cursed, and it ends up being burned. But, beloved,
we are convinced of better things concerning you, and things that accompany
salvation, though we are speaking in this way. For God is not unjust so as to
forget your work and the love which you have shown toward His name, in having
ministered and in still ministering to the saints.”  (Hebrews 6:7-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A corrected translation of James 5:7 is, “Have patience,
therefore, members of the family of God until the coming of the Lord or the
Rapture. Behold, the capitalist farmer waits with expectation for the very
valuable production of the land, constantly being patient over the land until
he has received the early and latter rains.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Summary</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The command is given to the spiritually mature believer
to redeem the time by utilizing God's grace resources through the application
of Bible doctrine. This is capital for salvation through the Blood of Christ
and capital for the spiritual life through Bible doctrine in the soul. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The command is to continue as long as you live on this
earth, either until death or the Rapture moves you into the presence of the
Lord. The illustration is used from capitalism of an agricultural economy. The
farmer illustrates the spiritually mature believer redeeming the time through
doctrine. The early rain refers to the approach to spiritual maturity where the
believer responds to the nurturing of God’s grace and His Word.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The farming analogy involves planting of the seed,
germination of the seed, the plant’s growth, and the subsequent harvest. The
latter rain is the maturing of the grain prior to harvest. This is the entrance
to spiritual maturity. The function of the spiritually mature believer demands
total capacity for maximum doctrine in the soul. This is capacity for freedom,
capacity for life, capacity for love, capacity for God’s happiness, and sharing
the happiness of God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>No believer ever goes from spiritual infancy to spiritual
maturity without their right pastor-teacher communicating in a local church in
which there is strict academic discipline. This requires the filling of the
Holy Spirit and the daily function of the grace apparatus for perception. This
requires the persistence in the intake of Bible doctrine. Don’t start and quit
and start and quit.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Only a pastor-teacher can lead his sheep to spiritual
maturity! Only a pastor-teacher who knows the original languages can mature a
congregation. Pastor-teachers can often do other things, but congregations who
desire growth cannot. The local church is the feeding trough and you have to
come and get it. A student of the word under a pastor-teacher is an individual
without portfolio.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In James 5:8, “You too be patient” is the aorist active
imperative of <span lang=EL>μακροθυμε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(makrothumeō). This is the same verb and the same morphology. Again it refers
to the grace apparatus for perception. You stay with it. Your stay with the
intake of Bible doctrine. Doctrine in the left lobe of the soul as <i>gnosis</i>
and cannot be applied as in James 1. Bible doctrine must be believed and
resident in the right lobe as <i>epignosis</i> to be applied to life’s
situations.</p>

<p class=Verses>“You too be patient; strengthen your hearts, for the coming of
the Lord is near.”  (James 5:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Strengthen your hearts” is the aorist active imperative
of <span lang=EL>στηρι</span>́<span lang=EL>ζω</span> (stērizō) and means to
have stability. Doctrine gives you stability in the right lobe of your soul
(heart). “<span lang=EL>Ι</span>s near” is <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span
lang=EL>γγι</span>́<span lang=EL>ζω</span> (eggizō) and means it keeps on
getting closer all the time. The Rapture is imminent. 1 Cor. 1:7; 1 Thess. 5:6;
Titus 2:13; James 5:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“so that you are not lacking in any gift, awaiting eagerly the
revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ,”  (1 Corinthians 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“so then let us not sleep as others do, but let us be alert and
sober.”  (1 Thessalonians 5:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of
our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus,”  (Titus 2:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“You too be patient; strengthen your hearts, for the coming of
the Lord is near.”  (James 5:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is no prophecy to be fulfilled for the Rapture to
occur. The restatement of the command is to remind the believer that every day
is a day in which they can purchase time for the Lord. You are going to run out
of days because the Rapture or death is going to occur. So while you have a
day, and while you have money (capital), buy it! You purchase time by
maximizing the time you are filled with the Holy Spirit and taking in the Word
of God. Buy time while you have time. Eph. 5:16-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“making the most of your time, because the days are evil. So
then do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is. And do not
get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit,” 
(Ephesians 5:16-18, NASB)</p>
