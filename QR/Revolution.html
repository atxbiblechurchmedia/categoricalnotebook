<h2>Revolution</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Revolution is a violent overthrow of a bona fide
government power. When human power and privilege are monopolized by a few,
people become oppressed. When freedom is limited, opportunity is limited. They
may even be in slavery. People and resources cannot be exploited apart from
freedom without reaction which is often violent. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>But revolution, the attempt to overthrow, does not
achieve anything worthwhile. Anything achieved by revolution, which seems to be
bona fide, could have been achieved without revolution. The end does not
justify the means. Neither the Word of God nor human history justify revolution.
Rom.13:1-7; 1 Peter 2:13-14. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Every person is to be in subjection to the governing
authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist
are established by God. Therefore whoever resists authority has opposed the
ordinance of God; and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon
themselves. For rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior, but for evil.
Do you want to have no fear of authority? Do what is good and you will have
praise from the same; for it is a minister of God to you for good. But if you
do what is evil, be afraid; for it does not bear the sword for nothing; for it
is a minister of God, an avenger who brings wrath on the one who practices
evil. Therefore it is necessary to be in subjection, not only because of wrath,
but also for conscience' sake. For because of this you also pay taxes, for
rulers are servants of God, devoting themselves to this very thing. Render to
all what is due them: tax to whom tax is due; custom to whom custom; fear to
whom fear; honor to whom honor.” (Romans 13:1-7, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every human
institution, whether to a king as the one in authority, or to governors as sent
by him for the punishment of evildoers and the praise of those who do right.”
(1 Peter 2:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An illustration of this is the Dathan and Abiram incident
in Numbers l6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now Korah the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of
Levi, with Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On the son of Peleth, sons
of Reuben, took action, and they rose up before Moses, together with some of
the sons of Israel, two hundred and fifty leaders of the congregation, chosen
in the assembly, men of renown. They assembled together against Moses and
Aaron, and said to them, “You have gone far enough, for all the congregation
are holy, every one of them, and the LORD is in their midst; so why do you
exalt yourselves above the assembly of the LORD?”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Numbers 16:1-3,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Moses sent a summons to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of
Eliab; but they said, “We will not come up. “Is it not enough that you have
brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to have us die in the
wilderness, but you would also lord it over us?”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Numbers 16:12-13,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, “Speak to the
congregation, saying, ‘Get back from around the dwellings of Korah, Dathan and
Abiram.’“ Then Moses arose and went to Dathan and Abiram, with the elders of
Israel following him, and he spoke to the congregation, saying, “Depart now
from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing that belongs to them, or
you will be swept away in all their sin.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Numbers 16:23-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““But if the LORD brings about an entirely new thing and the
ground opens its mouth and swallows them up with all that is theirs, and they
descend alive into Sheol, then you will understand that these men have spurned
the LORD.” As he finished speaking all these words, the ground that was under
them split open; and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, and
their households, and all the men who belonged to Korah with their possessions.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Numbers
16:30-32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Rebellious thinking (negative volition) against the
Divine Institutions are linked with revolution. Isaiah 1:3-5; Heb. 3:11-15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;An ox knows its owner, And a donkey its master's manger,
But Israel does not know, My people do not understand.&quot; Alas, sinful
nation, People weighed down with iniquity, Offspring of evildoers, Sons who act
corruptly! They have abandoned the LORD, They have despised the Holy One of
Israel, They have turned away from Him. Where will you be stricken again, As
you continue in your rebellion? The whole head is sick And the whole heart is
faint.” (Isaiah 1:3-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“AS I SWORE IN MY WRATH, 'THEY SHALL NOT ENTER MY REST.'&quot;
Take care, brethren, that there not be in any one of you an evil, unbelieving
heart that falls away from the living God. But encourage one another day after
day, as long as it is still called &quot;Today,&quot; so that none of you will
be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. For we have become partakers of
Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our assurance firm until the end,
while it is said, &quot;TODAY IF YOU HEAR HIS VOICE, DO NOT HARDEN YOUR HEARTS,
AS WHEN THEY PROVOKED ME.&quot;” (Hebrews 3:11-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Revolution is based on jealousy. Isaiah 11:13; 1 Kings
12:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the jealousy of Ephraim will depart, And those who harass
Judah will be cut off; Ephraim will not be jealous of Judah, And Judah will not
harass Ephraim.” (Isaiah 11:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to
this day.” (1 Kings 12:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The American Revolutionary War was not a revolution, but
a struggle for freedom. It should have been called a civil war rather than a
revolution. Colonies were being taxed without any representation in England’s
government (Parliament). Every attempt was made by the Colonies to settle the
problem by peaceful means. Finally they had to fight for their freedom. This
was tyranny. It was no revolution. It was a war for freedom. They were not
trying to overthrow the House of Commons. They felt that they should have a
voice in their government. This was a war for independence.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The French Revolution achieved reform through a violent
revolution. With the Reform Bill of 1812 in England, they accomplished reform
through parliamentary procedure. The end does not justify the means. A revolution
breaks sharply with the past and courts madness, this madness leads to national
trauma. Destruction of any form of government or order by revolution causes
anarchy. By analogy, as the sanity of an individual lies in the continuity of their
memories, so the sanity of a group lies in the perpetuation of Divine
Institution # 4 - Nationalism.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the French Revolution, they didn’t have any money, so
they printed more money. Did that solve anything? No. A revolution always takes
the leaves off the tree and it always runs down the country. Revolution also
leads to mobs without thought or sanity. They are neurotic in their reaction
and psychotic. Violence is the means which they use to seek to achieve their
ends, but this never achieves a permanent solution. Killing in defense of your
country is justified, but never is the violence of a mob justified. Killing
people because they have been successful in business and killing those whom you
don’t like is never justified.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Revolution destroys the economy of a nation. Nevertheless,
even though there is revolution and you are still alive, God still has a
purpose for you in this life. Daniel 4:14-15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“'He shouted out and spoke as follows: &quot;Chop down the tree
and cut off its branches, Strip off its foliage and scatter its fruit; Let the
beasts flee from under it And the birds from its branches. &quot;Yet leave the
stump with its roots in the ground, But with a band of iron and bronze around
it In the new grass of the field; And let him be drenched with the dew of
heaven, And let him share with the beasts in the grass of the earth.” (Daniel
4:14-15, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Even at the end of the Millennium, immediately upon his
release, Satan will sponsor revolution against the perfect environment and
government of our Lord Jesus Christ. Rev. 20:7-8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“When the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released
from his prison, and will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four
corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for the war; the
number of them is like the sand of the seashore.”  (Revelation 20:7-8, NASB)</p>
