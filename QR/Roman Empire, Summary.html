<h2><a name="_The_Roman_Empire,"></a>Roman Empire, Summary</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Roman Empire was the turning point of ancient and
modern history. All of the rivers of ancient civilizations flowed into the lake
of the Roman Empire and all the rivers of modern civilization flowed out of the
lake of the Roman Empire. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Rome began as a little village on the bank of the Tiber,
then became a city-state, then a nation, then a great world empire. Rome gave
the world a respect for law and administration. The Greeks were known for their
culture, the Persians for their science, and the Romans for their laws and codes.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Romans began to conquer in 264 BC. They conquered in
a dreadful manner. Over a million people died in the Punic Wars. From 264 to
146 BC, they conquered Carthage, Egypt, Macedonia, and Syria. They called
themselves SPQR, “The Senate and People of Rome.” In this period, many of the
rich were killed, leaving only the middle class and poor class.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 146 BC, the Knights, the Roman middle class, took over
and there was some stabilization. However, a mob of a million people, poor,
dangerous, and ragged, came out of the Punic wars and the tail began to wag the
dog.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Knights were capitalistic at first, but switched to a
dual socialistic-capitalistic system. It is the middle class always that keeps
a nation stabilized and operating under free enterprise and capitalism.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Later, the mob took over from the Knights. Who had to
sustain the mob? The middle class was forced to sustain the mob by socialism. As
long as the middle class were able to pay the bills and feed the mob, the
civilization survived. But the middle class reached a point where they were
unable to do so. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For example, their currency was destroyed by going off
the gold standard. How? When Alexander the Great defeated the Persians in 331
BC, he gained the treasury of Susa containing about 2 million pounds of gold
and silver ingots and a half million pounds in gold coins that were poured into
the world’s economy. But the Romans traded this gold for peacock feathers and
other luxuries from China and India.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Then they issued paper money, which had no gold standard.
Finally the mobs and socialism destroyed Rome. It would have been destroyed
sooner, except Bible doctrine in the souls of believers became the great
stabilizing factor during the Antonine Caesars from 96 to 192 AD. The mobs
should never be catered to nor the lower classes as this destroys any country.</p>
