<h2>Refreshment</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The word “refreshment” in the English language usually
denotes food and beverage. The New Testament Greek word has a much greater
meaning. It means to restore the strength of the soul. It means to actually
revive the divine viewpoint of life in an individual and to do this apart from
the pastor's function of teaching the Word of God. This soul res­toration is
actually an individual believer providing blessing to the life of a fellow
believer without sitting them down and teaching them Bible doctrine. We are to
possess unconditional <i>agapao</i> love toward everyone and conditional,
personal <i>phileo</i> love toward our few loved ones and friends. As we
possess this type of caring, compassion, and consideration, we become a
stimulant, a bless­ing, and a source of refreshment to others as we continue in
our spiritual advance. The meaning of the biblical word for refreshment denotes
supplying what is necessary in spiritual blessing during a time of adversity
and disaster in the life of another individual.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Timothy 1:16, the Greek verb for “refresh” is <span
lang=EL>ἀναψύχω</span> (anapsuchō) and means to breathe again and again or
to revive the soul. Our lives as Christians should be a source of revival to
indiv­idual souls in our periphery. Our lives as spiritually maturing believers
can be and should be a source of blessing to others without getting into any
competition. This means to do so without feeling superior to them, without
putting others down, without becoming upset and fretting over people, and
without that terrible sarcasm which has become so natural and so characteristic
today.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he
often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains;&quot;  (2 Timothy 1:16,
NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We should possess a true and honorable friendship with
others, which is a relationship based on our strength of character. This is
what characterizes a sincere friendship relationship. We must remember that in
our own day and age, sin­cerity has been misused by those believers who equate
Christianity with ecstatics and are always involved in some reaction from
emotions controlling their souls. These charismatic Christians, as they call
themselves, have eliminated rationalism and common sense in favor of emotions
controlling the soul. When the believer is growing spiritually under the
influence of Bible truth, they should never overreact. In fact, the intake and
application of Bible truth stabilizes the soul and actually provides the basis
for communicating warmth, friendship, stability and encouragement to others. We
have the opportunity to utilize all these things under the ministry of
refreshment. As it concerns our friendship with fellow believers, refreshment
must always be a two-way street. This means that your true and sincere friends
are those who are positive to the intake and application of Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Ministry of Refreshment Through Music</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Music can be used in the ministry of refreshment. We must
rea­lize that there is nothing wrong with tapping our feet to some up-beat
rhythm or song. However, we should remember that the most important thing in
Christian music is not the melody or the rhythm, but the lyrics. The lyrics or
the words to the song should convey an accurate doctrinal message or testimony,
word of praise, or thanksgiving. Modern day sacred music is totally out of line
by presenting songs in the medium of heavy metal, hard rock, punk rock, and
other forms of rock and roll music that emphasize the music over the lyrics. Those
who emphasize a lot of body-swaying rhythm and music and neglect the words to
the songs are superficial or erroneous! When we are Spirit-filled and
ministering or being ministered to in song, we can experience a great sense of
refreshment, encouragement, and blessing.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Refreshment through music is seen in 1 Samuel 16:23 where
King Saul experienced a temporary allevia­tion of his psychotic condition
through the ministry of refreshment in music. Apparently, King Saul had a
psychotic condition which erupted from time to time when he was under any kind
of extreme pressure. Apparently, this condition was trig­gered by jealousy from
Saul's reversionistic state. It seems there was very little that could be done.
But we see that a spiritually mature teenager by the name of David came into
the life of Saul and was able to help. Whenever an evil spirit from God (this
is permissive control of history by Jesus Christ, permitting, demon influence
in the life of arrogant reversionistic Saul) came to Saul, David would take his
harp and play it and Saul would be refreshed. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So it came about whenever the evil spirit from God came
to Saul, David would take the harp and play it with his hand; and Saul would be
refreshed and be well, and the evil spirit would depart from him.&quot;  (1
Samuel 16:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Why did Saul became refreshed? It was the music David
played on the harp with the doctrinal lyrics which he sang. Whenever David sang
and played that music, it reached right into Saul's soul and brought his soul
back to reality and temporarily relieved the psychotic condition. In other
words, re­freshment came to Saul's soul and the refreshment alleviated the
suffering and caused him to calm down. Refreshment from doctrinal music, both
the melody and lyrics, can be used for soul recovery from an adverse condition
whether it's caused by being reversionistic, psychosis, or any influence of
Satan's world system of evil. This may apply when we are just under a period of
minor depression. We all get “bummed out” from time to time. The words and
melody of a hymn or a gospel song can bring such refreshment and blessing that
we experience a revival or recovery within our soul from the adverse condition.
We must remember that the thing that brings the refreshment is primarily the
lyrics of the song, the doctrinal message - not the melody or the rhythm.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Message of Refreshment</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Proverbs 25:13 is actually a proverb on biblical
refreshment. We should think of refreshment here from the standpoint of the one
who teaches the Word of God resulting in the message of the Word providing
encouragement and refreshment to its hearers. This verse is a short 3-line poem
and in this 3-line parable - the first line is the illustration of the next two
lines. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Like the cold of snow in the time of harvest Is a
faithful messenger to those who send him, For he refreshes the soul of his
masters.&quot;  (Proverbs 25:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first line gives us the illus­tration: “Like the cold
of snow in the time of harvest.” The time of harvest is a time when the farm
workers get very hot and it is a warm autumn day and they are very
uncomfortable. So they often had water boys sent to some near place where there
was snow. They would bring this snow down to the workers, but by the time they
got it down the hillside it was cold water. The snow referred to in this verse
is melted snow that is still cold and refreshing. The water boys would bring it
down in containers and the farm workers would all stop and take a drink of this
very, very refreshing water. This becomes the illustration for the next two
lines: “Is a faithful messenger to those who send him, For he refreshes the
soul of his masters.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the analogy, the com­municator of the Word, like a pastor-teacher,
is a “water boy.” He refreshes the souls of his masters or his congregation
that hears and applies the Bible doctrine in his messages. You see, the water
boy worked for everyone else. The refreshment to the Christian comes through
the one who is faithful and loyal in communicating Bible truth. It’s like cold
water that is refreshing. Refreshment in the Scripture is always connected with
the individual's soul. The teacher of doctrine is the key to the ministry of
refreshment. The point of total refreshment for the pastor is when believers
reach spiritual maturity while in his congregation. A mature believer is always
going to be a source of refreshment to those in their life. This is a part of
the blessing by association which overflows to other believers.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Refreshment and Misery to the Nation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Rejection of refreshment brings divine discipline upon a
nation. Isaiah explains why the nation is in such horrible trouble. It is not
because of the children, but the adults. The adults had become negative to the
Word of God that provides for their national blessing. Those adults could take
in the Word of God, or they could neglect and reject it. They chose to neglect
and reject Bible truth. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;To whom would He teach knowledge, And to whom would He
interpret the message? Those just weaned from milk? Those just taken from the
breast? &quot;For He says, 'Order on order, order on order, Line on line, line
on line, A little here, a little there.'&quot; Indeed, He will speak to this
people Through stammering lips and a foreign tongue, He who said to them,
&quot;Here is rest, give rest to the weary,&quot; And, &quot;Here is
repose,&quot; but they would not listen. So the word of the LORD to them will
be, &quot;Order on order, order on order, Line on line, line on line, A little
here, a little there,&quot; That they may go and stumble backward, be broken,
snared and taken captive. Therefore, hear the word of the LORD, O scoffers, Who
rule this people who are in Jerusalem,&quot;  (Isaiah 28:9-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Isaiah 28:10, “Order on order, order on order” refers
to teaching of Bible doctrine categorically. “A little here, a little there”
refers to the daily intake and utilization of Bible doctrine. In Isaiah 28:12,
“rest” refers to the Bible doctrine being taught that Israel has rejected and
also means refreshment. Doctrinal teaching gives rest or refreshment to the
weary, but cannot to those who reject the refreshment of Bible truth.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Isaiah 28:13, “That they may go and stumble backward,
be broken, snared and taken captive” means that they might go negative to the
teaching Bible doctrine and fall into apostasy. In view here also are the many
citizens of the nation who are in reversionism and have turned from the laws of
divine establishment and/or Bible doctrine and they are disciplined by their
enemies taking over their land. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Apostle Peter referred to the same principle in Acts
3:19. Peter is challenging those of the nation of Israel to change their minds
about what the Word of God says about Jesus Christ being their Messiah. In
other words, they should stop rejecting Him and they should receive Him. Their
returning to the Lord would be tantamount to recovering from national reversionism.
Their sins would be forgiven by God and a great time of revival would come to
the nation. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Therefore repent and return, so that your sins may
be wiped away, in order that times of refreshing may come from the presence of
the Lord;&quot;  (Acts 3:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>These “times of refreshing” is the only thing that can
save a nation as far gone as the Northern Kingdom in Isaiah's day or the Southern
Kingdom of Judea in Peter's time, or the USA today. “Times of refreshing” refer
to a reviv­al in the souls of believers. It refers to a revival of doctrinal
intake and doctrinal living in the lives of those who are born again. We must
always remember that revival within a country comes about as a result of a
spiritual awakening and/or a revival in the souls of believers.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Refreshment From a Growing Congregation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Refreshment comes from responding to the Word of God. In Romans
15:32, Paul was anticipating returning to Rome and he had joyous anticipation
of coming by the will of God to teach these believers in Rome and to refresh
them. Because refreshment is a two-way street, the believers in Rome will
refresh Paul by their response to his teaching of the Word, their love for God
and others, and their faithfulness and loyalty to the plan of God. All of this
will be the basis for encouragement and refreshment to Paul. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;so that I may come to you in joy by the will of God and
find refreshing rest in your company.&quot;  (Romans 15:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Also, in 2 Corinthians 7:13, Paul informs us that he has
been encouraged and comforted by the encouragement and comfort that Titus has
received from the congregation. The Christian should always rejoice over the
happiness of fellow believers. This is what he did concerning Titus because the
mental attitude of Titus was revived and refreshed by the Corinthian
congregation. Not only did Titus straighten out the Corinthians, but he made
some lifetime friendships. Many of these people were a source of refreshment to
Titus who was probably the greatest “troubleshooter” of the early days of the
Church Age.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For this reason we have been comforted. And besides our
comfort, we rejoiced even much more for the joy of Titus, because his spirit
has been refreshed by you all.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 7:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Refreshment and Spiritual Maturity</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The mature believer has a ministry of refreshment. This
is a part of their blessing by association. In their association with other believers,
they becomes a source of encouragement and refreshment. In 1 Corinthians
16:17-18, the Apostle Paul refers to three men who he enjoyed as lifetime
friends and were a source of great blessing to him. In 2 Timothy 1:16, Paul
refers to God continually extending mercy to the family of Onesiphorus. This believer
was a great source of encouragement to Paul and was one of those great
believers who refreshed Paul. In order to be a refreshment to the great
apostle, you really have to be something great in the spiritual life. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I rejoice over the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and
Achaicus, because they have supplied what was lacking on your part. For they
have refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore acknowledge such men.&quot;  (1
Corinthians 16:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he
often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains;&quot;  (2 Timothy 1:16,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Philemon 1:7 and Philemon 1:20, Paul refers to his
dear friend Philemon and the joy, encouragement, and love that they shared with
each other. Paul referred to the great source of encouragement and refreshment
that Philemon had been to fellow believers as well as to Paul himself. In
Philemon 1:20, he challenged Philemon to revive his encouragement by receiving
back into fellowship and good graces, his runaway slave, Onesimus.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For I have come to have much joy and comfort in your
love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you,
brother.&quot;  (Philemon 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Yes, brother, let me benefit from you in the Lord;
refresh my heart in Christ.&quot;  (Philemon 1:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Refreshment as a Mainstay</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The thinking of our Lord imparted to every believer by
learning and applying Bible doctrine provides respite and refreshment in our
times of pressure and adversity. The key word here is mainstay. A mainstay is the
confidence that we have in the God that we love and the stability and security
that He imparts to us through His Word which is such a blessing and
refreshment. During times of continued trial and tribulation, God’s grace,
through the power of His Word, gives us respite and refreshment which enables
us to keep pressing on in our spiritual growth.  Psalms 138:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Though I walk in the midst of trouble, You will revive
me; You will stretch forth Your hand against the wrath of my enemies, And Your
right hand will save me.&quot;  (Psalms 138:7, NASB)</p>
