<h2><a name="_D-Roman_Empire,_Caesars"></a><a name="_Roman_Empire,_Caesars"></a>Roman
Empire, Caesars and Emperors</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Summary Descriptions</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Julian Caesars: 49 BC - 68 AD </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Julian Caesars begins with Octavius and ends with
Nero. This period starts with excellent leadership, but progressively
degenerated resulting in the rule of Nero. Tiberius was reigning when Jesus
Christ was born. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Nero, the last of these, used to strap on himself a lion
skin with claws and personally claw to death Christians. He loved to tie
Christians to stakes, pour tar over them, and light them for human torches.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Flavian Caesars: 68 AD to 96 AD</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Flavian Caesars were the ones who conquered
Jerusalem. Vespasian started the siege of Jerusalem. Titus continued it and
concluded it. 1.9 million Jews died in a 90-day period.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Domitian was a real monster. He was responsible for
putting John on the Island of Patmos. The day Domitian died, the Canon of
Scripture was completed. The Book of Revelation was completed in 96 AD.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Antonine Caesars: 96-192 AD </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The seven Antonine Caesars included Nerva, Trajan,
Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, Marcus Aurelius, and Commodus. During this period,
there was a big push of Bible doctrine. With the completion of the written
Canon, Scripture copies were circulated all over the Roman Empire. During this
period, each church had a complete Canon of Scripture. Thousands of Bibles were
painstakingly detailed out by hand. During this time, the famous Sixth Legion,
composed of born-again men only, amassed the greatest military record of all
history. During this time, they supervised 100 years of continuous peace. You
could be safe in any Roman city, even bandits and thieves were being saved.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Historians gave many accounts of how the Word of God was
honored in those days. The greatest treasure of any home was the personal copy
of the Word of God. An area the size of the U.S.A. had no war for 100 years.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The period was capitalistic. Christianity changed the
stature of women from sleeping in stables to enjoying relative freedom. Charity
abounded to the poor. Government did not feed them, so it was handled through
personal charity. The only exception was the demon-possessed mob in Rome
numbering about one million people.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For the first time they were humane to animals in that
cats and dogs were not eaten for dinner, but became pets. Gibbon, a famous
historian writing of his era said, “If a man ware offered his choice of the age
in which its preferred to live, he would pick the period of the Antonine
emperors over any other period of history.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The historian Monson said, “If an angel or the Lord were
to strike a balance, the best time to live would have been in the period of the
Antonine Caesars.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Barrack Emperors: 193-264 AD</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>After a great wave of positive volition toward Bible
doctrine, there came a group of people who did not like Bible doctrine. And so
the holiness crowd moved in - the experience people. The emphasis was on
emotion with dedications, rededications, use of tongues in worship, and accepting
Jesus Christ as Lord. This was a time of controversy where positive volition
toward Bible doctrine declined terribly as emotionalism gained. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Various Emperors: 264 AD to the Fall of Rome in 476 AD
</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Diocletian: 285-305 AD. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Constantine: 312-337 AD. He did a very bad thing by uniting
church and state. This ruined Christianity. They totally rejected Bible
doctrine. The Empire lost their gold reserves during this time to China and
India up to 476 AD. Apostacy was rampant.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>German barbarians came along and began to overrun the
Roman Empire. Behind them came the Mongols. Finally in 476 AD, the Roman Empire
was put down by one of the German groups. Romulus was the last emperor, but
Constantine had sown the seeds for the Holy Roman Empire and from 476 AD on the
church and state united taking over the Roman code completely mixing it with
the Scriptural codex (law). </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Profiles of the Emperors </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Augustus: 27 BC - 14 AD</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Augustus was emperor at the birth of Christ. He was
commander in chief of the Roman army. He was appointed the permanent
representative of the people for life by the Roman Senate in 23 BC. He had the
right to introduce first business in Senate meetings and could call meetings.
His rights were founded on a constitutional basis. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He purged the Senate of unworthy members. He demobilized
much of the army and discharged veterans. Augustus created a regular
professional army. He revived the state religion and rebuilt the temples. He introduced
the worship of Rome as state in the provinces. He took a census of all the population
and property for military recruiting purposes and for taxation. He absorbed
Spain, Gaul, and the Alpine into the Roman Empire. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Augustus strengthened the defenses of his frontiers. His
army lost a big battle with the Germans in the Teutoburg forest. He organized
police and fire departments for Rome and appointed a secretary of agriculture to
supervise the grain supply. Augustus reigned 41 years and brought order out of
chaos, restored confidence in government, replenished the treasury, began an
efficient public works department, and promoted peace and prosperity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Tiberius: 14 - 37 AD</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Tiberius was emperor at the beginning of the Church. He
was the adopted son of Augustus. He took the throne at death of Augustus when
he was 56 years old. He had a political background. Augustus had forced him to
divorce his wife to marry Augustus’ daughter, a real woman about town. This
violation of volition and marriage institutions left Tiberius a bitter man for
life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He became suspicious, bitter, distant, and haughty. He
was impartial and fair, though usually feared more than liked. His armies also
lost to the Germans forcing a withdrawal of his frontier to the Rhine. He had
constant domestic troubles. He retired in 24 AD leaving the empire in the hands
of a subordinate. A conspiracy resulted, which when Tiberius found out was
stopped by executing the conspirators. This made him more suspicious and any
whisper would bring on the death sentence. He died in 37 AD. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Caligula: 37 - 41 AD </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Caligula was the successor of Tiberius. He was popular in
that he reduced taxes, pardoned political prisoners, gave public
entertainments, etc. He had definite signs of mental weakness and demanded to
be worshipped as a god. He was reckless in finances, spending freely, and soon
depleted the Roman treasury. This led to replenishing it by violent means in
the confiscation of property, compulsory legacies, and every kind of extortion.
Caligula became such a tyrant that he was assassinated by the Imperial Guards.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Claudius 41 - 54 AD</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Claudius was emperor during most of Paul’s ministry and
journeys. He was selected by the praetorian guard to succeed Caligula while the
senate was debating restoring the republic. He did not have political
background and had lived in obscurity. Claudius was a victim of some paralysis
illness leaving him in a weakened state and horrible form. He was a good
scholar and ruler.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Under Claudius, Rome became a bureaucracy with government
by committee and secretaries. He gave citizenship to the provinces. His armies
conquered part of Britain and he annexed Thrace. He attempted to restore
ancient Roman religion. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Claudius expelled some Jews from Rome because of
disturbances, which was possibly the reason why Aquilla and Priscilla left
Rome. He married a fourth wife, Agrippina, who proved to be his downfall.
Agrippina had a son, adopted by Claudius, under the name of Nero. Claudius died
a year later leaving the throne to Nero, having been poisoned by Agrippina.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Nero: 54 - 58 AD</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Nero was emperor under whom Paul and Peter were martyred.
The was the adopted son of Claudius. His first five years were successful and
peaceful. He had two main helpers; Sextus Afranius Burrus, the prefect of the
praetorian guard and Lucius Annaeus Seneca, a philosopher and writer. His
mother continued to maintain control over him and his advisors which they all
resented. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He took care of this triarch problem by having his mother
poisoned in 59 AD. By nature he was more artist than executive. He was
extravagant and careless, therefore, going quickly through the funds of the
treasury. Again, he also had to use violence to restore the treasury. In 62 AD,
he murdered his wife and married a Roman matron named Poppaea.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The senate grew to hate him. In 64 AD, a great fire
occurred and destroyed a large section of Rome. He was suspected, so he blamed
Christians to take the guilt from him. As a result many Christians were
arrested, tortured and killed to appease the loss. Tradition makes Peter and
Paul a part of those executed in this persecution. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Several times conspiracies arose to destroy him, but not
until a revolt of troops and provincials arose in Gaul and Spain was he
removed. Then he fled from Rome and was killed by his own men to avoid capture.
Some say he committed suicide. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He built an immense palace called to “Golden House” after
the fire. Jerome states: “Paul was dismissed by Nero that he might preach
Christ’s gospel also in the regions of the West.” This would be a reference to
Spain or Britain. Clement, Chrysostom, Theodoret and other fathers assert that
Paul went to Spain.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Galba: 68 AD </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Galba was the successor of Nero and established by the
military, but not with unanimous consent. He was killed at the instigation of
Otho who had been a former supporter. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Otho: 59 AD </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Otho’s appointment was accepted by the senate and he
became emperor. Vitellius of Germany marched on Rome. Otho was killed and
Vitellius took his place.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Vitellius: 69 AD </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Vitellius was recognized by the Senate.  He could not
control the military and could not establish a stable government. Vespasian, a
general in the eastern army, had Jerusalem under siege, but left the siege of Jerusalem
to Titus, his son, and went to Egypt to cut off the food supply to Rome.
Vespasian’s troops marched to Rome, conquered troops of Vitellius, captured and
sacked Rome, and killed Vitellius. Vespasian was made ruler.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Vespasian: 69 - 79 AD </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Vespasian was an old soldier type and a rigorous
administrator. His son, Titus, completed the conquering of Jews in 70 AD. He
made the treasury solvent by strict economy and new taxes. He built the famous
Colosseum. He died in 79 AD leaving office to Titus, previously made a
coregent. He was the first of the Flavian dynasty. His two sons Titus and
Domitian were to follow.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Titus: 79 - 81 AD</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Titus was one of the most popular emperors ever. He held
great public entertainments and was personally generous. During his reign was
the eruption of Vesuvius which destroyed Pompeii and Herculaneum on the Bay of
Naples. Titus did his utmost to rescue the victims. Rome was hit by another
great fire which destroyed the New Capitol, the Pantheon and Agrippa’s baths.
Titus sold some of his private furniture to contribute to the general need.  He
built new buildings and a large amphitheater.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Domitian 81 - 96 AD</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Domitian was emperor during John’s exile. He was the younger
brother of Titus and was  appointed by the senate as emperor at the death of
Titus. He was an autocrat. He attempted to establish or improve morals by
clamping down on public prostitution and restraining corruption on the stage.
He revived temples of older God's and suppressed outside religions. Persecution
of Christians was attributed to him. Domitian demanded worship of himself, was
an economist and used subordinates to carry out policy. By nature, he was
suspicious of rivals and was a hard man. His own family was so keenly suspicious
of Domitian that they secured his assassination.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Nerva: 95 - 98 AD </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Nerva was the first of the so-called “Good Emperors.” He focused
on reconstruction and economy to bring order out of chaos in the empire’s
finances. He reigned only about 16 months being an old man when taking the
throne. His reign was generally free from internal tensions and held the
military in check by appointing Trajan as his second, who was strong both in
the military and government administration.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Trajan: 98 - 117 AD</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Trajan was a Spaniard and a soldier by profession. He was
aggressive in temperament. He had a lot of revolts and insurrections. He
suppressed a revolt of the Jews in the Near East in 115 AD. He died in route to
the capital in Cilicia in 117 AD. He gave endorsement to the persecution
procedures of Pliny the Younger regarding persecution of Christians.</p>
