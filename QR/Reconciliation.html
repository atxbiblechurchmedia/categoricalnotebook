<h2><a name="_D-Reconciliation"></a><a name="_Reconciliation"></a>Reconciliation</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Reconciliation is peace with God because Jesus Christ
removed the sin barrier between God and mankind by His substitutionary
spiritual death on the Cross. All believers are reconciled to God the instant
they believe in Christ. God was never reconciled to mankind - mankind was
reconciled to God. The result of reconciliation is peace which replaces the
enmity between God and mankind at the point of salvation. Peace is a technical
word for man’s response to grace. Peace can never come to you apart from grace.
2 Cor. 5:18; Eph. 2:16; Col. 1:20-21. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now all these things are from God, who reconciled us to
Himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation,&quot;  (2
Corinthians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and might reconcile them both in one body to God through
the cross, by it having put to death the enmity.&quot;  (Ephesians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and through Him to reconcile all things to Himself,
having made peace through the blood of His cross; through Him, I say, whether
things on earth or things in heaven. And although you were formerly alienated
and hostile in mind, engaged in evil deeds,&quot;  (Colossians 1:20-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Greek verb <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>ποκαταλλα</span>́<span
lang=EL>σσω</span> (apokatallassō) means to reconcile or transfer from a
status of spiritual death to eternal salvation. The verb emphasizes the fact
that only God is the source of reconciliation. Man can do absolutely nothing in
reconciliation. Reconciliation sets up the pattern for our lives in that we are
helpless and dependent on the grace of God and all that our Lord Jesus Christ
has provided for us. Under grace, God has provided everything we need in our
lifetime. Under humility, we need to recognize our helplessness and God's grace
provision.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This means that there is nothing we can do to gain the acceptance
of God. All divine approval is based on grace and what God has done for us. We
are all too impressed by what we or others are doing for God. Getting your eyes
on other people is not a part of the plan of God. We should be impressed with
God and His plan for us. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Old Testament Portrayals of Reconciliation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Levitical offerings in the Old Testament portrayed
reconciliation. All Old Testament teaching is related to the ritual plan of God
for the dispensation of Israel. The peace offering teaches reconciliation. Lev.
3:1-2; Lev. 8:15. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;'Now if his offering is a sacrifice of peace offerings,
if he is going to offer out of the herd, whether male or female, he shall offer
it without defect before the LORD. 'He shall lay his hand on the head of his
offering and slay it at the doorway of the tent of meeting, and Aaron's sons
the priests shall sprinkle the blood around on the altar.&quot;  (Leviticus
3:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Next Moses slaughtered it and took the blood and with his
finger put some of it around on the horns of the altar, and purified the altar.
Then he poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar and
consecrated it, to make atonement for it.&quot;  (Leviticus 8:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The peace offering was a sacrifice of either a bull, cow,
lamb, or a goat that had no defect. Thanksgiving was associated with the peace
offering. Eating salt represented peace or reconciliation between two enemies. Lev.
2:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;'Every grain offering of yours, moreover, you shall
season with salt, so that the salt of the covenant of your God shall not be
lacking from your grain offering; with all your offerings you shall offer
salt.&quot;  (Leviticus 2:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Peace From Reconciliation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Peace is established between God and the believer the
moment he or she was reconciled to God through faith in Jesus Christ. There was
nothing we could do to establish this peace. We are also given God’s perfect
righteousness and His eternal life at salvation. We now have an eternal
relationship with God that can never be removed by anyone. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The manner in which Jesus Christ reconciles all things to
Himself begins in an overt way. When we believe in Jesus Christ for salvation,
our faith in Him comes from what we think. When we were still unbelievers and
in a state of spiritual death with all of the barriers still in place, all of
our thinking was hostile to God. Yet, God the Holy Spirit was able to make the
Gospel clear in our minds. He was able to make clear that the only way of
salvation was faith alone in Jesus Christ alone. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 5:1, the Greek noun <span lang=EL>ει</span>̓<span
lang=EL>ρη</span>́<span lang=EL>νη</span> (eirēnē) is translated “peace” and
is a synonym for reconciliation and emphasizes the saving work of Jesus Christ
on the Cross as removing the barrier or enmity between God and man. In Romans
5:10, the Greek verb <span lang=EL>καταλλα</span>́<span lang=EL>σσω</span>
(katallassō) means to change someone from a state of hostility into a state of
tranquility and peace, from enmity to reconciliation. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace
with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,&quot;  (Romans 5:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God
through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be
saved by His life.&quot;  (Romans 5:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Reconciliation between God and man must be ratified or
validated in every individual case through personal faith in Jesus Christ. Acts
16:31. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;They said, &quot;Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will
be saved, you and your household.&quot;&quot;  (Acts 16:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Mechanics of Reconciliation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are two categories of reconciliation. The first is
what Jesus Christ accomplished on the Cross for all mankind in reconciliation
and the second is what Jesus Christ provided through the Cross for all
believers at salvation. Reconciliation is our Lord's salvation ministry toward
man. In reconciliation, mankind is reconciled to God. God is never reconciled
to mankind.  This is why you cannot be saved by any other means than faith
alone in Christ alone.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Barriers Removed by Christ’s Work on the Cross for All
Mankind</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Each one of the items below shows what God has done for
the entire human race. So now there is no barrier, only an invisible line. Man
steps across that line and is given eternal salvation by simply believing in
the Lord Jesus Christ, because on the Cross all the work for salvation was
accomplished entirely by Him. These points are the issue in presenting the
Gospel. Sin is no longer an issue. All sin has already been judged. The only
issue remaining for the unbeliever is whether to accept the perfect work of
Christ on the Cross or to reject His work. Acceptance means eternal life.
Rejection means eternal separation from God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Barrier of Man’s Spiritual Death</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A barrier exists between God and man at physical birth
because we are all born spiritually dead. Spiritual death is total separation
from God due to our state of total depravity and complete helplessness to do
anything about it on our own. Spiritual death is the result of our physical
birth. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the moment of physical birth, God the Father creates
our soul and imputes it to our human format soul. The soul imputation results
in our first breath whereby we become a living human being, thus signaling that
God has a purpose for each member of the human race proven by His gift of
physical life. God simultaneously imputes Adam's original sin to the
genetically-formed old sin nature producing a physically living, but
spiritually dead human being. The old sin nature is the internal source of temptation
sin, human good, and evil. The volition of the soul is the source of sin. It is
the flawed character possessed by every human being which tempts us to sin. 
The sin nature is an integral part of every human being which resides in the
cell structure of the human body. Romans 6:6 presents the sin nature as the “old
self,” in Romans 7:5 as “the flesh,” and in Romans 7:18 as “my flesh.” </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;knowing this, that our old self was crucified with Him,
in order that our body of sin might be done away with, so that we would no
longer be slaves to sin;&quot;  (Romans 6:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For while we were in the flesh, the sinful passions,
which were aroused by the Law, were at work in the members of our body to bear
fruit for death.&quot;  (Romans 7:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my
flesh; for the willing is present in me, but the doing of the good is
not.&quot;  (Romans 7:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The sin nature was acquired originally by Adam at his
fall in the Garden of Eden and is transmitted only by the male sperm that
fertilizes the female ovum. The result is both spiritual death and total
depravity of all humanity and the sovereignty of the sin nature over human life.
Jesus Christ was unique in His humanity because He was born as a result of the
Holy Spirit fertilizing Mary (virgin pregnancy leading to the virgin birth).
Because no male human contributed any chromosomes, the sin nature was not passed
on. Therefore, Jesus Christ was born without a sin nature. Gen. 5:3; Rom. 6:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When Adam had lived one hundred and thirty years, he
became the father of a son in his own likeness, according to his image, and
named him Seth.&quot;  (Genesis 5:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so
that you obey its lusts,&quot;  (Romans 6:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Each of us must be “born again” to gain any relationship
with God. Faith in Jesus Christ is the only means. The barrier of man’s
spiritual death is removed by our Lord's perfect salvation ministry toward sin
for every member of the human race. This is called unlimited atonement. In
unlimited atonement, all personal sins of history where imputed to Christ on
the Cross and judged by God the Father. Gen. 2:16-17; Rom. 5:12; Rom. 6:23; Eph.
2:1; 1 Peter 2:24; 1 Peter 3:18; 2 Cor. 5:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The LORD God commanded the man, saying, &quot;From any
tree of the garden you may eat freely; but from the tree of the knowledge of
good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat from it you will
surely die.&quot;&quot;  (Genesis 2:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the
world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all
sinned—&quot;  (Romans 5:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God
is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.&quot;  (Romans 6:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And you were dead in your trespasses and sins,&quot; 
(Ephesians 2:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For Christ also died for sins once for all, the just for
the unjust, so that He might bring us to God, having been put to death in the
flesh, but made alive in the spirit;&quot;  (1 Peter 3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so
that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.&quot;  (2 Corinthians
5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Barrier of Man’s Personal Sins</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our personal sins are another barrier between God and man.
The imputation of all of our personal sins to Christ on the Cross was a major
factor in the removal of all barriers between us and God. The manifestations of
this barrier come in the form of personal sins. When tempted by the old sin
nature, our volition chooses to sin. Rom. 1:18-32; Rom. 3:9-23; Gal. 5:19-21; 1
Tim. 1:14-16.  Galatians 6:7 indicates that we make our own misery in life due
to our own self-determination.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are:
immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife,
jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions, envying,
drunkenness, carousing, and things like these, of which I forewarn you, just as
I have forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the
kingdom of God.&quot;  (Galatians 5:19-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and the grace of our Lord was more than abundant, with
the faith and love which are found in Christ Jesus. It is a trustworthy
statement, deserving full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to
save sinners, among whom I am foremost of all. Yet for this reason I found
mercy, so that in me as the foremost, Jesus Christ might demonstrate His
perfect patience as an example for those who would believe in Him for eternal
life.&quot;  (1 Timothy 1:14-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man
sows, this he will also reap.&quot;  (Galatians 6:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When Christ received the imputation of our sins, He paid
the penalty for our personal sins. He removed the barrier between God and man.
This was His substitutionary spiritual death on the Cross for each and every
one of us. As God, Jesus Christ can have nothing to do with sin. Sins were
imputed to Christ's humanity and judged by God the Father. This is why the sins
of the world were carried “in His body” on the Cross. All personal sins of
every human being that ever lived or will live were judged and removed from the
barrier. This is unlimited atonement. 2 Cor. 5:14-15; 2 Cor. 5:19; 1 Tim. 2:6;
1 Tim. 4:10; Titus 2:11; Heb. 2:9; 1 John 2:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For the love of Christ controls us, having concluded
this, that one died for all, therefore all died; and He died for all, so that
they who live might no longer live for themselves, but for Him who died and
rose again on their behalf.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 5:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;namely, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to
Himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and He has committed to us
the word of reconciliation.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 5:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;who gave Himself as a ransom for all, the testimony given
at the proper time.&quot;  (1 Timothy 2:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to
all men,&quot;  (Titus 2:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins; and not
for ours only, but also for those of the whole world.&quot;  (1 John 2:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Barrier of the Penalty of Sin</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The barrier of the penalty of sin was removed by
expiation or atonement through the saving work of Jesus Christ on the Cross.
Rom. 5:6, 1 Tim. 2:6, Col. 2:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For while we were still helpless, at the right time
Christ died for the ungodly.&quot;  (Romans 5:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;having canceled out the certificate of debt consisting of
decrees against us, which was hostile to us; and He has taken it out of the
way, having nailed it to the cross.&quot;  (Colossians 2:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Barrier of the Curse of the Law</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Mosaic Law forms a barrier to mankind because no one
is able to fulfill the morality of the Law by our own means. The curse of the
Law put each of us in the slave market of sin prior to salvation. We were
slaves to sin with no means to escape apart from the work of Christ on the
Cross. Our freedom was purchased from the slave market of sin by Jesus Christ. 
Jesus Christ paid for our freedom by being made a curse for us. This is called Redemption.
Eph. 2:15; 1 Tim. 1:8-11; Rom. 3:9-23; Gal. 3:10-11. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;by abolishing in His flesh the enmity, which is the Law
of commandments contained in ordinances, so that in Himself He might make the
two into one new man, thus establishing peace,&quot;  (Ephesians 2:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But we know that the Law is good, if one uses it
lawfully, realizing the fact that law is not made for a righteous person, but
for those who are lawless and rebellious, for the ungodly and sinners, for the
unholy and profane, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers
and immoral men and homosexuals and kidnappers and liars and perjurers, and
whatever else is contrary to sound teaching, according to the glorious gospel
of the blessed God, with which I have been entrusted.&quot;  (1 Timothy 1:8-11,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For as many as are of the works of the Law are under a
curse; for it is written, &quot;CURSED IS EVERYONE WHO DOES NOT ABIDE BY ALL
THINGS WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE LAW, TO PERFORM THEM.&quot; Now that no one
is justified by the Law before God is evident; for, &quot;THE RIGHTEOUS MAN
SHALL LIVE BY FAITH.&quot;&quot;  (Galatians 3:10-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Redemption teaches us that we are redeemed from the slave
market of sin by the saving work of Christ on the Cross. Psalms 34:22; Gal.
3:13; Eph. 1:7; 1 Peter 1:18-19; Titus 2:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The LORD redeems the soul of His servants, And none of
those who take refuge in Him will be condemned.&quot;  (Psalms 34:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;In Him we have redemption through His blood, the
forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace&quot; 
(Ephesians 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;who gave Himself for us to redeem us from every lawless
deed, and to purify for Himself a people for His own possession, zealous for
good deeds.&quot;  (Titus 2:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Barrier Between God’s Perfect Character and Man’s
Total Depravity</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is perfect and His perfect righteousness cannot have
any relationship with any creature that lacks perfect righteousness. Because of
man’s imperfect nature at birth and his inability to keep from sinning due to
the genetically formed sin nature, the best righteousness that man can ever
attain falls far short of God’s absolute righteousness (His glory). Rom. 3:23. 
</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of
God,&quot;  (Romans 3:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The barrier between God’s absolute and perfect holiness
and virtue and man’s total depravity is removed by our Lord's salvation
ministry toward God called Propitiation. Rom. 3:22-26; 1 John 2:2;1 John 4:10. </p>

<p class=Verses>“even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ
for all those who believe; for there is no distinction; for all have sinned and
fall short of the glory of God, being justified as a gift by His grace through
the redemption which is in Christ Jesus; whom God displayed publicly as a
propitiation in His blood through faith. This was to demonstrate His
righteousness, because in the forbearance of God He passed over the sins
previously committed; for the demonstration, I say, of His righteousness at the
present time, so that He would be just and the justifier of the one who has
faith in Jesus.” (Romans 3:22-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins; and not
for ours only, but also for those of the whole world.&quot;  (1 John 2:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved
us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins.&quot;  (1 John 4:10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In propitiation, God the Father was satisfied with the
salvation work of Christ on the Cross. God the Father is never satisfied with
any work man can do. If God the Father was satisfied with what our Lord did,
then God the Father can be satisfied with us when we are fulfilling His plan,
purpose, and will for our lives.</p>

Things</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Each of us are born physically alive, but spiritually
dead. In that condition, unsaved mankind (the natural man) is unable to
understand the spiritual things of God. At salvation, the believer is
regenerated by the Holy Spirit which means He creates a human spirit to which
God the Father imputes His very own eternal life and perfect righteousness. As
believers, we have both soul life and eternal life. 1 Cor. 2:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But a natural man does not accept the things of the
Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them,
because they are spiritually appraised.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 2:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Creation of a human spirit is called Regeneration. This
human spirit allows the believer to understand spiritual things only when the
believer is filled with the Holy Spirit. This is part of how God the Holy
Spirit teaches the believer the plan of God for his or her life. John 3:16;
John 3:36; Titus 3:5-7; 1 Peter 1:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;For God so loved the world, that He gave His only
begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal
life. &quot;  (John 3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he
who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on
him.&quot;&quot;  (John 3:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done
in righteousness, but according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration
and renewing by the Holy Spirit, whom He poured out upon us richly through
Jesus Christ our Savior, so that being justified by His grace we would be made
heirs according to the hope of eternal life.&quot;  (Titus 3:5-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;for you have been born again not of seed which is
perishable but imperishable, that is, through the living and enduring word of
God.&quot;  (1 Peter 1:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Barrier of Man’s Lack of Absolute Righteousness</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The imputation of God's perfect righteousness at the
moment of salvation solves the problem of man’s lack of perfect righteousness.
The very best any member of the human race can achieve (apart from the humanity
of Jesus Christ) is a far cry from God’s absolute and perfect righteousness.
God’s evaluation of the best man can do is found very clearly in Isaiah 64:6. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For all of us have become like one who is unclean, And
all our righteous deeds are like a filthy garment; And all of us wither like a
leaf, And our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.&quot;  (Isaiah 64:6,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The imputation of divine righteousness results in Justification.
Rom. 3:22; Rom. 4:2-5; Rom. 8:30; Gal. 2:16; Titus 3:7. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus
Christ for all those who believe; for there is no distinction;&quot;  (Romans
3:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and these whom He predestined, He also called; and these
whom He called, He also justified; and these whom He justified, He also
glorified.&quot;  (Romans 8:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;nevertheless knowing that a man is not justified by the
works of the Law but through faith in Christ Jesus, even we have believed in
Christ Jesus, so that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the
works of the Law; since by the works of the Law no flesh will be
justified.&quot;  (Galatians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;so that being justified by His grace we would be made
heirs according to the hope of eternal life.&quot;  (Titus 3:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Justification permits God to love the believer personally
without compromising His perfect essence. God is also free to impute grace to
that perfect righteousness to sustain us in this life. Matt. 6:33; 2 Cor. 9:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness,
and all these things will be added to you. &quot;  (Matthew 6:33, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that
always having all sufficiency in everything, you may have an abundance for
every good deed;&quot;  (2 Corinthians 9:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Barrier of Man’s Position in Adam</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All of us are born physically alive and spiritually dead.
We already know this is a barrier between God and man. Part of that spiritual
death is imputation at birth of Adam’s original sin by God the Father to our
genetically-formed old sin nature. Our resulting position in Adam as members of
the human race is also a barrier. Faith alone in Christ alone for salvation
also results in the Baptism of the Holy Spirit where he places us in union with
Jesus Christ. This makes us royal family and the heirs of God and is called
Positional Sanctification. Therefore, our previous position in Adam was
replaced by a new permanent and eternal position in Christ through the Baptism
of the Holy Spirit. 1 Cor. 15:22; 1 Cor. 12:13; Acts 1:5; Rom. 6:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be
made alive.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 15:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body,
whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink
of one Spirit.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 12:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized
with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.&quot; &quot;  (Acts 1:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized
into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?&quot;  (Romans 6:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Four Parties in Reconciliation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>God the Father</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first party in reconciliation is God the Father. God
the Father imputed the sins of every member of the human race to the humanity
of Jesus Christ on the Cross and judged every one of them. Jesus Christ
voluntarily accepted God’s judgement for every single sin based on His
unconditional love for each of us. The result of this substitutionary spiritual
death on the Cross is unlimited atonement. Christ’s saving work removed the
barrier of personal sins. God the Father was satisfied or propitiated with the
saving work of Christ on the Cross.  Propitiation removed the barrier between
the perfect righteousness and justice of God and imperfect and unrighteous man.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Propitiation allowed God the Father to impute His own
righteousness to every believer at salvation and proclaim us justified. Because
we were justified, we can now live with God forever. This removes the barrier
of man's lack of absolute righteousness. God the Father then imputed eternal
life to the believer's human spirit which had been created by the Holy Spirit
at salvation which is called Regeneration. This removed the barrier of man's
inability to understand spiritual things and inability to understand God’s will
for his or her life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Remember, mankind must be reconciled to God. God is never
reconciled to man. It is blasphemous to assume that God steps across any absolute
line of His perfect attributes to come to man. Man must make that conscious
decision of faith in Jesus Christ and cross the line to come to God. God has
already provided the means by grace. We must freely believe in order to receive
it all as grace from God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>God the Son</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The second party in reconciliation is God the Son or our
Lord Jesus Christ who is the agent of reconciliation. It was the work of our
Lord Jesus Christ that made reconciliation possible. Eph. 2:13-16.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But now in Christ Jesus you who formerly were far off
have been brought near by the blood of Christ. For He Himself is our peace, who
made both groups into one and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall, by
abolishing in His flesh the enmity, which is the Law of commandments contained
in ordinances, so that in Himself He might make the two into one new man, thus
establishing peace, and might reconcile them both in one body to God through
the cross, by it having put to death the enmity.&quot;  (Ephesians 2:13-16,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>During His last three hours on the Cross, our Lord's
humanity received the imputation of every personal sin of every member of the
human race and was then judged by God the Father.  Jesus Christ provided that
substitutionary spiritual death as well as the resulting unlimited atonement
for every member of the human race. Through His substitutionary spiritual death
on the Cross, Jesus Christ provided the means so that God the Father would be
perfectly satisfied or propitiated. Because personal faith in Jesus Christ
removes the barriers between man and God, our Lord is the agent of
reconciliation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>God the Holy Spirit</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The third party in reconciliation is God the Holy Spirit.
The unbeliever has only a body and a soul and thus cannot understand the Gospel
or any spiritual principles. Therefore, the Holy Spirit must make the Gospel
understandable to the unbeliever when it is presented by a believer. The Holy
Spirit acts as a human spirit, making the spiritual principles of the Gospel
understandable to the unbeliever. This is extremely important in understanding
how presenting the Gospel to the unbeliever does not depend on the perfect
delivery of the one witnessing, but on the perfect character and power of God
the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Holy Spirit creates a human spirit for the
imputation of eternal life to the believer at salvation. This is called Regeneration.
The believer can now understand spiritual principles or Bible doctrine. The
Holy Spirit also places every believer in union with Jesus Christ at the moment
of salvation. This is called the Baptism of the Holy Spirit. Every Church Age
believer is able to access the very power of God in their spiritual lives
through the filling of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Mankind</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fourth party in reconciliation is mankind who is the
beneficiary of reconciliation. Mankind is reconciled to God through the saving
work of Jesus Christ on the Cross. Mankind is always the recipient of
reconciliation and as such must be the one to approach God through faith in
Jesus Christ. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Believer’s Ministry of Reconciliation to
Unbelievers</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All Church Age believers have a personal ministry of
reconciliation toward the unbeliever. This ministry is taking every opportunity
to present the Gospel of salvation to unbelievers that we encounter in our
advance to spiritual maturity. Because every believer has gained the peace that
results from reconciliation, we are to share that grace gift to the unbeliever.
This personal ministry is not optional. God has commanded every believer to
witness to the unbeliever. We have a responsibility toward those who are not
yet reconciled to God to invite them to do so and share God’s eternal life
through faith alone in Christ alone. 2 Cor. 5:18-21; Eph. 6:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now all these things are from God, who reconciled us to
Himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation, namely, that
God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not counting their
trespasses against them, and He has committed to us the word of reconciliation.
Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were making an appeal
through us; we beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. He made Him
who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that we might become the
righteousness of God in Him.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 5:18-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and having shod YOUR FEET WITH THE PREPARATION OF THE
GOSPEL OF PEACE;&quot;  (Ephesians 6:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We were reconciled to God at salvation solely as a gift
of grace from God. This reconciliation provides each of us the daily
opportunity to go to others and invite them to be reconciled to God through
faith.  In giving the Gospel to the unbelievers we meet, we depend completely
on God the Holy Spirit to make the salvation message clear rather than any
salesmanship gimmicks we may have. It is grace all the way!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Reconciliation is totally the work of God and the
function of Christ bearing our sins on the Cross. Reconciliation emphasizes the
perfect essence of God as well as the eternal security of the believer. Since
we have been reconciled to God and possess His perfect righteousness, there is
nothing we can do, think, or say to cancel God's perfect and absolute work of
reconciliation. Jesus Christ’s perfect substitutionary spiritual death on the
Cross for all of mankind’s sins provided reconciliation. Through faith alone in
Christ alone, we gain that reconciliation for ourselves. Eph. 2:15-16; Rom.
5:8-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;by abolishing in His flesh the enmity, which is the Law
of commandments contained in ordinances, so that in Himself He might make the
two into one new man, thus establishing peace, and might reconcile them both in
one body to God through the cross, by it having put to death the enmity.&quot; 
(Ephesians 2:15-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that
while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, having now been
justified by His blood, we shall be saved from the wrath of God through Him.
For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His
Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life. And not
only this, but we also exult in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom
we have now received the reconciliation.&quot;  (Romans 5:8-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The phrase “the two” in Ephesians 2:15-16 refers to Jews
and Gentiles. The phrase “in His flesh” indicates that God the Father could
only impute man's sin to the humanity of Christ on the Cross. Jesus Christ’s
deity cannot ever have contact with sin.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When you believe in Jesus Christ, you are given a new
purpose in life – God’s purpose to replace your purpose. You are also given a
message, a ministry, and a title of ambassador for Jesus Christ. It doesn’t
matter who you were before salvation or how talented you were, or how famous,
or rich. The ministry of reconciliation is designed in exactly the same way
that reconciliation itself was designed. It was designed to be solely the work
of God, not the work of man. Man's ability is never the issue. 2 Cor. 5:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God
were making an appeal through us; we beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled
to God.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 5:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Since we have been given the ministry of reconciliation,
this means that every believer must accurately understand exactly how they were
saved and what the Gospel means. We are to understand that the only issue is
Jesus Christ, and then we can declare this. Our responsibility is to make the
issue clear, which you can do once you understand what Christ did for you.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>So once you understand the doctrine of reconciliation,
your witness will be effective because God the Holy Spirit will do the work,
using the doctrinal facts you communicate to others.  Every believer is to be a
carrier and communicator of Bible doctrine. Jesus Christ did the work, we are
reconciled to God the Father, the Holy Spirit reveals it, and we are merely the
recipients.  2 Cor. 5:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;namely, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to
Himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and He has committed to us
the word of reconciliation.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 5:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Note that God was “reconciling the world to Himself,” not
just the elect. This is unlimited atonement. Christ did not die spiritually
just for the elect - He died for all mankind - every member of the human race.
Reconciliation is an important basic doctrine. In living our spiritual lives
and growing in grace and knowledge of Jesus Christ, we become oriented more and
more to God’s grace plan for us and we begin to understand the importance of
Bible doctrine in our scale of values. We must always put our relationship with
God before relationships with other people.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Believer’s Ministry of Reconciliation to Other
Believers</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has established the basis of unity among believers in
reconciliation. God the Holy Spirit has established the basis of unity among
believers by regeneration because He gave all believers His very own eternal
life. God the Father established the basis for unity among believers by
imputing His perfect righteousness to all believers. God the Holy Spirit has
established the basis for unity among believers by entering each believer into
union with the person of Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Since all members of the royal family of God have been
reconciled to God at the moment of salvation, it follows logically that all
members of the Body of Christ should be reconciled to each other. We have been
reconciled to God by the work of Christ on the Cross. Therefore, we should use
what has been provided in grace by being reconciled to each other through the
filling of the Spirit after salvation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Consistent intake and application of Bible doctrine
through the filling of the Holy Spirit will begin to eliminate personality
conflicts because we take on more and more of the thinking of Jesus Christ. It
is this grace thinking that produces unconditional love between people that
depends solely on the integrity of the believer - not the worthiness of those
near us. 1 Cor. 2:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL
INSTRUCT HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Reconciliation toward each other means there is no place
for personality conflict in the Christian way of life. You are not to form
opinions about antagonisms that occur between two other Christians. Whenever
personality conflicts exist between two Christians, one or both are completely
out of line. They both need to confess their sins biblically to God the Father by
using 1 John 1:9 and through God’s grace, being restored to the filling of the
Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&quot;  (1 John
1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When you advance toward spiritual maturity, more of your
conflicts with others will be eliminated because you are using God’s thinking
to solve the problems - not your own. God does not cause personality conflict
in the Christian life. All problems are caused by arrogance which leads to such
thinking and behavior as jealousy, bitterness, fear, hatred, self-pity, guilt,
gossip, slander, and maligning. Therefore, when you find yourself in conflict
with another believer, look to your own life first because you are most likely
out of fellowship. Remember, no matter how obnoxious a person may be, you
should be able to handle it under the filling of the Spirit with God’s grace
thinking or simply thinking Bible doctrine that you have been taught.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Once you believe in Christ, personality conflicts are
inexcusable in the Christian way of life. No one can learn Bible doctrine and
have a personality conflict with their pastor. Personality conflict is usually
irrational. Whenever you have a personality conflict with someone else, this is
a warning that there is something wrong with your spiritual life. Personality
conflict is nothing more than God’s testing of your spiritual maturity. The
greatest personality conflict in history was the attitude of people toward
Jesus Christ while He lived on earth - especially while He was on the Cross.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Summary</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Reconciliation is the fact that Jesus Christ was judged
for our sins on the Cross which removed the barrier between God and man. This
barrier removal provides for man's reconciliation to God through faith in
Christ. The application of reconciliation to our spiritual lives is the fact
that, for believers, barriers between man and man will be removed as believers
advance in their spiritual growth. This advance to maturity and fulfillment of
God’s plan for each and every one of us is God’s plan and purpose for our being
here on earth. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The application of reconciliation also means preserving
unity among believers. When each believer was placed in union with Jesus Christ
by God the Holy Spirit at salvation, this is called Positional Sanctification.
This new position in Christ removed all barriers between believers. As we each
grow in grace and knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ, we begin to experience
this new position, called Experiential Sanctification. This living our lives as
unto the Lord is the means of creating and maintaining unity among believers.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Therefore, the entire human race is the recipient of
reconciliation. Since no barrier now exists, any unbeliever can step over the
line and enter into a relationship with God and be reconciled to God through
personal faith in Jesus Christ. The only possible remaining barrier that
remains is the continual unbelief of the unbeliever. This is the only thing
that Christ could not die for on the Cross. All they have to do is simply
believe in Jesus Christ. The work for salvation has already been accomplished. Acts
16:31; Eph. 2:8-9; 2 Cor. 5:19; Col. 1:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;They said, &quot;Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will
be saved, you and your household.&quot;&quot;  (Acts 16:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that
not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no
one may boast.&quot;  (Ephesians 2:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;namely, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to
Himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and He has committed to us
the word of reconciliation.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 5:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and through Him to reconcile all things to Himself,
having made peace through the blood of His cross; through Him, I say, whether
things on earth or things in heaven.&quot;  (Colossians 1:20, NASB)</p>
