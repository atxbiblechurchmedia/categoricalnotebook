<h2><a name="_Regeneration"></a><a name="_D-Regeneration"></a>Regeneration</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Regeneration is a theological term that refers to God the
Holy Spirit’s creation of a human spirit within the soul of every believer at
the point of salvation. This action occurs immediately following salvation
faith belief in the substitutionary spiritual death of Jesus Christ on the
Cross. Because we now have a human spirit, God the Father is then able to
impute or transfer His very own eternal life to that newly formed human spirit.
The result is the second birth or to be “born again.” John 3:3; John 3:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Jesus answered and said to him, &quot;Truly, truly, I say
to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.&quot;
&quot;  (John 3:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;Do not be amazed that I said to you, 'You must be
born again.' &quot;  (John 3:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A barrier exists between God and man at physical birth
because we are all born spiritually dead. Spiritual death is total separation
from God due to our state of total depravity (dead in trespasses and sin) and
complete helplessness to do anything about it on our own. Through regeneration,
the believer is made spiritually alive. Eph. 2:5-6; Col. 2:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us
alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved), and raised us up
with Him, and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,&quot; 
(Ephesians 2:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When you were dead in your transgressions and the
uncircumcision of your flesh, He made you alive together with Him, having
forgiven us all our transgressions,&quot;  (Colossians 2:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Physical Life Follows Physical Birth - the First Birth</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first birth is our physical birth into this world as
we emerge from our mother’s womb. God the Father imputes soul life to the baby
at the moment of physical birth. The baby would not live without this action by
God. This is the difference between biological life and human life. God’s
imputation of life to the baby demonstrates He has a purpose for each member of
the human race. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the moment of birth, God simultaneously imputes Adam's
original sin to the genetically-formed old sin nature producing a physically
living, but spiritually dead human being. The old sin nature is mankind’s internal
source of temptation to sin. Through our free will, we all choose to commit
personal sin, human good, and evil. The genetically-formed old sin nature is
the flawed character possessed by every human being which tempts us to sin. The
sin nature is an integral part of every human being residing within the
structure (nucleus) of every one of the some 30 trillion cells of the human
body.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Human life begins with the impartation of soul life at
physical birth. Our souls are immortal. However, the soul’s immortality does
not mean a person is qualified to live with God forever. Without salvation, the
soul will live forever in the Lake of Fire. The requirement to live with God
forever is to receive His very own eternal life. This is done following God the
Holy Spirit’s creation of a human spirit within the soul of every believer at
the point of salvation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The best illustration of the mechanics of a human being
transformed from a biologically living form to a living human being is the
creation of Adam in Genesis 2:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then the LORD God formed man of dust from the ground, and
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living
being.&quot;  (Genesis 2:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The phrase “formed man of the dust of the ground” refers
to biological life. The word “breathed into his nostrils” refers to God the
Father’s act of imputing soul life. This breath that generates human life is also
presented in Isaiah 42:5, John 1:3, and Colossians 1:16. The result is soul
life or <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>נשׁמה</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(neshâmâh) <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>חַיִּים</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(chayyim) in the Hebrew. The phrase
“became a living being” refers to Adam having been converted from a
biologically living form into a living human being with a living immortal soul.
We call this human life (body and soul) in contrast to biological life (body
only) or spiritual life (body, soul, and spirit).</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Thus says God the LORD, Who created the heavens and
stretched them out, Who spread out the earth and its offspring, Who gives
breath to the people on it And spirit to those who walk in it,&quot;  (Isaiah
42:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;All things came into being through Him, and apart from
Him nothing came into being that has come into being.&quot;  (John 1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For by Him all things were created, both in the heavens
and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or
authorities—all things have been created through Him and for Him.&quot; 
(Colossians 1:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is a great contrast between the unbreathing
physical body (biological life) and the breathing body with soul life (human
life). Until God exhaled His breath into the first human body, which was “formed”
biologically alive, man could not be a “living soul.” This is true for every
human being born throughout history.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Spiritual Life Follows Spiritual Birth - the Second
Birth</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>How is a person born again? All believers begin their
spiritual lives the same way - belief in the salvation work of Jesus Christ on
the Cross. This is the second birth. The Holy Spirit creates a human spirit for
the new believer (regeneration) so that the new believer is “born again.” John
3:3; Titus 3:5; Rom. 8:16; 1 Cor. 2:14; John 3:16; John 3:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Jesus answered and said to him, &quot;Truly, truly, I say
to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.&quot;
&quot;  (John 3:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done
in righteousness, but according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration
and renewing by the Holy Spirit,&quot;  (Titus 3:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are
children of God,&quot;  (Romans 8:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But a natural man does not accept the things of the
Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them,
because they are spiritually appraised.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 2:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;For God so loved the world, that He gave His only
begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal
life. &quot;  (John 3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;He who believes in Him is not judged; he who does
not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of
the only begotten Son of God. &quot;  (John 3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are made sons of God at salvation through faith in
Jesus Christ. John 1:11-12; Gal. 3:26. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He came to His own, and those who were His own did not
receive Him. But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become
children of God, even to those who believe in His name,&quot;  (John 1:11-12,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ
Jesus.&quot;  (Galatians 3:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Eternal life begins at regeneration, which is believing
in the salvation work of Jesus Christ. Just as mankind does no deed or work for
physical life, so mankind does no deed or work for eternal life. The first
birth is the origin of human life. The second birth is the origin of eternal
life where we become a new creature.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In both births, the work and grace of God is the issue.
The issue for those who have accepted Jesus Christ as their personal Savior is
what will you do about it. We are commanded to grow in grace and knowledge of
Jesus Christ. 2 Peter 3:18. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and
Savior Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory, both now and to the day of eternity.
Amen.&quot;  (2 Peter 3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers are the workmanship of our Lord and are capable
performing divine good. All divine good on earth is done by believers filled
with the Holy Spirit. We are provided all of God's grace resources to do so. Eph.
2:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for
good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.&quot; 
(Ephesians 2:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>With our new means of spiritual growth – the grace
apparatus for perception plus the filling of the Holy Spirit, we can construct an
edification complex in the right lobe of the soul to be used for application to
life’s issues and decisions. 2 Cor. 5:17; Col. 2:6-7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creature;
the old things passed away; behold, new things have come.&quot;  (2 Corinthians
5:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so
walk in Him, having been firmly rooted and now being built up in Him and
established in your faith, just as you were instructed, and overflowing with
gratitude.&quot;  (Colossians 2:6-7, NASB)</p>
