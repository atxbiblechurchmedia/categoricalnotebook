<h2>Resurrections</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Scripture distinguishes between two types of resurrections
– one type for believers and another type for unbelievers. In Acts 24:15, “the righteous”
are the believers who have been justified through faith in Jesus Christ whereas
“the wicked” are those who rejected the work of Jesus Christ. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;having a hope in God, which these men cherish themselves,
that there shall certainly be a resurrection of both the righteous and the
wicked.&quot;  (Acts 24:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 5:24-29, “did the good deeds” refers to belief in
Jesus Christ and “those who committed the evil deeds” refers to rejection of
the work of Jesus Christ. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears My word,
and believes Him who sent Me, has eternal life, and does not come into
judgment, but has passed out of death into life. &quot;Truly, truly, I say to
you, an hour is coming and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son
of God, and those who hear will live. &quot;For just as the Father has life in
Himself, even so He gave to the Son also to have life in Himself; and He gave
Him authority to execute judgment, because He is the Son of Man. &quot;Do not
marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will
hear His voice, and will come forth; those who did the good deeds to a
resurrection of life, those who committed the evil deeds to a resurrection of
judgment. &quot;  (John 5:24-29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is no condemnation (judgment) in eternity for those
who are in Christ Jesus. This principle applies to all those who believe in
Jesus Christ in any dispensation or age. The Judgment Seat of Christ will be for
believers only and will be for what the believer did with their time on earth –
the production of human good works (which will be rejected) and for their
divine good production (which will be rewarded). Rom. 8:1. See category on the <a
href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/J/Judgment%20Seat%20of%20Christ.html">Judgment Seat of Christ</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are
in Christ Jesus.&quot;  (Romans 8:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The First Resurrection</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first to be resurrected was our Lord Jesus Christ. The
second group to be resurrected will be all Church Age believers at the Rapture of
the Church or the Exit Resurrection. The third group to be resurrected will be
all believers from the Age of Israel. This includes all Old Testament believers
and all Tribulational believers. The fourth group to be resurrected will be
Millennial believers. All believers of all dispensations are included in what
is called the “first resurrection” of Revelation 20:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The rest of the dead did not come to life until the
thousand years were completed. This is the first resurrection.&quot; 
(Revelation 20:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Our Lord Jesus Christ </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first to be resurrected was our Lord Jesus Christ as
He was the “first fruits.” 1 Cor. 15:20-23.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits
of those who are asleep. For since by a man came death, by a man also came the
resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be
made alive. But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, after that
those who are Christ’s at His coming,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 15:20-23,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There were no resurrections before Jesus Christ’s because
His resurrection is the guarantee of the believer’s resurrection. His physical
death occurred at about April 32 AD. His body went into the grave. His soul
went into Paradise. His human spirit went into the presence of the Father. John
19:40-42; Luke 23:43; Acts 2:27; Luke 23:46.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen
wrappings with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews. Now in the
place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb
in which no one had yet been laid. Therefore because of the Jewish day of
preparation, since the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.&quot;  (John
19:40-42, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He said to him, &quot;Truly I say to you, today you
shall be with Me in Paradise.&quot; &quot;  (Luke 23:43, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;BECAUSE YOU WILL NOT ABANDON MY SOUL TO HADES, NOR ALLOW
YOUR HOLY ONE TO UNDERGO DECAY.&quot;  (Acts 2:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And Jesus, crying out with a loud voice, said,
&quot;Father, INTO YOUR HANDS I COMMIT MY SPIRIT.&quot; Having said this, He
breathed His last.&quot;  (Luke 23:46, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At His resurrection, He returned with a resurrection body.
His soul came out of Paradise and returned to His physical body. His human
spirit came down from the presence of the Father, went into the body and rose
from the grave. Forty days later, He ascended to the Third Heaven – the throne
room of God the Father and was seated at the right hand of the Father in the
place of highest honor. Heb. 1:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He is the radiance of His glory and the exact
representation of His nature, and upholds all things by the word of His power.
When He had made purification of sins, He sat down at the right hand of the
Majesty on high,&quot;  (Hebrews 1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'><u>Church Age Believers</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>The second group to be
resurrected will be all Church Age believers. At death, our bodies go into the
grave. Our soul and human spirit go into the presence of the Father. 1 Thess.
4:16-17; 2 Cor. 5:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a
shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, and the
dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain will be caught
up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we
shall always be with the Lord.&quot;  (1 Thessalonians 4:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;we are of good courage, I say, and prefer rather to be
absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord.&quot;  (2 Corinthians
5:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the time of our resurrection at the Rapture of the
Church, our soul and the human spirit will enter our newly created resurrection
body. The Rapture of the Church signals the end of the Church Age. 1 Cor 15:23;
Phil. 3:21; 1 John 3:1-2; 1 Cor. 15:51-57.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, after
that those who are Christ's at His coming,&quot;  (1 Corinthians 15:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;who will transform the body of our humble state into
conformity with the body of His glory, by the exertion of the power that He has
even to subject all things to Himself.&quot;  (Philippians 3:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;See how great a love the Father has bestowed on us, that
we would be called children of God; and such we are. For this reason the world
does not know us, because it did not know Him. Beloved, now we are children of
God, and it has not appeared as yet what we will be. We know that when He
appears, we will be like Him, because we will see Him just as He is.&quot;  (1
John 3:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Old Testament and Tribulation Believers</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The third group to be resurrected will be all believers
from the Age of Israel (Jewish Age) when the Age of Israel is completed at the
end of the Tribulation - the Second Advent of Jesus Christ.<u> </u>This
includes all Old Testament believers and all Tribulation believers. 1 Cor.
15:24-25; Dan. 12:1-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“then comes the end, when He hands over the kingdom to the God
and Father, when He has abolished all rule and all authority and power. For He
must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Corinthians 15:24-25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““Now at that time Michael, the great prince who stands guard
over the sons of your people, will arise. And there will be a time of distress
such as never occurred since there was a nation until that time; and at that
time your people, everyone who is found written in the book, will be rescued. “Many
of those who sleep in the dust of the ground will awake, these to everlasting
life, but the others to disgrace and everlasting contempt. “Those who have
insight will shine brightly like the brightness of the expanse of heaven, and
those who lead the many to righteousness, like the stars forever and ever.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Daniel
12:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Prior to our Lord’s resurrection, following physical
death for all Old Testament believers, their bodies went into the grave and their
soul and human spirit went to Paradise which is part of Sheol or Hades. Following
our Lord’s ascension into heaven, as part of the Triumphal Procession following
the seating of Jesus Christ at the right hand of God the Father, our Lord Jesus
Christ transferred the souls and human spirits of all Old Testament believers
to a New Paradise in the Third Heaven. Here, they still await resurrection. Eph.
4:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore it says, &quot;WHEN HE ASCENDED ON HIGH, HE LED
CAPTIVE A HOST OF CAPTIVES, AND HE GAVE GIFTS TO MEN.&quot;&quot;  (Ephesians
4:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Upon our Lord’s return at the Second Advent, Old
Testament and Tribulation believers who have died will receive resurrection
bodies. This will complete the Age of Israel. Rev. 11:18; 2 Cor. 5:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;And the nations were enraged, and Your wrath came,
and the time came for the dead to be judged, and the time to reward Your
bond-servants the prophets and the saints and those who fear Your name, the
small and the great, and to destroy those who destroy the earth.&quot;&quot; 
(Revelation 11:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;we are of good courage, I say, and prefer rather to be
absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord.&quot;  (2 Corinthians
5:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Peter’s sermon on the Day of Pentecost spoke of the resurrection
of Jesus Christ. Acts 2:29-31.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Brethren, I may confidently say to you regarding
the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us
to this day. &quot;And so, because he was a prophet and knew that GOD HAD SWORN
TO HIM WITH AN OATH TO SEAT one OF HIS DESCENDANTS ON HIS THRONE, he looked
ahead and spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that HE WAS NEITHER
ABANDONED TO HADES, NOR DID His flesh SUFFER DECAY.&quot;  (Acts 2:29-31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>On the Day of Pentecost, 50 days after Jesus Christ’s
resurrection, David was still in the tomb. The Old Testament saints were not
out of the grave on the Day of Pentecost, so they could not have been
resurrected at Jesus Christ’s resurrection. If the two witnesses Moses and
Elijah had resurrection bodies during the Tribulation, it would be impossible
for them to be killed. Resurrection bodies cannot die. Rev. 11:3-13; Matt.
16:20 - Matt. 17:3.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Scriptures show the time of resurrection of Old
Testament saints. In Daniel 12:13, “end of the age” refers to the end of the
Jewish Age.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;But as for you, go your way to the end; then you
will enter into rest and rise again for your allotted portion at the end of the
age.&quot;&quot;  (Daniel 12:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Isaiah 26:19-21 refers to the Old Testament saints
(Jewish Age believers). “Indignation” refers to the Tribulation. “Behold, the Lord
is about to come out from His place” refers to the Second Advent of Jesus
Christ.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Your dead will live; Their corpses will rise. You who lie
in the dust, awake and shout for joy, For your dew is as the dew of the dawn,
And the earth will give birth to the departed spirits. Come, my people, enter
into your rooms And close your doors behind you; Hide for a little while Until
indignation runs its course. For behold, the LORD is about to come out from His
place To punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity; And the earth
will reveal her bloodshed And will no longer cover her slain.&quot;  (Isaiah
26:19-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At Jesus Christ’s resurrection in Matthew 27:50-54, the “many
bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised” refers to resuscitated Old
Testament believers. They did not have resurrection bodies. Although not
directly stated in Scripture, it is likely they were believers who had recently
died because they were recognized when they entered Jerusalem to announce the
fact that Jesus Christ had risen. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and yielded
up His spirit. And behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to
bottom; and the earth shook and the rocks were split. The tombs were opened,
and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised; and coming out
of the tombs after His resurrection they entered the holy city and appeared to
many. Now the centurion, and those who were with him keeping guard over Jesus,
when they saw the earthquake and the things that were happening, became very
frightened and said, &quot;Truly this was the Son of God!&quot;&quot;  (Matthew
27:50-54, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Unconditional Covenants to Israel will be fulfilled
at the Second Advent. Part of the fulfillment of these covenants is
resurrection of all believers involved, so resurrection of Jewish Age believers
is not necessary until the Second Advent.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Millennial Believers</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fourth group to be resurrected will be Millennial believers.
If they die during  the Millennium, their resurrection will be at the end of
the Millennium. Tribulation believers alive at the Second Advent who will go
into the Millennium in physical bodies, will receive their resurrection body at
the end of the Millennium. Rev. 11:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;And the nations were enraged, and Your wrath came,
and the time came for the dead to be judged, and the time to reward Your
bond-servants the prophets and the saints and those who fear Your name, the
small and the great, and to destroy those who destroy the earth.&quot;&quot; 
(Revelation 11:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Resurrection For the Great White Throne Judgment</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At death for the unbeliever, the body goes into the
grave. The soul goes into Torments in Hades until the end of the Millennium
awaiting the Great White Throne Judgment. Luke 16:19-31.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Now the poor man died and was carried away by the angels
to Abraham's bosom; and the rich man also died and was buried. &quot;In Hades
he lifted up his eyes, being in torment, and saw Abraham far away and Lazarus
in his bosom.” (Luke 16:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The resurrection for unbelievers for all dispensations occurs
at the end of the Millennium. This is the resurrection of damnation. They have
no human spirit and remain spiritually dead just as when they were born. Rev.
20:4-5; Rev. 20:11-15.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment
was given to them. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because
of their testimony of Jesus and because of the word of God, and those who had
not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received the mark on their
forehead and on their hand; and they came to life and reigned with Christ for a
thousand years. The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand
years were completed. This is the first resurrection.&quot;  (Revelation
20:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat upon it,
from whose presence earth and heaven fled away, and no place was found for
them. And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne,
and books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life;
and the dead were judged from the things which were written in the books,
according to their deeds. And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and
death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged,
every one of them according to their deeds. Then death and Hades were thrown
into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire. And if
anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the
lake of fire.&quot;  (Revelation 20:11-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At resurrection, the unbeliever will receive some kind of
a body (no biblical information). The soul will join that new body to appear at
the Great White Throne Judgment. Following that judgment, they have but one
destination – the “Second Death,” the Lake of Fire for eternity.</p>
