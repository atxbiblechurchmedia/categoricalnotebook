<h2>Resurrection of Jesus Christ</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The word “resurrection” is taken from a Greek word <span
lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>να</span>́<span lang=EL>στασις</span>
(anastasis) and means to stand up, to rise from the dead, to be raised to life
again. Resurrection means to be physically raised from the dead and to receive
a body that will never perish again, an everlasting body. 1 Cor. 15:42.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown a
perishable body, it is raised an imperishable body;” (1 Corinthians 15:42,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We commemorate Easter because Jesus Christ our Savior was
physically resurrected to life after He was dead. We don’t commemorate Easter
for Easter bunnies and eggs, for the smell of spring in the air, for the
pageantry, or the ritual. Easter emphasizes the finished work of Christ and
that now we are to be occupied with a living Savior! </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Morning Order of Resurrection Events </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The time of resurrection was after the Sabbath, after
sundown on Saturday night. Our Lord rose from the dead on the first day of the
week. The order of events of the resurrection morning are briefly described
below.   </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A severe earthquake occurred. An angel had rolled away
the large stone from our Lord’s tomb. The stone was not rolled away to let
Jesus Christ out, but to let the human race in. Our Lord had already risen. Three
women came to the tomb at the crack of dawn - Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother
of James, and Salome. Matt. 28:1-2; Mark 16:1. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first
day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to look at the grave.
And behold, a severe earthquake had occurred, for an angel of the Lord
descended from heaven and came and rolled away the stone and sat upon it.”
(Matthew 28:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother
of James, and Salome, bought spices, so that they might come and anoint Him.”
(Mark 16:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mary Magdalene, after seeing the stone rolled away, left
the tomb to find the disciples. She found Peter and John and they returned to
the tomb. Peter wondered about what he saw. John believed Jesus had risen. John
20:1-2; Luke 24:12; John 20:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene came early to
the tomb, while it was still dark, and saw the stone already taken away from
the tomb. So she ran and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom
Jesus loved, and said to them, &quot;They have taken away the Lord out of the
tomb, and we do not know where they have laid Him.&quot;” (John 20:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But Peter got up and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in,
he saw the linen wrappings only; and he went away to his home, marveling at
what had happened.” (Luke 24:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So the other disciple who had first come to the tomb then also
entered, and he saw and believed.” (John 20:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mary and Salome saw the angel who told them that “He has
risen.” Mark 16:5-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting at the right,
wearing a white robe; and they were amazed. And he said to them, &quot;Do not
be amazed; you are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who has been crucified. He
has risen; He is not here; behold, here is the place where they laid Him.”
(Mark 16:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mary Magdalene came again to the tomb, but mistook the
resurrected Jesus Christ for the gardener. John 20:11-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But Mary was standing outside the tomb weeping; and so, as she
wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb; and she saw two angels in white
sitting, one at the head and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had been
lying. And they said to her, &quot;Woman, why are you weeping?&quot; She said
to them, &quot;Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where
they have laid Him.&quot; When she had said this, she turned around and saw
Jesus standing there, and did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to her,
&quot;Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?&quot; Supposing Him to
be the gardener, she said to Him, &quot;Sir, if you have carried Him away, tell
me where you have laid Him, and I will take Him away.&quot; Jesus said to her,
&quot;Mary!&quot; She turned and said to Him in Hebrew, &quot;Rabboni!&quot;
(which means, Teacher). Jesus said to her, &quot;Stop clinging to Me, for I
have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brethren and say to them, 'I
ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God.'&quot; Mary
Magdalene came, announcing to the disciples, &quot;I have seen the Lord,&quot;
and that He had said these things to her.” (John 20:11-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The announcement of the resurrection is given in Matthew
28:3-5 because of the Angelic Conflict. Angelic bodies are composed of light
and travel in space. Adam’s and Eve’s bodies before they sinned were covered
with light. Satan, who had possessed the serpent in the Garden, also had a
quality of light. The guards at the tomb of our Lord became as dead men. No
words were spoken to them. The angel of the Lord addresses only the believers
present – the women. He told them that Jesus Christ had risen and for them to
go tell the disciples. Matt. 28:6-8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And his appearance was like lightning, and his clothing as
white as snow. The guards shook for fear of him and became like dead men. The
angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid; for I know that you are looking for
Jesus who has been crucified.”  (Matthew 28:3-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““He is not here, for He has risen, just as He said. Come, see
the place where He was lying. “Go quickly and tell His disciples that He has
risen from the dead; and behold, He is going ahead of you into Galilee, there
you will see Him; behold, I have told you.” And they left the tomb quickly with
fear and great joy and ran to report it to His disciples.”  (Matthew 28:6-8,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Timetable of Our Lord’s Death, Burial, and
Resurrection</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The End of the Sabbath (First Day of the Week)</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The diagram below depicts the relationship between
Gentile time and Jewish time as they relate to the major event of our Lord’s
death, burial, and resurrection. Matt. 28:1; Luke 24:1; John 20:1; Mark 16:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first
day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to look at the grave.”
(Matthew 28:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came to
the tomb bringing the spices which they had prepared.” (Luke 24:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene came early to
the tomb, while it was still dark, and saw the stone already taken away from
the tomb.” (John 20:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Very early on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb
when the sun had risen.” (Mark 16:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><img width=520 height=510 id="Picture 1"
src="Resurrection%20of%20Jesus%20Christ.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Characteristics of our Lord’s Resurrection Body</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One day, all Church Age believers will have a
resurrection body exactly like the Lord’s. Phil. 3:21; 1 John 3:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“who will transform the body of our humble state into
conformity with the body of His glory, by the exertion of the power that He has
even to subject all things to Himself.”  (Philippians 3:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Beloved, now we are children of God, and it has not appeared
as yet what we will be. We know that when He appears, we will be like Him,
because we will see Him just as He is.”  (1 John 3:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord’s resurrection body retained the nail holes and the
scar of the wound in His side. He had some kind of epidermis similar to ours
since it showed scars. We won’t have scars, but Jesus Christ does. John
20:25-27; Zech. 12:10; Psalms 22:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So the other disciples were saying to him, &quot;We have seen
the Lord!&quot; But he said to them, &quot;Unless I see in His hands the
imprint of the nails, and put my finger into the place of the nails, and put my
hand into His side, I will not believe.&quot; After eight days His disciples
were again inside, and Thomas with them. Jesus came, the doors having been
shut, and stood in their midst and said, &quot;Peace be with you.&quot; Then He
said to Thomas, &quot;Reach here with your finger, and see My hands; and reach
here your hand and put it into My side; and do not be unbelieving, but
believing.&quot;” (John 20:25-27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I will pour out on the house of David and on the
inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and of supplication, so that they
will look on Me whom they have pierced; and they will mourn for Him, as one
mourns for an only son, and they will weep bitterly over Him like the bitter
weeping over a firstborn.” (Zechariah 12:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For dogs have surrounded me; A band of evildoers has
encompassed me; They pierced my hands and my feet.” (Psalms 22:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord’s resurrection body was recognizable as a human
body. He made 17 post-resurrection appearances. Luke 24; John 20:26-29.</p>

<p class=Verses>“After eight days His disciples were again inside, and Thomas
with them. Jesus came, the doors having been shut, and stood in their midst and
said, &quot;Peace be with you.&quot; Then He said to Thomas, &quot;Reach here
with your finger, and see My hands; and reach here your hand and put it into My
side; and do not be unbelieving, but believing.&quot; Thomas answered and said
to Him, &quot;My Lord and my God!&quot; Jesus said to him, &quot;Because you
have seen Me, have you believed? Blessed are they who did not see, and yet
believed.&quot;” (John 20:26-29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>His resurrection body has substance (flesh and bones) and
could be touched. Luke 24:39-40; Matt. 28:9; John 20:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;See My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself; touch Me
and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I
have.&quot; And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and His feet.”
(Luke 24:39-40, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And behold, Jesus met them and greeted them. And they came up
and took hold of His feet and worshiped Him.” (Matthew 28:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Jesus said to her, &quot;Stop clinging to Me, for I have not
yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brethren and say to them, 'I ascend to
My Father and your Father, and My God and your God.'&quot;” (John 20:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord could breathe, but He did not necessarily need
to breathe. He carried on conversations, so His resurrection body must have
some system of vocal cords and the use of air. His voice and features were
recognizable immediately. John 20:22; Luke 24; John 20:26; John 20:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And when He had said this, He breathed on them and said to
them, &quot;Receive the Holy Spirit.” (John 20:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“After eight days His disciples were again inside, and Thomas
with them. Jesus came, the doors having been shut, and stood in their midst and
said, &quot;Peace be with you.&quot;” (John 20:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Jesus said to her, &quot;Mary!&quot; She turned and said to
Him in Hebrew, &quot;Rabboni!&quot; (which means, Teacher).” (John 20:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>On one occasion He ate, but He didn’t have to eat. He
could eat or go without food. Luke 24:30; Luke 24:43.</p>

<p class=Verses>“When He had reclined at the table with them, He took the bread
and blessed it, and breaking it, He began giving it to them.” (Luke 24:30,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and He took it and ate it before them.” (Luke 24:43, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>His resurrection body structure is different than ours because
Jesus walked through closed and locked doors. John 20:19; John 20:26; Luke
24:36.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So when it was evening on that day, the first day of the week,
and when the doors were shut where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews,
Jesus came and stood in their midst and said to them, &quot;Peace be with
you.&quot;” (John 20:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“After eight days His disciples were again inside, and Thomas
with them. Jesus came, the doors having been shut, and stood in their midst and
said, &quot;Peace be with you.&quot;” (John 20:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“While they were telling these things, He Himself stood in
their midst and said to them, &quot;Peace be to you.&quot;” (Luke 24:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He could appear and disappear at will. The resurrection
body could move vertically and horizontally. Luke 24:17; Matt. 28:10; Acts
1:9-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He said to them, &quot;What are these words that you are
exchanging with one another as you are walking?&quot; And they stood still,
looking sad.” (Luke 24:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Jesus said to them, &quot;Do not be afraid; go and take
word to My brethren to leave for Galilee, and there they will see Me.&quot;”
(Matthew 28:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And after He had said these things, He was lifted up while
they were looking on, and a cloud received Him out of their sight. And as they
were gazing intently into the sky while He was going, behold, two men in white
clothing stood beside them. They also said, &quot;Men of Galilee, why do you
stand looking into the sky? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into
heaven, will come in just the same way as you have watched Him go into
heaven.&quot;” (Acts 1:9-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Reactions to the Resurrection of Jesus Christ </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If ever in life you have been touched or concerned by
death, resurrection is good news for you. The biblical account of Christ’s
death does not end at the Cross or at the tomb. The Gospel includes
resurrection truth. The Cross was dealing with the bad news that all mankind
had sinned and the Innocent One was taking on the sin of the guilty.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The tomb was identified with the death and has a sorrow
and a sting. It has a separation and setting of solemnity. But resurrection is
identified with life and that life is described as being eternal. Even though
the resurrection is always good news, there were different reactions to the
resurrection. In what group do you find yourself?</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Perplexity</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Perplexity means to see no way out, to be in a quandary,
to be quite at a loss to explain the situation, or confused because it didn’t
come out the way you expected it would. For example, you remember parking your
car in a certain place, but when you came back, it was not there. Luke 24:1-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came to
the tomb bringing the spices which they had prepared. And they found the stone
rolled away from the tomb, but when they entered, they did not find the body of
the Lord Jesus. While they were perplexed about this, behold, two men suddenly
stood near them in dazzling clothing;”  (Luke 24:1-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The stone was rolled away and the body was not there. It
would be like visiting the grave of someone close to you in your family that
has gone to be with the Lord and finding no tombstone or any trace that it was
there. The Lord came to the rescue of their perplexity with the arrival of the
two angels to announce the risen Christ. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Unbelief and Hardness of Heart</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To many, resurrection seems like an idle tale. They might
say, “That sounds unbelievable, do you expect me to believe that?” Luke 24:11;
Luke 24:25; 1 Cor. 1:18; 1 Cor. 1:21-24. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But these words appeared to them as nonsense, and they would
not believe them.”  (Luke 24:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He said to them, “O foolish men and slow of heart to
believe in all that the prophets have spoken! “  (Luke 24:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are
perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.”  (1
Corinthians 1:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom
did not come to know God, God was well-pleased through the foolishness of the
message preached to save those who believe. For indeed Jews ask for signs and
Greeks search for wisdom; but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling
block and to Gentiles foolishness, but to those who are the called, both Jews
and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.”  (1 Corinthians
1:21-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Unbelief is regarding the Cross and resurrection as an
idle tale or foolishness. This is the manifestation of unbelief in an
unbeliever or a believer out of fellowship. There are many examples where we
readily believe without ever having seen what we believe. For example, you may not
have ever been to Berlin, but it exists, it’s on the map of Germany. Millions
of people live there and even more have visited Berlin. The resurrection has
been attested, the eleven incidents in the 40 days of post-resurrection,
pre-ascension, etc. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Faithlessness</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Thomas’ philosophy was seeing is believing. Divine
viewpoint is believing is seeing. What do you believe? John 20:24-29.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with
them when Jesus came. So the other disciples were saying to him, “We have seen
the Lord!” But he said to them, “Unless I see in His hands the imprint of the
nails, and put my finger into the place of the nails, and put my hand into His
side, I will not believe.” After eight days His disciples were again inside,
and Thomas with them. Jesus came, the doors having been shut, and stood in
their midst and said, “Peace be with you.” Then He said to Thomas, “Reach here
with your finger, and see My hands; and reach here your hand and put it into My
side; and do not be unbelieving, but believing.” Thomas answered and said to
Him, “My Lord and my God!” Jesus said to him, “Because you have seen Me, have
you believed? Blessed are they who did not see, and yet believed.” “  (John
20:24-29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Reverence and Great Joy</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Exactly what was manifested when Christ was born? Luke
2:9-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And an angel of the Lord suddenly stood before them, and the
glory of the Lord shone around them; and they were terribly frightened. But the
angel said to them, “Do not be afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of
great joy which will be for all the people;”  (Luke 2:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This fear or reverence and joy led to worship as when
Christ was born. Matt. 2:10-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great
joy. After coming into the house they saw the Child with Mary His mother; and
they fell to the ground and worshiped Him. Then, opening their treasures, they
presented to Him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.”  (Matthew 2:10-11,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 28:8, they ran and they were enthusiastic
about their message. <span style='color:black'>The solution for the unsaved</span>
is the new birth. The solution for believers is to grow up spiritually and to
serve the Lord, and in doing so to glorify God. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And they left the tomb quickly with fear and great joy and ran
to report it to His disciples.”  (Matthew 28:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Resurrection Appearances of our Lord before His
Ascension</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord appeared to Mary Magdalene. She had more
doctrine in her soul than any other woman in her time. Mark 16:9-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“[Now after He had risen early on the first day of the week, He
first appeared to Mary Magdalene, from whom He had cast out seven demons. She
went and reported to those who had been with Him, while they were mourning and
weeping. When they heard that He was alive and had been seen by her, they
refused to believe it.” (Mark 16:9-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord appeared to the other women and to the two
disciples on the way to Emmaus. Matt. 28:9-10; Mark 16:12-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And behold, Jesus met them and greeted them. And they came up
and took hold of His feet and worshiped Him. Then Jesus said to them, &quot;Do
not be afraid; go and take word to My brethren to leave for Galilee, and there
they will see Me.&quot;” (Matthew 28:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“After that, He appeared in a different form to two of them
while they were walking along on their way to the country. They went away and
reported it to the others, but they did not believe them either.” (Mark
16:12-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ in resurrection body appeared to Simon Peter
and to the disciples although Thomas was absent. Luke 24:13-15; Luke 24:33-35; Mark
16:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And behold, two of them were going that very day to a village
named Emmaus, which was about seven miles from Jerusalem. And they were talking
with each other about all these things which had taken place. While they were
talking and discussing, Jesus Himself approached and began traveling with
them.” (Luke 24:13-15, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“And they got up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem, and
found gathered together the eleven and those who were with them, saying,
&quot;The Lord has really risen and has appeared to Simon.&quot; They began to
relate their experiences on the road and how He was recognized by them in the
breaking of the bread.” (Luke 24:33-35, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Afterward He appeared to the eleven themselves as they were
reclining at the table; and He reproached them for their unbelief and hardness
of heart, because they had not believed those who had seen Him after He had
risen.” (Mark 16:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our Lord appeared to Thomas and the other disciples and
again to the seven disciples by the Sea of Galilee. John 20:26-31; John
21:1-23. </p>

<p class=Verses>“After eight days His disciples were again inside, and Thomas
with them. Jesus came, the doors having been shut, and stood in their midst and
said, &quot;Peace be with you.&quot; Then He said to Thomas, &quot;Reach here
with your finger, and see My hands; and reach here your hand and put it into My
side; and do not be unbelieving, but believing.&quot; Thomas answered and said
to Him, &quot;My Lord and my God!&quot; Jesus said to him, &quot;Because you
have seen Me, have you believed? Blessed are they who did not see, and yet
believed.&quot; Therefore many other signs Jesus also performed in the presence
of the disciples, which are not written in this book; but these have been
written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and
that believing you may have life in His name.” (John 20:26-31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Lord Jesus Christ in resurrection body appeared to James
and to more than 500 people. 1 Cor. 15:6-7. </p>

<p class=Verses>“After that He appeared to more than five hundred brethren at
one time, most of whom remain until now, but some have fallen asleep; then He
appeared to James, then to all the apostles;” (1 Corinthians 15:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ appeared to the 11 disciples when the Great
Commission was given and to the disciples on Mount Olivet prior to His Ascension.
Matt. 28:16-20; Mark 16:19-20; Acts 1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the eleven disciples proceeded to Galilee, to the mountain
which Jesus had designated. When they saw Him, they worshiped Him; but some
were doubtful. And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, &quot;All authority
has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. &quot;Go therefore and make
disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the
Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I commanded you; and
lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.&quot;” (Matthew 28:16-20,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So then, when the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, He was
received up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God. And they went
out and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them, and confirmed the
word by the signs that followed.] [And they promptly reported all these
instructions to Peter and his companions. And after that, Jesus Himself sent
out through them from east to west the sacred and imperishable proclamation of
eternal salvation.]” (Mark 16:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Conclusions</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Isaiah 52:13 refers to Jesus Christ as God’s servant to
execute the Father’s plan for salvation. At the Cross, He provided eternal
life. He also provides the Word and fellowship. Because we are in union with
Him, all believers will have a resurrection body like Him. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Behold, My servant will prosper, He will be high and lifted up
and greatly exalted.”  (Isaiah 52:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The next three phrases in Isaiah 52:13 describe the steps
to glorification of the humanity of Jesus Christ after His death. “He will be
high” means He will rise up in resurrection. “Lifted up” refers to His ascension.
“Greatly exalted” refers to the session of Christ, seated at the right hand of
the throne of the Father. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>During the scourging and beatings of our Lord during His
trials, people were astonished at the degree of physical beating. They wondered
what kept Him going. How was He able to stand up? His face was disfigured
horribly. They beat Him with their fists, but He didn’t hit them back. In
Isaiah 52:14, “His appearance” refers to our Lord’s physical body that was
mangled - they took all the skin off His back. Matt 26:67.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Just as many were astonished at you, My people, So His
appearance was marred more than any man And His form more than the sons of
men.&quot;  (Isaiah 52:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then they spat in His face and beat Him with their fists;
and others slapped Him,&quot;  (Matthew 26:67, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>People will be startled at the Second Advent. When the
King of Kings returns, He will have the stage, front and center. All on earth
will see the Second Advent of Jesus Christ. Isaiah 52:15; Rev. 1:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Thus He will sprinkle many nations, Kings will shut their
mouths on account of Him; For what had not been told them they will see, And
what they had not heard they will understand.&quot;  (Isaiah 52:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“BEHOLD, HE IS COMING WITH THE CLOUDS, and every eye will see
Him, even those who pierced Him; and all the tribes of the earth will mourn
over Him. So it is to be. Amen.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation 1:7, NASB)</p>
