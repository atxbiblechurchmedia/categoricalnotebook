<p class="body">Ralph G. Braun, Th.M. received his academic preparation to use his spiritual gift of pastor-teacher at Dallas Theological Seminary where he earned his degree of Master of Theology. He was ordained in 1960 at Scofield Memorial Church in Dallas, Texas.</p>
<p class="body">Rev. Ralph G. Braun was pastor-teacher of the Berean Fundamental Church in Brookings, Oregon where he conducted a classroom for training believers to spiritual maturity. He conducted at least 14 classes each week for that purpose and for training a large number of men with a communication spiritual gift. Pastor Braun's ability to minister to men with a communication gift led to a fruitful seminary training ministry for many years.</p>
<p class="body">Pastor Braun authored An Old and New Testament Walk-Through the Bible and traveled the U.S. promoting home Bible studies and group participation to learn to think through the Bible. Rev. Braun pastored in ten churches during his ministry from 1951 to 2022.</p>
<p class="body">His life was characterized by his passion for God, his ministry and teaching the Bible doctrine from the original languages. Rev. Braun was called home to be with the Lord in 2022 at the age of 87. During his lifelong ministry, he emphasized the three things that he lived for; his family, teaching the Word of God, and driving cars. Rev. Braun was motivated by Psalms 90:12 which was often on his mind, "So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom."</p>

<p class="body">The Bible doctrine categories in this "Categorical Notebook" were taught from the pulpit of a local church, the Berean Fundamental Church of Brookings, Oregon, on a daily basis under the authority of Ralph G. Braun, Th.M., pastor-teacher. Rev. Braun's ministry and teaching methods incorporated many of the theological concepts and categories of Bible doctrine as taught by Rev. R. B. Thieme, Jr. of Berachah Church, Houston, Texas.</p>
<p class="body">The Bible doctrines contained in this "Categorical Notebook" were originally compiled from 1969 to 1976 with thousands of printed copies distributed widely on a grace basis in three volumes. These three volumes have been recently consolidated into a single electronic "volume" with most Scripture citations incorporating many thousands of full verses.</p>
<p class="body">This Categorical Notebook is an Isagogical, Categorical and Exegetical compilation of many of the doctrines of the Bible. Because the Bible must be interpreted in accordance with the time in which it was written, extensive information has been compiled on categorical biblical interpretation, original languages, textual criticism, analysis of certain books and/or portions of Scripture, and chronological church history.</p>
<p class="body">This Categorical Notebook is the result of Pastor Braun's teaching ministry and is based on Isaiah 28:10, Isaiah 28:13, and 2 Timothy 2:15.</p>
<p class="bible-text">"For He says, 'Order on order, order on order, Line on line, line on line, A little here, a little there.'" (Isaiah 28:10, NASB)</p>
<p class="bible-text">"Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth." (2 Timothy 2:15, NASB)</p>
<p class="bible-text">"And according to the Law, one may almost say, all things are cleansed with blood, and without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness." (Hebrews 9:22, NASB)</p>

<p class="body">It has been my privilege to have been under the teaching ministry of Pastor Ralph Braun while at Austin Bible Church. My formal academic training for pastor-teacher concluded with studies taught by Pastor Braun from 1991-1994 in biblical hermeneutics, the original biblical languages of Greek and Hebrew, systematic theology, and church history. I am thankful to the Lord in providing such a grace teacher as Ralph Braun to complete my preparation. Much of what I have taught in my ministry at Austin Bible Church since 1995, I owe to the teaching of Pastor Ralph Braun.</p>
<p class="body">While this Categorical Notebook and the more than 700 Bible doctrines contained within it represent Pastor Braun's teaching from the pulpit of the Berean Fundamental Church of Brookings, Oregon during the early 1970's, it is based on the Word of God as has been my ministry. It is an example of the timelessness of God's Word.</p>

<p class="heading" onclick="expandSection(this)">Before You Begin Your Bible Study</p>
<div class="content">
<p class="body">As with any Bible study, if you have already accepted Jesus Christ as your personal Savior, you should be sure that you have named your known sins to God the Father per 1 John 1:9. This ensures that God the Holy Spirit will have restored you to fellowship with God as a non-meritorious gift of grace. Now, through the enabling power of the Holy Spirit, you are able to comprehend the teaching of the Word of God.</p>
<p class="bible-text">"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." (1 John 1:9, NASB)</p>
<p class="body">If you are not a believer in the substitutionary spriitual death of Jesus Christ for all of the sins of mankind, the issue for you is not naming your sins. Your issue is whether you will express your positive faith belief in the work of Christ on the Cross. This expression of faith alone in Jesus Christ alone will result in your own eternal life with God. Salvation is the first and most important non-meritorious gift of grace for you.</p>
<p class="bible-text">"He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him." (John 3:36, NASB)</p>
