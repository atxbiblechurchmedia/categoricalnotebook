<h2>Bible Study Priorities Based on Level of Spiritual Growth</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The following are suggested priority doctrines or
categories that the believer should know well as an indicator of their level of
spiritual growth. Understand that knowing these doctrines academically is not
an indicator of your spiritual growth. The Bible doctrine must be believed and

<p class=Verses>“And the testimony is this, that God has given us eternal life,
and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has the life; he who does not

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Doctrines pertaining to the dangers of spiritual babyhood.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Priorities for the Adolescent or Growing Believer</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Angelic Conflict </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Angels are divided into two categories: Unfallen: Holy
and Elect: 1 Tim. 5:21; Mark 8:38, Fallen: Headed by Satan.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ
Jesus and of His chosen angels, to maintain these principles without bias,
doing nothing in a spirit of partiality.” (1 Timothy 5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words in this
adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him
when He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels.&quot;” (Mark
8:38, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Operational (demons) 1 Tim. 4:1, Imprisoned 2 Peter 2:4,
those of Genesis 6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will
fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and doctrines
of demons,” (1 Timothy 4:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast
them into hell and committed them to pits of darkness, reserved for judgment;”
(2 Peter 2:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Fallen angels, plus Satan, are sentenced to the Lake of
Fire. Matt 25:41. This sentence took place in the past.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Then He will also say to those on His left, 'Depart from
Me, accursed ones, into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil
and his angels;” (Matthew 25:41, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan objected to the judgment and, in objecting, he
charged the character of God. “How can a loving God cast His creatures into the
Lake of Fire?” No specific Scripture is worded in this way. Rather, a
Scriptural deduction is made from many, many passages.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan’s negative volition being the pattern for man’s
negative volition. Isaiah 14:12-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;How you have fallen from heaven, O star of the morning,
son of the dawn! You have been cut down to the earth, You who have weakened the
nations! &quot;But you said in your heart, 'I will ascend to heaven; I will
raise my throne above the stars of God, And I will sit on the mount of assembly
In the recesses of the north. 'I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I
will make myself like the Most High.'” (Isaiah 14:12-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To resolve the Angelic Conflict, an inferior creature was
created and placed on one planet - Earth. Heb. 2:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;YOU HAVE MADE HIM FOR A LITTLE WHILE LOWER THAN THE
ANGELS; YOU HAVE CROWNED HIM WITH GLORY AND HONOR, AND HAVE APPOINTED HIM OVER
THE WORKS OF YOUR HANDS;” (Hebrews 2:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Man’s volition is tested under two systems: Before the
fall: in innocence he was ignorant of sin, he had no sin nature. Man had
volition (free will). After the fall: in sinfulness he had an old sin nature
and volition (free will) and a new tree - the Cross. Man could exercise
positive volition--non-meritorious faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Man’s faith in Christ resolves the Angelic Conflict.
Issue: Will mankind (inferior to angels by birth) choose the work of Christ? If
so, this resolves the Angelic Conflict. Heb. 1 and Heb. 2.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ became a man through physical birth (virgin
birth). By birth, Jesus Christ was lower than the angels. Humanity of Christ is
now higher than angels as He sits at the right hand of God. In Christ we are
positionally at the right hand of God; therefore, we are positionally higher
than angels: therefore, we have a servant - a guardian angel. Heb. 1:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“having become as much better than the angels, as He has
inherited a more excellent name than they.” (Hebrews 1:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mankind is under angelic observation. The angels learn
divine judgment of God by watching the human race. Luke 15:7; Luke 15:10; Eph.
3:10, 1 Tim. 5:21; 1 Peter 1:12; 1 Cor. 4:9; 1 Cor.6:3; 1 Cor. 11:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I tell you that in the same way, there will be more joy
in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons
who need no repentance.” (Luke 15:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves,
but you, in these things which now have been announced to you through those who
preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven—things into
which angels long to look.” (1 Peter 1:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore the woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her
head, because of the angels.” (1 Corinthians 11:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Through the fall of man, Satan gained control of this
planet. Faith in Jesus Christ frees man from Satan's domination. 2 Cor. 4:4;
John 12:31; John 14:30; John 16:11; Eph. 2:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“in whose case the god of this world has blinded the minds of
the unbelieving so that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory
of Christ, who is the image of God.” (2 Corinthians 4:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has
been judged.” (John 16:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Military Commitment, Doctrine of Leadership</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>War will always exist in history in spite of man is
efforts for peace. Isaiah 2:4; Micah 4:3; Eccl. 3:8; Matt. 24: 6-7. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And He will judge between the nations, And will render
decisions for many peoples; And they will hammer their swords into plowshares
and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not lift up sword against
nation, And never again will they learn war.” (Isaiah 2:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“A time to love and a time to hate; A time for war and a time
for peace.” (Ecclesiastes 3:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>But war is for adults (over 20 years old). Num. 1:3; Num.
26:2. </p>

<p class=Verses>“from twenty years old and upward, whoever is able to go out to
war in Israel, you and Aaron shall number them by their armies.” (Numbers 1:3,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Take a census of all the congregation of the sons of
Israel from twenty years old and upward, by their fathers' households, whoever
is able to go out to war in Israel.&quot;” (Numbers 26:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The objective of justified war is the annihilation of the
enemy and thus his decisive defeat. This brings peace. Joshua 11:23; Joshua 14:15;
Psalms 46:8-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD
had spoken to Moses, and Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel according
to their divisions by their tribes. Thus the land had rest from war.” (Joshua
11:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now the name of Hebron was formerly Kiriath-arba; for Arba was
the greatest man among the Anakim. Then the land had rest from war.” (Joshua
14:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Justified war is from God. 1 Chron. 5:19-22. </p>

<p class=Verses>“They made war against the Hagrites, Jetur, Naphish and Nodab.
They were helped against them, and the Hagrites and all who were with them were
given into their hand; for they cried out to God in the battle, and He answered
their prayers because they trusted in Him. They took away their cattle: their
50,000 camels, 250,000 sheep, 2,000 donkeys; and 100,000 men. For many fell
slain, because the war was of God. And they settled in their place until the
exile.” (1 Chronicles 5:19-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There comes a time when it is sinful not to go to war.
Num. 32:5ff.</p>

<p class=Verses>“They said, &quot;If we have found favor in your sight, let
this land be given to your servants as a possession; do not take us across the
Jordan.&quot;” (Numbers 32:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“'None of the men who came up from Egypt, from twenty years old
and upward, shall see the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob;
for they did not follow Me fully,” (Numbers 32:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>However, going to war demands training: Num. 31:3-5. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Moses spoke to the people, saying, &quot;Arm men from among
you for the war, that they may go against Midian to execute the LORD'S
vengeance on Midian. &quot;A thousand from each tribe of all the tribes of
Israel you shall send to the war.&quot; So there were furnished from the
thousands of Israel, a thousand from each tribe, twelve thousand armed for
war.” (Numbers 31:3-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>But warfare demands a mental attitude of moral courage
and battle courage. Deut. 20:1-20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;When you go out to battle against your enemies and see
horses and chariots and people more numerous than you, do not be afraid of
them; for the LORD your God, who brought you up from the land of Egypt, is with
you.” (Deuteronomy 20:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer in war. Psalms 27:3-4. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Though a host encamp against me, My heart will not fear;
Though war arise against me, In spite of this I shall be confident. One thing I
have asked from the LORD, that I shall seek: That I may dwell in the house of
the LORD all the days of my life, To behold the beauty of the LORD And to
meditate in His temple.” (Psalms 27:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is important that military leaders have divine
viewpoint minus the mental attitude sins. Prov. 24:1-10. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For by wise guidance you will wage war, And in abundance of
counselors there is victory.” (Proverbs 24:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God prepares believers for training. 2 Sam. 22:35; Psalms
18:34; Psalms 144:1. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;He trains my hands for battle, So that my arms can bend
a bow of bronze.” (2 Samuel 22:35, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“A Psalm of David. Blessed be the LORD, my rock, Who trains my
hands for war, And my fingers for battle;” (Psalms 144:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers are protected in war by God. Job 5:20. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;In famine He will redeem you from death, And in war from
the power of the sword.” (Job 5:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are always those who plot warfare. Psalms 55:20-23;
Psalms 68:30; Psalms 120:6-7; Psalms 140:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Rebuke the beasts in the reeds, The herd of bulls with the
calves of the peoples, Trampling under foot the pieces of silver; He has
scattered the peoples who delight in war.” (Psalms 68:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the choir director. A Psalm of David. Rescue me, O LORD,
from evil men; Preserve me from violent men Who devise evil things in their
hearts; They continually stir up wars.” (Psalms 140:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Peace propaganda is used as a weapon of warfare. Micah
3:5-7. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Thus says the LORD concerning the prophets who lead my people
astray; When they have something to bite with their teeth, They cry,
&quot;Peace,&quot; But against him who puts nothing in their mouths They
declare holy war. Therefore it will be night for you—without vision, And
darkness for you—without divination. The sun will go down on the prophets, And
the day will become dark over them. The seers will be ashamed And the diviners
will be embarrassed. Indeed, they will all cover their mouths Because there is
no answer from God.” (Micah 3:5-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>War is used as a national discipline. Judges 5:8; 2 Chron.
16:9; Isaiah 16:3-26; Jer. 4:19-31.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;New gods were chosen; Then war was in the gates. Not a
shield or a spear was seen Among forty thousand in Israel.” (Judges 5:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For the eyes of the LORD move to and fro throughout the
earth that He may strongly support those whose heart is completely His. You
have acted foolishly in this. Indeed, from now on you will surely have
wars.&quot;” (2 Chronicles 16:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>War is used as personal discipline. Job 10:1; Job 10:17. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I loathe my own life; I will give full vent to my
complaint; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.” (Job 10:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“'You renew Your witnesses against me And increase Your anger
toward me; Hardship after hardship is with me.” (Job 10:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The misnomer of war. Matt. 26:52.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Jesus said to him, &quot;Put your sword back into its
place; for all those who take up the sword shall perish by the sword.” (Matthew
26:52, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching,
for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; so that the man of
God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.” (2 Timothy 3:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mental Attitudes (Control of thought life) and
Application, Thought life Control, Communications, Negative communication:
Gossip, maligning, badmouthing.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Emotional Revolt</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Suffering - Six circumstances under which the human race
suffers: Health, People, Privation, Weather, Mental, Justice.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Categories of suffering in time:  The Person of Jesus
Christ: suffering on the Cross. The unbeliever: to awaken to his need of the
Lord Jesus. The believer: (19 reasons why he suffers).</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b><u>Nineteen Reasons Why Believers Suffer </u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1.  Suffering caused by the details of life: Ecclesiastes.
With scar tissue on the soul, everything you touch turns to misery. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>2.  Suffering from guilt reaction to sin and the
suppression of the sin in the self-conscious. 1 Tim. 1:5-6; 1 Tim. 1:19-20; 1
Tim. 3:9. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But the goal of our instruction is love from a pure heart and
a good conscience and a sincere faith. For some men, straying from these
things, have turned aside to fruitless discussion,” (1 Timothy 1:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“keeping faith and a good conscience, which some have rejected
and suffered shipwreck in regard to their faith. Among these are Hymenaeus and
Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan, so that they will be taught not to
blaspheme.” (1 Timothy 1:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“but holding to the mystery of the faith with a clear
conscience.” (1 Timothy 3:9, NASB)</p>
