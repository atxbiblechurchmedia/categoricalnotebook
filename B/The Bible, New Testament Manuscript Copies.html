<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Chester Beatty Papyri</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One of the greatest discoveries of new Biblical
manuscripts. One of the eight oldest manuscripts. Date: Biblical manuscripts
are with one exception 2nd and 3rd centuries AD. Publicly made known by Chester
Beatty, Nov, 19, 1931. It falls into three codices: The Gospels and Acts:
contains 60 pages. 200-250 AD, Pauline Epistles: 172 pages. 3rd century, and
Book of Revelation: Chap. 9:10-17:2; 20 pages. 3rd century.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The “Greek Bible”</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Of the seven great uncial manuscripts described, four of
them - the Sinaitic, Vatican, Alexandrian and the Ephraem, contain or did
contain the entire Greek New Testament. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>King James Version</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Of these oldest and important manuscripts, only two--Beza
and Claromontanus, were known and accessible at the time when the King James
Version of our English Bible was made in 1611 and they were not used to any
great extent. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Minuscule Manuscripts</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Manuscripts written in small letters. Date: 8th century
and onward. Number of Manuscripts: Highest number counted was 2,352. Lake says,
“about 3,000.” Of these 46 contain the entire New Testament, others have
sections. Value: Even though the minuscules came later in time, some of them
were copies of older uncials. Therefore, a later minuscule might carry an older
text than a given uncial. There are several of real value, of these the
following: No. 1, 118, 111, 209, 81. Minuscules are listed in the apparatus by number,
Uncials by letter.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Papyri</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Single sheets or fragments of sheets, upon which parts of
the Bible are written in Greek. Discoveries:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1778 - Papyrus
found in Europe </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1820 - Papyrus
found dating to 2nd century </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1877 - Papyrus
first discovered on large scale by Arsinoe</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1890 -
systematic exploration started under Professor Petrie </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1896-7 - Drs.
Grenfell and Hunt of Oxford, England found tons of papyri, ranging in age from
1st century to the 10<sup>th</sup> century. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1925 -
Robertson listed 34 fragments, 19 of which were found in Egypt. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>By 1940 - the number has increased to 52. Most are dated
to 3rd through 6th or 7th century. Value of the Papyri: Age - 200 years or more
older than oldest known vellum manuscripts. They represent 12 New Testament
books, confirm their authenticity. Vocabulary: they throw much light on the
meaning of New Testament words. They reduce the supposed 550 “new words” of the
New Testament to 50.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Summary</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are about 170 Uncials.  There are about 2,352
Minuscules. There are about 52 Papyri. There are 1565 Lectionaries. This makes
a total of 4,139 manuscripts, with more being discovered. We have 8,000
manuscripts of the Latin Vulgate and 1,000 manuscripts of ancient versions.</p>
