<h2>Biblical Knowledge</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is omniscient. He knows all that is knowable. The
Word of God is from the Father. The Bible is the mind of Christ. The Bible is
also the voice of the Holy Spirit. Heb. 4:12; 1 Cor. 2:16; Heb. 3:7. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any
two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of
both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the
heart.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT
HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, just as the Holy Spirit says, “TODAY IF YOU HEAR
HIS VOICE,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 3:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Biblical knowledge provides guidance to the believer. Biblical
knowledge provides stability. This spiritual knowledge results from the Holy
Spirit taking the believed <i>gnosis</i> doctrine from the left lobe of the
soul into the right lobe of the soul as <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine. There
it begins to build the edification complex of the soul. Application of <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine results in divine wisdom. This is the grace apparatus for
perception. It’s all grace. Isaiah 33:6. See category on <a
href="#_Divine_Guidance">Divine Guidance</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He will be the stability of your times, A wealth of
salvation, wisdom and knowledge; The fear of the LORD is his treasure.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah
33:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>Paul’s prayer for those he had
never seen was for each believer to build an edification complex in their soul
which results in divine wisdom, spiritual knowledge and spiritual understanding.
Paul does not pray for them to have an emotional experience, prosperity,
ecstatics, good health, etc. Col. 1:9-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason also, since the day we heard of it, we have
not ceased to pray for you and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge
of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding, so that you will walk in
a manner worthy of the Lord, to please Him in all respects, bearing fruit in
every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Colossians
1:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Biblical knowledge brings confidence. Bible doctrine
taught by your pastor-teacher is transferred by the Holy Spirit to the human
spirit based on your positive volition toward what was heard. Here, the
spiritually understood phenomena is cycled to the left lobe of the soul by the
Holy Spirit as <i>gnosis</i> or understood spiritual knowledge. With positive
faith belief in that <i>gnosis</i> doctrine, the Holy Spirit transfers it to
the right lobe of the soul as <i>epignosis</i> or full spiritual knowledge. It
is now applicable to life’s situations when filled with the Holy Spirit.
Consistent learning of Bible doctrine and its application brings spiritual
growth – the erection of the edification complex of the soul. This brings
confidence of our salvation. 1 John 2:3; John 3:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“By this we know that we have come to know Him, if we keep His
commandments.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 John 2:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And everyone who has this hope fixed on Him purifies himself,
just as He is pure.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 John 3:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If we keep His commandments or doctrines, it’s because we
are filled with the Holy Spirit and equipped to stay in fellowship. This
confidence results in the believer being able to claim God's promises of Romans
8:28, 1 Thessalonians 5:18, and Job 24:1. God is omniscient and omnipotent. Times
are not hidden from God.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And we know that God causes all things to work together for
good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
8:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“in everything give thanks; for this is God’s will for you in
Christ Jesus.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Thessalonians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““Why are times not stored up by the Almighty, And why do those
who know Him not see His days?”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Job 24:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>How do we gain biblical knowledge? By rightly dividing
the Word of Truth. In Isaiah 28:9-10, “Order on order” refers to Bible doctrine
categories. “Line on line” refers to verse by verse study. “A little here, a
little there” means the believer should have some study every day. 2 Tim. 2:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>““To whom would He teach knowledge, And to whom would He
interpret the message? Those just weaned from milk? Those just taken from the
breast? “For He says, ‘Order on order, order on order, Line on line, line on
line, A little here, a little there.’““&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah 28:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman
who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2
Timothy 2:15, NASB)</p>
