<h2><a name="_D-Balaam"></a><a name="_Balaam"></a>Balaam </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Balaam was a Gentile believer who’s cursing of the
regenerate Jews within the nation of Israel was frustrated by God. King Balak
hired Balaam to curse the Jews. Instead of Balaam cursing the Jews, the Holy
Spirit came upon him and what came out of his mouth prophesied the glorious  future
of Israel during the Millennium. King Balak figured he had been cheated. Num.
24:2; Num. 24:5-8; Num. 24:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And Balaam lifted up his eyes and saw Israel camping tribe by
tribe; and the Spirit of God came upon him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Numbers 24:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“How fair are your tents, O Jacob, Your dwellings, O Israel! “Like
valleys that stretch out, Like gardens beside the river, Like aloes planted by
the LORD, Like cedars beside the waters. “Water will flow from his buckets, And
his seed will be by many waters, And his king shall be higher than Agag, And
his kingdom shall be exalted. “God brings him out of Egypt, He is for him like
the horns of the wild ox. He will devour the nations who are his adversaries,
And will crush their bones in pieces, And shatter them with his arrows.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Numbers
24:5-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Balak’s anger burned against Balaam, and he struck his
hands together; and Balak said to Balaam, “I called you to curse my enemies,
but behold, you have persisted in blessing them these three times!”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Numbers
24:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Balaam's lust for money caused him to find another way to
get the Jews into spiritual trouble when he discovered that God would not allow
him to curse Israel. Balaam advised Balak, King of Moab, to neutralize Israel
by getting them out of fellowship on a large scale by bringing thousands of beautiful
women into the country from Moab who had been instructed to lure the Jewish
males into sexual encounters in any way they could. His idea was to cause the
born-again Jews to be defeated by appealing to their sexual lust pattern from
their old sin natures. Num. 24:16-23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The oracle of him who hears the words of God, And knows the
knowledge of the Most High, Who sees the vision of the Almighty, Falling down,
yet having his eyes uncovered. “I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not
near; A star shall come forth from Jacob, A scepter shall rise from Israel, And
shall crush through the forehead of Moab, And tear down all the sons of Sheth. “Edom
shall be a possession, Seir, its enemies, also will be a possession, While
Israel performs valiantly. “One from Jacob shall have dominion, And will
destroy the remnant from the city.” And he looked at Amalek and took up his
discourse and said, “Amalek was the first of the nations, But his end shall be
destruction.” And he looked at the Kenite, and took up his discourse and said, “Your
dwelling place is enduring, And your nest is set in the cliff. “Nevertheless
Kain will be consumed; How long will Asshur keep you captive?” Then he took up
his discourse and said, “Alas, who can live except God has ordained it?”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Numbers
24:16-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When Balaam and Balak parted company, Balaam had earned
his fee, but not by cursing the Jews, but by corrupting the Jews. Num. 24:25; Num.
25:1-3; Num. 31:16-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Balaam arose and departed and returned to his place, and
Balak also went his way.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Numbers 24:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“While Israel remained at Shittim, the people began to play the
harlot with the daughters of Moab. For they invited the people to the
sacrifices of their gods, and the people ate and bowed down to their gods. So
Israel joined themselves to Baal of Peor, and the LORD was angry against
Israel.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Numbers 25:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““Behold, these caused the sons of Israel, through the counsel
of Balaam, to trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor, so the plague
was among the congregation of the LORD. “Now therefore, kill every male among
the little ones, and kill every woman who has known man intimately. “But all
the girls who have not known man intimately, spare for yourselves.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Numbers
31:16-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The doctrine of Balaam gives the principle of
neutralizing believers by getting them out of fellowship, thus separating them
from the source of divine power - the filling of the Holy Spirit. The doctrine
of Balaam is any system of works whereby believers get out of fellowship and
stay out of fellowship which eventuates in spiritual retrogression.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Reasons Balaam Was a Believer </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Balaam not only knew the Lord Jesus Christ, but confessed
the Lord in the presence of King Balak and the messengers from Moab. He also
asked the Lord’s will and to some extent followed it. He eventually went in
direct opposition to the Lord’s will. Num. 22:8; Num. 22:13; Num. 22:18-19; Num.
22:38; Num. 23:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He said to them, “Spend the night here, and I will bring word
back to you as the LORD may speak to me.” And the leaders of Moab stayed with
Balaam.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Numbers 22:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So Balaam arose in the morning and said to Balak’s leaders, “Go
back to your land, for the LORD has refused to let me go with you.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Numbers
22:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Balaam replied to the servants of Balak, “Though Balak were to
give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not do anything, either
small or great, contrary to the command of the LORD my God. “Now please, you
also stay here tonight, and I will find out what else the LORD will speak to
me.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Numbers 22:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So Balaam said to Balak, “Behold, I have come now to you! Am I
able to speak anything at all? The word that God puts in my mouth, that I shall
speak.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Numbers 22:38, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He replied, “Must I not be careful to speak what the LORD puts
in my mouth?”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Numbers 23:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Initially, Balaam would not leave Pethor without the Lord’s
permission. Numbers 22:20 also teaches the principle of the direct will of God.
This “prophet for hire” had a lust for riches, but being a believer, he was
under restraint at this point.</p>

<p class=Verses>“God came to Balaam at night and said to him, “If the men have
come to call you, rise up and go with them; but only the word which I speak to
you shall you do.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Numbers 22:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Lord Jesus Christ met Balaam and conversed with
Balaam along the way. Numbers 22:22 relates to us the principle of the
permissive will of God. This point is not conclusive in itself, but strengthens
our argument for Balaam being a believer. In the Bible, God does not generally
converse with unbelievers, only believers.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But God was angry because he was going, and the angel of the
LORD took his stand in the way as an adversary against him. Now he was riding
on his donkey and his two servants were with him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Numbers 22:22,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Lord puts words in the mouth of Balaam when he tried
to curse Israel - the opposite words that Balaam intended. Num. 23:5; Num. 23:12;
Num. 23:16. These passages give us the principle of the overruling will of God.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD put a word in Balaam’s mouth and said, “Return
to Balak, and you shall speak thus.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Numbers 23:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He replied, “Must I not be careful to speak what the LORD puts
in my mouth?”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Numbers 23:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD met Balaam and put a word in his mouth and said,
“Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Numbers 23:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Balaam called Jehovah “his God.” This denotes a salvation
relationship with the Lord. Num. 22:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Balaam replied to the servants of Balak, “Though Balak were to
give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not do anything, either
small or great, contrary to the command of the LORD my God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Numbers
22:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Holy Spirit came upon Balaam in Numbers 24:2. This
passage gives us the principle of the sovereign ministry of the temporary
enduement of the Holy Spirit to Old Testament believers. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And Balaam lifted up his eyes and saw Israel camping tribe by
tribe; and the Spirit of God came upon him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Numbers 24:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Peter 2:15-16, Balaam is referred to as a prophet.</p>

<p class=Verses>“forsaking the right way, they have gone astray, having
followed the way of Balaam, the son of Beor, who loved the wages of
unrighteousness; but he received a rebuke for his own transgression, for a mute
donkey, speaking with a voice of a man, restrained the madness of the prophet.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2
Peter 2:15-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Numbers 31:8, Balaam dies the Sin Unto Death.
Generally, the Scripture only records believers dying the Sin Unto Death. This
is maximum divine discipline to the retrogressive believer. </p>

<p class=Verses>“They killed the kings of Midian along with the rest of their
slain: Evi and Rekem and Zur and Hur and Reba, the five kings of Midian; they
also killed Balaam the son of Beor with the sword.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Numbers 31:8,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The New Testament parallel to Balaam is “Simon Magus, the
Sorcerer.” Simon was a believer and was in reversionism. Acts 8:13; Acts 8:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Even Simon himself believed; and after being baptized, he
continued on with Philip, and as he observed signs and great miracles taking
place, he was constantly amazed.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 8:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““You have no part or portion in this matter, for your heart is
not right before God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 8:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Balaamism in the New Testament</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The “way of Balaam” is where the apostate believer
becomes psychopathic and/or psychotic. 2 Peter 2:15-18. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;forsaking the right way, they have gone astray, having
followed the way of Balaam, the son of Beor, who loved the wages of
unrighteousness; but he received a rebuke for his own transgression, for a mute
donkey, speaking with a voice of a man, restrained the madness of the prophet.
These are springs without water and mists driven by a storm, for whom the black
darkness has been reserved. For speaking out arrogant words of vanity they
entice by fleshly desires, by sensuality, those who barely escape from the ones
who live in error,&quot;  (2 Peter 2:15-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The “error of Balaam” refers to the believer under the
frantic search for happiness and enslaved to the details of life. This
enslavement causes him to think human viewpoint instead of divine viewpoint. Jude
1:2; Jude 1:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;May mercy and peace and love be multiplied to you.&quot; 
(Jude 1:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Woe to them! For they have gone the way of Cain, and for
pay they have rushed headlong into the error of Balaam, and perished in the
rebellion of Korah.&quot;  (Jude 1:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The “teaching of Balaam” refers to the frantic search for
happiness through sexual immorality. Rev. 2:14-15 </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; 'But I have a few things against you, because you have
there some who hold the teaching of Balaam, who kept teaching Balak to put a
stumbling block before the sons of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols
and to commit acts of immorality. 'So you also have some who in the same way
hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans. &quot;  (Revelation 2:14-15, NASB)</p>
