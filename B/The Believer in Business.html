<h2>The Believer in Business </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The vast majority of believers today are in business of
one type or another, either from the standpoint of management or labor. Where
you work is part of your full time Christian service. In the business world,
the believer may face such adversity that you are not as successful as you
expected, so you may feel defeated and a failure that results in a guilt
complex. You may be too proud to admit it! </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>But there is an answer. There is a way back. There is
recovery, but you’ve got to believe. It never depends on you. It depends upon
who and what God is. Phil. 2:12-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in
my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with
fear and trembling; for it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to
work for His good pleasure. Do all things without grumbling or disputing;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Philippians
2:12-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Probably no one today is more a realist than the
Christian with Bible doctrine and the grace-given ability to apply the Word of
God to experience. A man or woman, a young person who knows they are born-again
and who has grown in grace will be a stalwart in the crisis and will have been
alerted to historical tragedies that are applicable to the times in which we
live. They will have biblical principles and live by them until they are called
home to be with the Lord. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Economy of a Nation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We know from the Word of God that the economy of a nation
is based on the perceived or real confidence in the economy of the country and
its associated money and exchange rates with other nations’ currencies. The
economy of a nation is also based on the mental attitude of its people. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The stock market ebbs and flows based on the mental
attitude of the traders involved each day. If the traders’ mental attitudes are
controlled more by emotions than facts, the markets can fluctuate more wildly.
If the stock traders are not careful to check what they see and hear to
corroborate what is fact versus fiction, the markets will trend accordingly. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In addition, the economy of a nation is based on the population’s
respect for authority. To the extent that the population does not respect
authority, they will choose to not adhere to the Divine Institutions (Volition,
Marriage, Family, and Nationalism) and to the written laws of that country. To
the extent that a country’s populace does not respect and adhere to the Divine
Institutions, they turn away from God. To the extent that a populace turns away
from God, divine discipline of the nation will be administered by the justice
of God accordingly. The ultimate extension of this increasing divine discipline
can end with the Fifth Cycle of Discipline. Romans 1:18-25. See the category on
the <a href="#_Divine_Discipline,_The">Five Cycles of Divine Discipline</a>. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all
ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in
unrighteousness, because that which is known about God is evident within them;
for God made it evident to them. For since the creation of the world His
invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly
seen, being understood through what has been made, so that they are without
excuse. For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give
thanks, but they became futile in their speculations, and their foolish heart
was darkened. Professing to be wise, they became fools, and exchanged the glory
of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man and of
birds and four-footed animals and crawling creatures. Therefore God gave them
over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, so that their bodies would be
dishonored among them. For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and
worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed
forever. Amen.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 1:18-25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The economy of a nation is also based on the hard work of
its population. A society can carry only so many lazy and irresponsible people
who have no initiative. The stability of a nation is based upon the four divine
institutions and a police and judicial system to enforce those divine
institutions. A military establishment is designed to protect the nation from
external enemies and to protect the nation’s property and territories. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The nation also depends on unbelievers having the
freedoms to freely chose for or against the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal
Savior. Believers must also have the freedom to learn Bible doctrine, to learn
the Word of God so they can apply it to experience.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Carnal Christian </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Romans 7 talks about the carnal Christian which is a
believer out of fellowship. This is any believer whether missionary, pastor,
evangelist, businessman, officer, coach, or teacher. In Romans 7:6, “newness of
the Spirit” is the Holy Spirit teaching the human spirit of the believer.
“Oldness of the letter” is the Mosaic Law, which should not be a way of life
for the believer in the Church Age. The Church Age believer’s spiritual life is
based on the filling of the Holy Spirit and application of Bible doctrine. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But now we have been released from the Law, having died to
that by which we were bound, so that we serve in newness of the Spirit and not
in oldness of the letter.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 7:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 7:11, “killed me” refers to spiritual defeat
and discouragement. </p>

<p class=Verses>“for sin, taking an opportunity through the commandment,
deceived me and through it killed me.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 7:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 7:14, “I am of flesh” refers to being dominated
by the old sin nature resulting in mental attitude sins such as temper,
irritability, and chip on the shoulder resulting in overt sins such as foul
language and nasty behavior toward others.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For we know that the Law is spiritual, but I am of flesh, sold
into bondage to sin.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 7:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The carnal Christian is unable to do what they want to
do. They are unable to control their life, sin dominates them, so they are
defeated. The carnal Christian is failure by their own measurements. They
develop an inferiority complex and can vary between nice and nasty toward
others. They become unstable with successive ups and downs. They can be too
proud to acknowledge that the Lord is the answer. They will be unable to
perform. Rom. 7:15; Rom. 7:18; Rom. 7:24. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For what I am doing, I do not understand; for I am not
practicing what I would like to do, but I am doing the very thing I hate.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
7:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my
flesh; for the willing is present in me, but the doing of the good is not.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
7:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Wretched man that I am! Who will set me free from the body of
this death?”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 7:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Answer For the Carnal Christian</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>We are commanded to stop being in
a state of carnality. How do you accomplish that? First, by confession of sin
using 1 John 1:9. This puts you into fellowship and filled with the Holy
Spirit. You will remain in fellowship by repeating confession of sin, as
necessary. You should go on a crash program of daily Bible doctrine intake to
get the scar tissue out of your soul. Eph. 4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&quot;  (1 John
1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Get to a local church where the Word is communicated by a
pastor-teacher. Comprehend the facts of God’s Word in the human spirit by means
of the enabling power of the Holy Spirit. Your positive faith belief in that <i>gnosis</i>
Bible doctrine results in the Holy Spirit transferring the <i>gnosis</i> Bible
doctrine into the right lobe of the soul as <i>epignosis</i>. There, you can apply
that Bible doctrine to the situations you encounter every day. Eph. 3:18-19; Eph.
4:23. </p>

<p class=Verses> “may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the
breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ which
surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians
3:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses> “and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians
4:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Learning Bible doctrine through the grace apparatus for
perception results in the building of the edification complex of the soul. Eph.
4:12; Eph. 4:15-16. </p>

<p class=Verses>“for the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to
the building up of the body of Christ;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all
aspects into Him who is the head, even Christ, from whom the whole body, being
fitted and held together by what every joint supplies, according to the proper
working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building
up of itself in love.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 4:15-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Principles for the Christian in Business</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Although the Bible is filled with principles for the
Christian businessman, very little public teaching is done from pertinent
passages on the subject. 1 Timothy 6 presents biblical principles for the
Christian in business. If you are all fouled up and not taking in the Word
categorically, you’ll have good times and bad times, but you will gradually hit
lower and lower points. The workaday world is divided into two categories, labor
and management. In business, the chain of command must be recognized. 1 Tim.
6:1-2. </p>

<p class=Verses>“All who are under the yoke as slaves are to regard their own
masters as worthy of all honor so that the name of God and our doctrine will
not be spoken against. Those who have believers as their masters must not be
disrespectful to them because they are brethren, but must serve them all the
more, because those who partake of the benefit are believers and beloved. Teach
and preach these principles.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Timothy 6:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Hard work (mentally and physically) is the oil of success
in the business world. For the believer, they must remain in fellowship. Long
hours at work can be defeating if they cut you out of Bible study. Gen. 3:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“By the sweat of your face You will eat bread, Till you return
to the ground, Because from it you were taken; For you are dust, And to dust
you shall return.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis 3:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The boss should not exploit their employees. Nor should
their employees disrespect them. 1 Tim. 6:2. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Those who have believers as their masters must not be
disrespectful to them because they are brethren, but must serve them all the
more, because those who partake of the benefit are believers and beloved. Teach
and preach these principles.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Timothy 6:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer is to represent God in their business or
where they work. You represent God in your area of work full time just as the
pastor-teacher does for his local church. 1 Tim. 6:3. </p>

<p class=Verses>“If anyone advocates a different doctrine and does not agree
with sound words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ, and with the doctrine
conforming to godliness,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Timothy 6:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Dishonesty in business destroys your testimony as a
believer. This doesn’t mean just stealing material or money. It means stealing
through a rotten mental attitude. It means stealing through lack of a full day’s
work. It means stealing by knifing your employer in the back. 1 Tim. 6:4-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“he is conceited and understands nothing; but he has a morbid
interest in controversial questions and disputes about words, out of which
arise envy, strife, abusive language, evil suspicions, and constant friction
between men of depraved mind and deprived of the truth, who suppose that
godliness is a means of gain.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Timothy 6:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ephesians 4:28, “He who steals” is a present active
participle. The believer with scar tissue operates under mental attitude sins
and is a slave to the details of life. A believer with scar tissue will have
materialism lust. In the darkness of their soul, they seek to gain money to
gratify their lust pattern. Removal of scar tissue changes the pattern of
dishonesty in business. As the scar tissue is removed, the edification complex
is erected.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He who steals must steal no longer; but rather he must labor,
performing with his own hands what is good, so that he will have something to
share with one who has need.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 4:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Erecting an edification complex changes the behavior
pattern of business procedure. Since the believer in business is in full time
Christian service, they must conduct that business as unto the Lord. The full
time Christian service demands honesty in business practice, otherwise, there
is a loss of testimony. The edification complex stabilizes the believer in
business. It reflects the glory of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The oil that makes business run as smoothly as possible
is godliness, linked with contentment! What is Godliness?  Godliness is the
fruit of the Spirit. 1 Tim. 6:6; Gal. 5:22-23. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But godliness actually is a means of great gain when
accompanied by contentment.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Timothy 6:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience,
kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things
there is no law.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Galatians 5:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Godliness is the character of Christ formed within you.
Godliness is reflecting the glory of God. What is contentment? It is a relaxed
mental attitude, a spiritual peace, stability and poise. It is the result of
true biblical godliness. Gal. 4:19; 1 Cor. 6:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“My children, with whom I am again in labor until Christ is
formed in you—”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Galatians 4:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For you have been bought with a price: therefore glorify God
in your body.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 6:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The mental attitude of employees and employers should be
that food and clothing purchased from wages of hard work is enough for
contentment. 1 Tim. 6:7-8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For we have brought nothing into the world, so we cannot take
anything out of it either. If we have food and covering, with these we shall be
content.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Timothy 6:7-8, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If a believer in business (employee or employer) has
inner spiritual stability, their outward needs will be very simple. 1 Tim. 6:9-10.
</p>

<p class=Verses>“But those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a
snare and many foolish and harmful desires which plunge men into ruin and
destruction. For the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil, and some by
longing for it have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with
many griefs.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Timothy 6:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Your mental attitude toward money is an indicator of
spiritual stability or the lack of it. In what do you find your security? Your
mental attitude toward money should be that it is only a detail of life. Only spiritual
growth and ultimately an edification complex in the right lobe of your soul can
give you the stability to master money. Money must not be the passion of your
life. 1 Tim. 6:9-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a
snare and many foolish and harmful desires which plunge men into ruin and
destruction. For the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil, and some by
longing for it have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with
many griefs.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Timothy 6:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Money in the Bible, as nearly anything, can be used in a
good sense and in a bad sense. How many of you really believe that money is the
root is all evil? I hope no one. 1 Timothy 6:10 says the “love of money is the
root of all sorts of evil.” It can become the basis for different categories of
evil like lying, cheating, and lusting. The pursuit of money in believers can drown
out Bible doctrine as the criterion for success.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil, and
some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves
with many griefs.&quot;  (1 Timothy 6:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Some by longing for it” means a habitual lust for money,
to grasp after, to live for money, to make money be the center of all
motivation. There are times when all of us wish we had more money. We’re talking
about believers here. “Wandered away from the faith” means they depart from the
faith, the whole counsel of God. They bypass Bible doctrine not intentionally
at first, but they get too busy for the Word of God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Pierced themselves” means they literally stick pins in
themselves. It is possible to love money so much that you stick yourself with
the pins of “many griefs.”  What is the solution to this? Throw all your money
away and give it to Christian charities? No. The solution is to get oriented with
regard to money. The problem is the mental attitude toward money as the highest
criterion for success. It should be Bible doctrine and a soul filled with <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine. Money does many wonderful things and can be a real blessing if
properly obtained. This is a mental attitude toward money in a good sense.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A believer in business will ultimately need a crash
program of daily intake of Bible doctrine to hold their own in the business
world. Do you need a crash program of Bible doctrine to correct your thinking
and behavior at work? It’s the ultimate answer. 1 Timothy 6:11-12 is your
answer. How about You? How is your full time Christian work going? 2 Tim. 2:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But flee from these things, you man of God, and pursue
righteousness, godliness, faith, love, perseverance and gentleness. Fight the
good fight of faith; take hold of the eternal life to which you were called,
and you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Timothy 6:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman
who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2
Timothy 2:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 Timothy 6:11-12, “flee” is the present imperative of <span
lang=EL>φευ</span>́<span lang=EL>γω</span> (pheugō) and means to flee the lust
of love for money, flee dishonest business practices, exploiting employees, and
loafing on the job. How? “Pursue righteousness” refers to divine good
production through the filling of the Spirit. Gal. 5:22-23. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,
patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against
such things there is no law.&quot;  (Galatians 5:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divine good production in only through the application of
the Word of God to experience. Divine good production relies on the epignosis
Bible doctrine residing in the edification complex of the soul. Titus 3; Eph.
4. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Timothy 6:11-12, “fight” means to be properly
oriented with regard to money. We know that “the battle is the Lord’s,” so let
Him fight so money won’t overpower you, whether you do or don’t have it. “Fight
the good fight of faith” means to know the whole counsel of God. It means to understand
your salvation in its relationship to the old sin nature, how the Word is learned,
what scar tissue is, and understand the Angelic Conflict and your role in it. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Take hold” means to utilize the spiritual grace
resources of the Word of God. It means to grab ahold of the edification complex
that is produced by the learning of Bible doctrine like the world clutches
after their money. It is saying, “Don’t grab hold of inanimate objects such as
money, but grab hold of spiritual things with eternal consequences. Whether you
have money or don’t have it, if you carry your happiness with you, you won’t be
disturbed.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Christian in business is in full time Christian
service. They are just as much servants of the Lord as any minister or
missionary.</p>
