<h2>The Believer’s Production</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Production is first seen in the book of Galatians with
the Apostle Paul evangelizing. The fruit of production in evangelizing is the
salvation of souls. This is viewed by many today as the greatest part of the
production of the believer. However, this is a false concept.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Production follows adequate preparation. Galatians 1
depicts Paul as thoroughly prepared before he began his evangelizing ministry
besides the further ministry of teaching and edifying. The production of a
believer is the source of blessing to other believers who may only hear about
it. Gal. 1:24.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And they were glorifying God because of me.&quot; 
(Galatians 1:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The production of a believer is directly related to their
spiritual gift and being in the right niche. Gal. 2. This is based on the
concept of Paul vindicating the spiritual gift that he had with his production
and that with the Gentiles. Production will vary at different levels of
spiritual gift development. In Galatians 1, we find Paul evangelizing. In
Galatians 2, we find him trouble-shooting a problem. In Galatians 3, we find
him doing much teaching and explaining. The book of Galatians itself is the production
of writing the text of Scripture itself.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Production is not dependent upon reputation. The
production of the believer is not a result of some human good system of works
or programs. It is by the principle of grace and faith. Gal. 2; Gal. 3:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So then, does He who provides you with the Spirit and
works miracles among you, do it by the works of the Law, or by hearing with faith?&quot; 
(Galatians 3:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In production, the believer often has to curtail their
liberty so that it will not rise up and overthrow the very thing that they are
trying to accomplish. This is operation of the law of supreme sacrifice. Gal.
5:13. See category on <a href="#_D-Laws_for_Doubtful">Laws for Doubtful Things</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For you were called to freedom, brethren; only do not
turn your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one
another.&quot;  (Galatians 5:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One of the hazards of the believer in production is the
temptation to keep operating out of fellowship rather than getting back into
fellowship or stopping until they do. This is particularly true today because
of the countless number of men in the ministry who do not understand and
believe the principle of 1 John 1:9 and confessing sin biblically.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&quot;  (1 John
1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Galatians, two types of production stand out. First,
the production of the old sin nature called the works of the flesh, and
secondly, the production of the Spirit called the fruit of the Spirit. The
production of the fruit of the Spirit is the result of the filling of the
Spirit. The production of the believer in fellowship is a result of the
spiritual gift capacity. Gal. 5:17-23.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit, and the
Spirit against the flesh; for these are in opposition to one another, so that
you may not do the things that you please. But if you are led by the Spirit,
you are not under the Law. Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are:
immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife,
jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions, envying,
drunkenness, carousing, and things like these, of which I forewarn you, just as
I have forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the
kingdom of God. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience,
kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things
there is no law.&quot;  (Galatians 5:17-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul does not make the production of the Galatian
believers in their spiritual gift capacity an issue because their problem
centered with the production of the Spirit. Legalism is the enemy of the
filling of the Spirit. It is foolish to talk about production of the spiritual
gift unless there is production of the fruit of the Spirit. A believer cannot
have spiritual gift production without the filling of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>However, a believer can have filling of the Spirit
without having spiritual gift production. Spiritual gift production depends not
only on the filling of the Spirit, but also upon proper motivation, doctrinal
content in their soul, spiritual growth and maturity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are general factors of spiritual production common
to all believers and then specific functions that relate to believers with
certain spiritual gifts. In Galatians 6:2-10, we have some of the general
functions of production common to all believers. However, there are certain
production factors that relate to specific communication and leadership gifts.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Bear one another’s burdens, and thereby fulfill the law
of Christ. For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives
himself. But each one must examine his own work, and then he will have reason
for boasting in regard to himself alone, and not in regard to another. For each
one will bear his own load. The one who is taught the word is to share all good
things with the one who teaches him. Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for
whatever a man sows, this he will also reap. For the one who sows to his own
flesh will from the flesh reap corruption, but the one who sows to the Spirit
will from the Spirit reap eternal life. Let us not lose heart in doing good,
for in due time we will reap if we do not grow weary. So then, while we have opportunity,
let us do good to all people, and especially to those who are of the household
of the faith.&quot;  (Galatians 6:2-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher in his proper spiritual gift
production is worthy of support from those who prosper from his ministry. In
Galatians 6:6, “share” is κοινωνέω (koinōneō) and means to come into
communion or fellowship with, to become a sharer, be made a partner. This has
to do with the matter of responsible sharing of financial needs. Continued
production requires patience and endurance and there will be the harvest.
Production is always a natural function of a supernatural capacity and ability.
Production is never or should never be a forced function. Gal. 6:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Let us not lose heart in doing good, for in due time we will
reap if we do not grow weary.” (Galatians 6:9, NASB)</p>
