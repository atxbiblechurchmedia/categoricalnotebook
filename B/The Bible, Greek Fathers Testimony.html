<h2>The Bible, Greek Fathers Testimony</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Apostolic Fathers: (50-100 AD)</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some of the Apostolic Fathers are listed below.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Clement of Rome: 30-100 AD. Wrote the Epistle to the
Corinthian church called “First Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians in 96 AD.
He cites references to the books of Matthew, Luke, Acts, Romans, 1 Corinthians,
Ephesians, Thessalonians, Timothy, Titus, Hebrews, James, and Peter. This is
translated in full in “The Ante-Nicene Fathers,” Vol. 1, pp. 5-21.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ignatius of Antioch: 30-107 AD. Tradition says he was a
disciple of the Apostle John. At Smyrna, he wrote four letters to the
Ephesians, Magensians, Trallians, and Romans. At Troas, he wrote three letters
to the Philadelphians, Smyrnaians, and to Polycarp. He refers to all 13
Epistles and uses Matthew, John and possibly Luke.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Polycarp: 69-155 AD. He became the Bishop of the Church
of Smyrna, possibly the one of Revelation 2 &amp; 3. He had an interesting
death. He was to be burned. He was bound and placed on the pile of wood. The
wood was ignited, wind caused it to form an arc over his body. The executioner
ordered him to be pierced with a dagger. This was done and blood gushed out and
extinguished the fire. The fire was rebuilt and consumed the lifeless body. His
Writings: He wrote a number of letters. Only one is left, the Epistle to the
Philippians. The epistle came to us in Greek and Latin. It is translated in
English in “The Ante-Nicene Fathers,” Vol. 1, pages 31-36. This epistle
contains about 50 quotations from Matthew, Luke, John, Acts, 1 Peter and 10 of
Paul’s Epistles.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Didache, also known as The Teaching of the Lord to
the Gentiles by the Twelve Apostles, or The Teaching of the (Twelve) Apostles
is basically a handbook or manual of Christian ethical instruction and church
order (Holmes, Dictionary of the Later New Testament and Its Developments, p.
301).</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Epistle of Barnabas is an early second century
document concerned with showing that Christians are the true heirs of God’s
covenant. Its author remains anonymous.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Shepherd of Hermas was a popular document in the 2nd
and 3rd centuries. It’s significance rests in that it sheds light on the
Christian situation at Rome in the mid-2nd century. The author(s) is unknown.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Ante-Nicene Fathers: 150-325 AD</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some of the Ante-Nicene Fathers are listed below.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Justin Martyr: 100-165 AD. He uses the teachings of
Jesus. Alludes to passages in Romans, 1 Corinthians, Ephesians, Colossians and
mentions Revelation. Patron saint of philosophers in the Roman Catholic Church.
Justin identified the concept of the Son of God as the life-giving Word that
implants truth in the minds of all people. He also identified Christ as “The
New Adam” and Mary as “The New Eve” in whom creation is made new - while Adam
and Eve precipitate the fall of man by eating from a tree, Christ regenerates
man by dying on one. This concept would prove important for later writers.
Justin was executed in the reign of Marcus Aurelius after refusing to sacrifice
to the pagan gods. He was scourged and beheaded, earning the surname Martyr.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Irenaeus: 120-192 AD. He was a Polemist: a defender
against heresy. He wrote five books refuting Gnosticism; we have some in Greek
fragments, all in Latin. He referred to the entire New Testament, first writer
to do so, some 1,800 quotations and references. Quotes 1,000 times from the
Gospels. The theology of Irenaeus was one of the single most important
contributions to what would become orthodox Christianity in the future.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Clement of Alexandria: 150-217 AD. He was trained in
Greek literature and its systems of philosophy. Became a believer, then pastor
in Alexandria. At 190 AD, he became president of the first Bible and Missionary
Training Institute in Alexandria. His writings: “Exhortations to the Heathen,”
was Evangelistic. “The Pedagogus, or Instructor,” was 3 books on Christian
Morality and Living. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Stromata,” seven books covering history, poetry,
philosophy, Christian truth and pagan error. He quotes from the New Testament
more than 2,400 times and every book except Philemon and James and 2 Peter are
used. He quotes the Gospels over 1,000 times.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Origen: 185 – 254 AD. Origen was one of the most
significant early apologists of the Christian faith. He was an important
theologian who had a large influence on the development of eastern
Christianity, though he would be the subject of persistent attacks as he was
allegedly ordained a priest illegitimately. Origen believed in the concept of
universal salvation (including the future salvation of Satan). Origen’s
importance lies in two primary areas - in Biblical interpretation, he pioneered
the concept of the three-fold interpretation of Scripture: literal, ethical,
and spiritual. By literal is meant the face meaning of the words on the text;
ethical means what the text teaches about the relation of man to man and man to
God; by spiritual is meant the inner, divine meaning. All three levels exist
simultaneously in the text. In Christology, Origen presented the idea that the
Father is “more divine” than the Son. This has been perceived as the origin of
the heresy of Arianism, and Origen himself was condemned as a heretic for this
view.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Tertullian B: 160 - 225 AD. A controversial theologian
widely considered the founder of western, Latin Christian theology, Tertullian
was originally a pagan who converted to Christianity. Tertullian was a major
opponent of the heresy of Marcionism, and was the first to work out a systematic
doctrine of the Trinity. He was a significant proponent of purism in that he
rejected any attempts to make Christian theology dependent on external sources
such as Academic philosophy, leading him to argue the principle of sufficiency
of Scripture. Ironically, Tertullian became closely associated with the heresy
of Montanism later in life.</p>
