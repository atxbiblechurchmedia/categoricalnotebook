<h2><a name="_The_Growing_Believer"></a>The Growing Believer</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Growing Believer Positive to Bible Doctrine</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Happy Believer</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 3:13, the word “blessed” is <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>אשׁר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> ('esher) and means happiness, blessed. The happy believer also
finds wisdom. You cannot separate happiness from the Word of God. This is inner
and outer happiness. The happy believer has maximum inner happiness, which
gives them the capacity for maximum outer happiness. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;How blessed is the man who finds wisdom And the man who
gains understanding.&quot;  (Proverbs 3:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The happy believer takes in Bible doctrine daily. Prov.
8:34.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Blessed is the man who listens to me, Watching
daily at my gates, Waiting at my doorposts.&quot;  (Proverbs 8:34, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The happy believer has the grace capacity of showing
mercy. Prov. 14:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He who despises his neighbor sins, But happy is he who is
gracious to the poor.&quot;  (Proverbs 14:21, NASB)</p>

find it difficult to exercise the proper respect for those in authority. Prov.
28:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;How blessed is the man who fears always, But he who
hardens his heart will fall into calamity.&quot;  (Proverbs 28:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Prudent Believer</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 12:16, the word “prudent” is <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>ערוּם</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> (‛ârûm) and means a prudent believer covers shame. They know
how and when to keep their mouth shut. The prudent believer has reserve and a
relaxed mental attitude under pressure.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;A fool's anger is known at once, But a prudent man
conceals dishonor.&quot;  (Proverbs 12:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A prudent believer conceals knowledge when it is not
productive or helpful to the situation.  Prov. 12:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;A prudent man conceals knowledge, But the heart of fools
proclaims folly.&quot;  (Proverbs 12:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A prudent believer deals with knowledge or Bible
doctrine, which is their life. Prov. 13:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Every prudent man acts with knowledge, But a fool
displays folly.&quot;  (Proverbs 13:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A prudent believer is not fooled or gullible or stupid.
Prov. 14:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The naive believes everything, But the sensible man
considers his steps.&quot;  (Proverbs 14:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A prudent believer brings a recognition of <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine to others. Prov. 14:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The naive inherit foolishness, But the sensible are
crowned with knowledge.&quot;  (Proverbs 14:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A prudent believer foresees evil coming, but fools do
not. Prov. 22:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The prudent sees the evil and hides himself, But the
naive go on, and are punished for it.&quot;  (Proverbs 22:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A prudent believer protects themselves from evil. Prov.
27:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;A prudent man sees evil and hides himself, The naive
proceed and pay the penalty.&quot;  (Proverbs 27:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Diligent Believer</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The diligent believer will bring prosperity. In Proverbs
10:4, the word “diligent” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>חָרוּץ</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (charuts) and means sharp or diligent. The
diligent believer has grace orientation to God, themselves, life, and people.
The diligent believer has mastery of the details of life. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Poor is he who works with a negligent hand, But the hand
of the diligent makes rich.&quot;  (Proverbs 10:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The diligent believer has the capability and discipline
to rule. A believer who is not diligent will be unable to rule. Their indolence
will destroy the motivations of others and their own accomplishments. Prov.
12:24.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The hand of the diligent will rule, But the slack hand
will be put to forced labor.&quot;  (Proverbs 12:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The diligent believer has a proper appreciation for what
they have accomplished or the fruit of their labor. Prov. 12:27.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;A lazy man does not roast his prey, But the precious
possession of a man is diligence.&quot;  (Proverbs 12:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The diligent believer will have proper motivation in life
and therefore, accomplish in proportion making their soul “fat” and successful.
Prov. 13:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The soul of the sluggard craves and gets nothing, But the
soul of the diligent is made fat.&quot;  (Proverbs 13:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The diligent believer is thorough in their thought
processes and this leads to prosperity. They do not follow haste as a way to
succeed. Prov. 21:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The plans of the diligent lead surely to advantage, But
everyone who is hasty comes surely to poverty.&quot;  (Proverbs 21:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The diligent believer when consistent will rise to the
top. Prov. 22:29.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Do you see a man skilled in his work? He will stand
before kings; He will not stand before obscure men.&quot;  (Proverbs 22:29,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Understanding Believer</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An understanding believer knows the value of learning Bible
doctrine and gains a capacity for life. In Proverbs 1:5, the word
“understanding” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>בּין</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (bı̂yn) and means to discern, to get
understanding.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;A wise man will hear and increase in learning, And a man
of understanding will acquire wise counsel,&quot;  (Proverbs 1:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An understanding believer knows how to use their learning
(divine wisdom). In Proverbs 10:23, the word “understanding” is<span dir=RTL></span><span
dir=RTL><span dir=RTL></span> </span><span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>תּבוּנה</span><span lang=HE dir=RTL> </span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span>(tebûnâh) and means discretion, wisdom, understanding.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Doing wickedness is like sport to a fool, And so is
wisdom to a man of understanding.&quot;  (Proverbs 10:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An understanding believer is slow to anger and is
levelheaded. Prov. 14:29.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He who is slow to anger has great understanding, But he
who is quick-tempered exalts folly.&quot;  (Proverbs 14:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An understanding believer is sound in moral and ethical
stability. Prov. 15:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Folly is joy to him who lacks sense, But a man of
understanding walks straight.&quot;  (Proverbs 15:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An understanding believer does not have a sour grapes
mental attitude, is not moody, but has an excellent spirit and a properly
tempered disposition. Prov. 17:27.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He who restrains his words has knowledge, And he who has
a cool spirit is a man of understanding.&quot;  (Proverbs 17:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An understanding believer knows how and when to keep
their mouth shut. They are not a motor mouth and doesn’t claim to have all the
answers. Prov. 17:28.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Even a fool, when he keeps silent, is considered wise;
When he closes his lips, he is considered prudent.&quot;  (Proverbs 17:28,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An understanding believer is able to use the resources
from the soul of another believer. Prov. 20:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;A plan in the heart of a man is like deep water, But a
man of understanding draws it out.&quot;  (Proverbs 20:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An understanding believer brings stability to their
community and nation and rides out the storms of either. Prov. 28:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;By the transgression of a land many are its princes, But
by a man of understanding and knowledge, so it endures.&quot;  (Proverbs 28:2,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Righteous Believer</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 10:3, “righteous” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>צדּיק</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> (tsaddı̂yq) and means to be just, lawful, righteous. The soul
of the righteous believer will never be thirsty.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The LORD will not allow the righteous to hunger, But He
will reject the craving of the wicked.&quot;  (Proverbs 10:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The mouth of the righteous believer will have something
to say because they know Bible doctrine and their soul is a well of water.
Prov. 10:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, But the
mouth of the wicked conceals violence.&quot;  (Proverbs 10:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The communication of the righteous believer is a great
benefit to many. Prov. 10:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The lips of the righteous feed many, But fools die for
lack of understanding.&quot;  (Proverbs 10:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The content of the speech of the righteous believer is
correct and approved by the Lord. Prov. 10:32.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The lips of the righteous bring forth what is acceptable,
But the mouth of the wicked what is perverted.&quot;  (Proverbs 10:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The labor of the righteous believer brings out life and
perpetuates it. Prov. 10:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The wages of the righteous is life, The income of the
wicked, punishment.&quot;  (Proverbs 10:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The desires of the righteous believer will be granted.
Prov. 10:24.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;What the wicked fears will come upon him, But the desire
of the righteous will be granted.&quot;  (Proverbs 10:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The righteous believer is a constant stability in life.
Prov. 10:25; Prov. 10:30.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When the whirlwind passes, the wicked is no more, But the
righteous has an everlasting foundation.&quot;  (Proverbs 10:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The righteous will never be shaken, But the wicked will
not dwell in the land.&quot;  (Proverbs 10:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The righteous believer is delivered out of and through
their pressures. Prov. 11:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The righteous is delivered from trouble, But the wicked
takes his place.&quot;  (Proverbs 11:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The prosperity of the righteous believer brings happiness
to their city. Prov. 11:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When it goes well with the righteous, the city rejoices,
And when the wicked perish, there is joyful shouting.&quot;  (Proverbs 11:10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The righteous believer has the promise that their
descendants will be spared many of the pressures of life because of their
faithfulness. Prov. 11:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Assuredly, the evil man will not go unpunished, But the
descendants of the righteous will be delivered.&quot;  (Proverbs 11:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A righteous believer has an appreciation for the sources
of their sustainment. Prov. 12:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;A righteous man has regard for the life of his animal,
But even the compassion of the wicked is cruel.&quot;  (Proverbs 12:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Growing Believer Who has Become Negative to Bible
Doctrine</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Evil Believer</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 2:12, the word for evil is <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>רַע</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(ra) in the Hebrew and means bad in a
disagreeable, unpleasant, and displeasing sense. Vicious of disposition. A real
pain-in-the-neck type.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For wisdom will enter your heart And knowledge will be
pleasant to your soul; Discretion will guard you, Understanding will watch over
you, To deliver you from the way of evil, From the man who speaks perverse
things; From those who leave the paths of uprightness To walk in the ways of
darkness; Who delight in doing evil And rejoice in the perversity of evil;
Whose paths are crooked, And who are devious in their ways;&quot;  (Proverbs
2:10-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The evil believer is extremely verbal and speaks
“perverse things” and deviates from the truth. They are willingly obstinate in
speech and also verbally cranky. The evil believer deviates from the straight
moral course of normal life. They are weak on the divine institutions and are unstable.
Prov. 2:13. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;An evil man is ensnared by the transgression of his lips,
But the righteous will escape from trouble.&quot;  (Proverbs 12:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The evil believer is devious and despises the spiritual
believer who is taking the normal course in the spiritual life. Prov. 14:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He who walks in his uprightness fears the LORD, But he
who is devious in his ways despises Him.&quot;  (Proverbs 14:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The evil believer pursues heavily traveled ways of sin. They
are sucked in by the normal ways of darkness. 1 Cor. 3:1-3. In Proverbs 2:13,
they walk in “ways of darkness.” </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual
men, but as to men of flesh, as to infants in Christ. I gave you milk to drink,
not solid food; for you were not yet able to receive it. Indeed, even now you
are not yet able, for you are still fleshly. For since there is jealousy and
strife among you, are you not fleshly, and are you not walking like mere
men?&quot;  (1 Corinthians 3:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;From those who leave the paths of uprightness To walk in
the ways of darkness;&quot;  (Proverbs 2:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The evil believer enjoys their sins and perversity of
evil. The evil believer has lots of kinks and hang-ups and distorts the normal
path of life. The evil believer’s path of life leads them farther from the
truth. Prov. 2:14-15.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Who delight in doing evil And rejoice in the perversity
of evil; Whose paths are crooked, And who are devious in their ways;&quot; 
(Proverbs 2:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The evil believer practices bitterness, hates his job,
women, his car, just anything that seems to get in his way. Prov. 17:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;A rebellious man seeks only evil, So a cruel messenger
will be sent against him.&quot;  (Proverbs 17:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 4:14-15, the righteous believer is warned
about the evil believer. How does the righteous believer remain grace-oriented when
they are around this type of person? They are to avoid their pathway of life,
to separate from them.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Do not enter the path of the wicked And do not proceed in
the way of evil men. Avoid it, do not pass by it; Turn away from it and pass
on.&quot;  (Proverbs 4:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The evil believer is said to have a “net.” Evil believers
have devices in their arsenal to catch things. The believer who is evil, who
has nets or machinery in which they function, are to be observed carefully and
held in wariness. Prov. 12:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The wicked man desires the booty of evil men, But the
root of the righteous yields fruit. &quot;  (Proverbs 12:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The evil believer will have to succumb to divine judgment
ultimately. Prov. 14:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The evil will bow down before the good, And the wicked at
the gates of the righteous.&quot;  (Proverbs 14:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The evil believer is not to be envied or accompanied. One
must realize that they seem to have fun or success, but it will all crumble
under the just hand of God. Prov. 24:1. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Do not be envious of evil men, Nor desire to be with
them;&quot;  (Proverbs 24:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Wicked Believer</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 5:22, the Hebrew word for “wicked” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>רשׁע</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(râshâ‛) and means morally wrong,
criminal, wicked. This is one guilty of a crime, deserving punishment or
discipline. This is a carnal believer who is under divine discipline and will
be tied up by their own sins.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;His own iniquities will capture the wicked, And he will
be held with the cords of his sin.&quot;  (Proverbs 5:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The wicked believer is tied up by their own sins and will
repulse shamefully someone who rebukes them for their sin. They are more
aggressive and will cut you to pieces when you reprove them. Prov. 9:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He who corrects a scoffer gets dishonor for himself, And
he who reproves a wicked man gets insults for himself.&quot;  (Proverbs 9:7,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Wicked believers act disgustingly and shamefully. They
are loathsome. Prov. 13:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;A righteous man hates falsehood, But a wicked man acts
disgustingly and shamefully.&quot;  (Proverbs 13:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The life of the wicked believer ends without realizing their
dreams and expectations. At the end of their life there is nothing. Prov. 11:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When a wicked man dies, his expectation will perish, And
the hope of strong men perishes.&quot;  (Proverbs 11:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>How does the wicked believer make it through life? They bear
gifts or peace offerings to distort any judgment toward them. The word used
here was used to bribe a judge to throw a case. They buy what they get with
money, acts of kindness, gifts, etc. and expect return favors. Prov. 17:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;A wicked man receives a bribe from the bosom To pervert
the ways of justice.&quot;  (Proverbs 17:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The wicked believer puts on a bold face or front. They
will look you right in the eye and smile. They will face you anytime cocky and
sure, but on the inside they are all wound up. Prov. 21:29.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;A wicked man displays a bold face, But as for the
upright, he makes his way sure.&quot;  (Proverbs 21:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The wicked believer lurks to bring ruin to the righteous
under the guise of straightening someone out. Prov. 24:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Do not lie in wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of
the righteous; Do not destroy his resting place;&quot;  (Proverbs 24:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They are troublesome believers. Prov. 6:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;A worthless person, a wicked man, Is the one who walks
with a perverse mouth,&quot;  (Proverbs 6:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Foolish Believer</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 14:7, the Hebrew word for “fool” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>כּסיל</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(kesı̂yl) and means stupid man, foolish,
dullard. The foolish believer will reveal their stupidity in their speech. In
the spiritual sense, you are able to observe stupidity when it is there. This
stupidity of speech is revealed by the speech having no content. No content of
Bible doctrine or human knowledge. They are grown up as a human being, but with
an immature brain and no maturity. When the foolish believer is recognized, they
are to be abandoned for all they can do is bore you. They can contribute
nothing good to you. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Leave the presence of a fool, Or you will not discern
words of knowledge.&quot;  (Proverbs 14:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The foolish believer has no capacity to handle the
details of life such as money, sex, pleasure, job, health, status symbols, etc.
They squander extravagantly what they have. This is an expression of deficiency
in handling material things. They waste that which is communicated to them by a
mature person. Their treasure and oil are wasted. Prov. 21:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;There is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the
wise, But a foolish man swallows it up.&quot;  (Proverbs 21:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Wandering Believer</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 7:25, the Hebrew word for “stray” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>תּעה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(tâ‛âh). In Psalms 107:4, it is the word
for “wander” and means to be led astray, to physically wander about. The
wandering believer is one who follows up their wandering mental attitudes by
physically and overtly going astray. Prov. 7:25.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways, Do not
stray into her paths.&quot;  (Proverbs 7:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;They wandered in the wilderness in a desert region; They
did not find a way to an inhabited city.&quot;  (Psalms 107:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The same word is “stagger” in Isaiah 28:7 and means to
wander about as one who is intoxicated.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And these also reel with wine and stagger from strong
drink: The priest and the prophet reel with strong drink, They are confused by
wine, they stagger from strong drink; They reel while having visions, They
totter when rendering judgment.&quot;  (Isaiah 28:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It means to ethically go astray to ruin. Prov. 14:22,
Prov. 21:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Will they not go astray who devise evil? But kindness and
truth will be to those who devise good.&quot;  (Proverbs 14:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;A man who wanders from the way of understanding Will rest
in the assembly of the dead.&quot;  (Proverbs 21:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The wandering believer is one who refuses or ignores
reproof. Prov. 10:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He is on the path of life who heeds instruction, But he
who ignores reproof goes astray.&quot;  (Proverbs 10:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The wandering believer devises evil. Prov. 14:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Will they not go astray who devise evil? But kindness and
truth will be to those who devise good.&quot;  (Proverbs 14:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The wandering believer who departs from the realm of
doctrine and the flock will remain hopeless in the realm of the dead, dead to
spiritual blessing. Prov. 21:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;A man who wanders from the way of understanding Will rest
in the assembly of the dead.&quot;  (Proverbs 21:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Violent Believer</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 28:17, the Hebrew word for “laden” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>עשׁק</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(‛âshaq) and means to do violence, to
violate, to oppress. The violent believer practices extortion, deals
tyrannically, oppresses a nation, and is to be burdened with the blood of a
person. The violent believer’s oppression of others will drive them to fleeing.
Their own running will lead them to an early grave.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;A man who is laden with the guilt of human blood Will be
a fugitive until death; let no one support him.&quot;  (Proverbs 28:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Hazards of The Growing Believer</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For the growing believer, there are hazards seen and
unseen, some produced by themselves, some produced by their growth, and some by
the reaction of others to them.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is the hazard of hatred. This is a test for the
grace-oriented believer.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is the hazard of an accusation of legalism. This is
where a diligent believer is accused of legalism. Their evident self-discipline
in the mastery of the details of life can be read by the non-doctrinal believer
as a system of legalism, a threat to freedom, a danger to society, an
infringement on the wellbeing or lawful pursuit of others.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is the hazard of making others uneasy. The growing believer,
when around others, has a relaxed mental attitude and often makes others
uneasy. They are calm when they are vituperative, relaxed when they are raging,
reserved when they are running someone down. Their unruffled composure first
challenges them, convicts them, rebukes them, then provokes in them the
question, “What goes with this person? Are they some sort of nut or maybe not a
real man or real woman?” Uneasiness often results.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is the hazard of specialization. The understanding believer
is well balanced and has capacity for life. This is the believer who has
something to give another believer. They also have the capacity of drawing the
best from others. With this broad balance, those of less spiritual stature in
the circle of believers may feel the need to find something that they do or
have done that is better than the well-balanced or spiritually mature believer.
So they go to their specialty. They single out some detail about themselves
that to them seems to outweigh all of the well-balanced believer’s capacities.
They are more loving, more generous, more courteous, more congenial, more
spiritual, less harsh, less dogmatic, more open minded, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is the hazard of jealousy. The happy believer with
contentment of soul finds often that their happiness or contentment become the
object of another’s jealousy. They are accused of being a phony, unrealistic,
covering their true problems, etc. The content believer’s true capacity of
inner happiness gives them the ability to have happiness externally, whether they
have money or not, pleasures or not, friends or not, status symbols, prestige,
or the many other things the non-doctrinal believer can rely on for the regular
diet of outer happiness.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Growing Believer Has Much To Learn </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The growing believer must be taught Bible doctrine
consistently. To do that, they must orient to the authority of a pastor-teacher
where they are willing to go and be taught. In this manner they can learn
divine wisdom from the Word of God. Proverbs 1:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;To know wisdom and instruction, To discern the sayings of
understanding,&quot;  (Proverbs 1:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher teaches in an academically disciplined
manner. The teaching of Bible doctrine is one-way and results in gaining <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the soul. This includes divine wisdom,
discernment, grace-oriented behavior, what is justice, equity, etc. The growing
believer learnes the thinking of Jesus Christ through the enabling power of the
Holy Spirit. Proverbs 1:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;To receive instruction in wise behavior, Righteousness,
justice and equity;&quot;  (Proverbs 1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Word of God teaches them subtilty, knowledge, and
discretion. In Proverbs 1:4, “prudence” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL>ערמה</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(‛ormâh) and means
wise as a fox in a good sense, subtilty, wisdom. Discretion is <span lang=HE
dir=RTL>מזמּה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(mezimmâh)
and means sagacity, being smarter than the children of darkness.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;To give prudence to the naive, To the youth knowledge and
discretion, A wise man will hear and increase in learning, And a man of
understanding will acquire wise counsel,&quot;  (Proverbs 1:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The growing believer is weak in application of Bible
doctrine and weak in setting priorities in life. The desire to consistently
learn Bible doctrine is a direct measure of spiritual maturity. Proverbs 1:6-7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;To understand a proverb and a figure, The words of the
wise and their riddles. The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge;
Fools despise wisdom and instruction.&quot;  (Proverbs 1:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The growing believer is weak in authority orientation for
instruction and building for a happy future. They should focus on what they
were taught by their parents which is a measure of their authority orientation
and humility as a believer. Proverbs 1:8-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Hear, my son, your father's instruction And do not
forsake your mother's teaching; Indeed, they are a graceful wreath to your head
And ornaments about your neck.&quot;  (Proverbs 1:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Call of Divine Wisdom </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are five places where Bible doctrine was taught in
the ancient world.  In Proverbs 1:20-21, divine wisdom is the one speaking. “In
the street” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL>חוּץ</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> (chûts) and means outdoors. In Ruth 2:4, Boaz taught Bible
class in a harvest field.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem and said to the
reapers, &quot;May the LORD be with you.&quot; And they said to him, &quot;May
the LORD bless you.&quot;&quot;  (Ruth 2:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“In the square” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL>רחב</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(rechôb) and means
the chief place of concourse, the market place. The “noisy streets” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL>המה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>(hâmâh) and means where there is great noise and commotion - the
busiest part of the city. The “entrance of the gates” is where the
administrators of the city could be found, the elders, the big wheels, the
establishment types. This was the inner core of the city.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Wisdom shouts in the street, She lifts her voice in the
square; At the head of the noisy streets she cries out; At the entrance of the
gates in the city she utters her sayings:&quot;  (Proverbs 1:20-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Reproof of Bible Doctrine </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 29:15, the teenager is “a child who gets his
own way” and who no longer responds to their parents’ authority and discipline.
</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The rod and reproof give wisdom, But a child who gets his
own way brings shame to his mother.&quot;  (Proverbs 29:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 1:23, “reproof” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>תּוֹכַחַת</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(tokachath) and is the Hebrew word for
correction, chastisement, and is used 12 times in Proverbs. Bible doctrine is a
reproof to “naïve ones” <span lang=HE dir=RTL>פֶּתִי</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(pethi) and means openly seducible, simple-minded,
foolish, stupid. This word is used 14 times in Proverbs.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Bible doctrine is a reproof to scoffers or <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>לִיץ</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> (lits) and means scorners, mockers, scoffers. This word occurs 10
times in Proverbs. These are the ones who delight themselves in derision of
others, making fun of with a vengeance. Bible doctrine is a reproof to fools or
<span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>כּסיל</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(kesı̂yl) and means a
dullard, fat dumb and happy, stupid, silly about life.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;How long, O naive ones, will you love being
simple-minded? And scoffers delight themselves in scoffing And fools hate
knowledge? &quot;Turn to my reproof, Behold, I will pour out my spirit on you;
I will make my words known to you.&quot;  (Proverbs 1:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Refusal of Doctrine</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Bible doctrine cannot be disregarded without resulting
self-induced misery and divine discipline.  Proverbs 1:24-25, Proverbs 1:26-27.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Because I called and you refused, I stretched out
my hand and no one paid attention; And you neglected all my counsel And did not
want my reproof;&quot;  (Proverbs 1:24-25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I will also laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your
dread comes, When your dread comes like a storm And your calamity comes like a
whirlwind, When distress and anguish come upon you.&quot;  (Proverbs 1:26-27,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Negative volition to Bible doctrine will result in divine
discipline from God. Divine discipline is meant to get the believer to confess
their sins and return to fellowship with God and to return to the intake and
application of Bible doctrine. Prov. 1:28-32, Prov. 29:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Then they will call on me, but I will not answer;
They will seek me diligently but they will not find me, Because they hated
knowledge And did not choose the fear of the LORD. &quot;They would not accept
my counsel, They spurned all my reproof. &quot;So they shall eat of the fruit
of their own way And be satiated with their own devices. &quot;For the
waywardness of the naive will kill them, And the complacency of fools will
destroy them.&quot;  (Proverbs 1:28-32, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;A man who hardens his neck after much reproof Will
suddenly be broken beyond remedy.&quot;  (Proverbs 29:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Response to Enticement </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer’s reply to enticement from evil doers is to
say no – do not consent. In Proverbs 10-14, the word “entice” is <span lang=HE
dir=RTL>פָּתָה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(pathah)
in the Hebrew and means to open, to be roomy, to be persuadable. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;My son, if sinners entice you, Do not consent. If they
say, &quot;Come with us, Let us lie in wait for blood, Let us ambush the
innocent without cause; Let us swallow them alive like Sheol, Even whole, as
those who go down to the pit; We will find all kinds of precious wealth, We
will fill our houses with spoil; Throw in your lot with us, We shall all have
one purse,&quot;&quot;  (Proverbs 1:10-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer is also to separate from those that are
negative to Bible doctrine or who oppose those who are positive to Bible
doctrine. Prov. 1:15-16. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;My son, do not walk in the way with them. Keep your feet
from their path, For their feet run to evil And they hasten to shed
blood.&quot;  (Proverbs 1:15-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The intent of enticement is to destroy your soul. Prov.
1:17-19. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Indeed, it is useless to spread the baited net In the
sight of any bird; But they lie in wait for their own blood; They ambush their
own lives. So are the ways of everyone who gains by violence; It takes away the
life of its possessors.&quot;  (Proverbs 1:17-19, NASB)</p>
