<h2><a name="_D-Baptism_of_the_1"></a>Baptism of the Holy Spirit</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Baptism of the Holy Spirit is one of seven salvation
ministries of God the Holy Spirit where the Holy Spirit enters the Church Age
believer into union with Christ at the moment of salvation, making the Church
Age believer a part of the Body of Christ. This ministry of the Holy Spirit is
an actual identification – a real baptism. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Baptism of the Holy Spirit is not an experience, it
engenders no emotional reaction, it causes no human feelings and it does not
increase. It is perfect and cannot be lost or undone or cancelled by either God
or the believer. There is absolutely nothing that can be done by anyone to lose
your union with Jesus Christ. It is permanent because God the Holy Spirit is
perfect and is unchangeable (immutable). The Baptism of the Holy Spirit is one
the 40 things that every Church Age believer receives at salvation. See
category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/S/The%2040%20Things%20Received%20at%20Salvation.html">The 40 Things Received at Salvation</a>. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Baptism of the Holy Spirit is not the function of any
spiritual gift, as alleged by the Pentecostals, which equate the Baptism of the
Holy Spirit with speaking in tongues. It is not a post-salvation experience. It
is not the ‘second blessing” as asserted by Pentecostals. No one has
legitimately spoken in tongues since 70 AD.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Baptism of the Holy Spirit is the only means of
forming the Body of Christ, (also called the Church and the Bride of Christ)
during the Church Age and teaches identification with Christ in His death,
burial, and resurrection. Rom. 6:3-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized
into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death? Therefore we have been
buried with Him through baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from
the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of
life. For if we have become united with Him in the likeness of His death,
certainly we shall also be in the likeness of His resurrection,&quot;  (Romans
6:3-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This union with Christ is also called Positional
Sanctification or the sanctification of the body. Eph. 5:25-27. See category on
<a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/S/Sanctification.html">Sanctification</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the
church and gave Himself up for her, so that He might sanctify her, having
cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, that He might present to
Himself the church in all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle or any such
thing; but that she would be holy and blameless.&quot;  (Ephesians 5:25-27,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Baptism of the Holy Spirit happened for the first
time on the Day of Pentecost. 1 Cor. 12:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether
Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one
Spirit.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 12:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The unification of believers is dependent upon the Baptism
of the Holy Spirit and only occurs at the moment of salvation. The implications
of the Baptism of the Holy Spirit are given in Galatians 3:26-28. The Baptism
of the Holy Spirit removes all social, racial, or economic distinctions and is
open to all that choose to believe. It does not distinguish one believer from
another, nor does it make one believer superior or inferior to another.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. For
all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.
There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is
neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Galatians
3:26-28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The principle of retroactive identification is brought
out in Romans 6:4-5 and Colossians 2:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore we have been buried with Him through baptism
into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the
Father, so we too might walk in newness of life. For if we have become united
with Him in the likeness of His death, certainly we shall also be in the
likeness of His resurrection,&quot;  (Romans 6:4-5, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“having been buried with Him in baptism, in which you were also
raised up with Him through faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the
dead.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Colossians 2:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Baptism of the Holy Spirit began at the start of the
Church Age and is a sign of the beginning of the Church Age. Matthew 16:18,
Acts 2:3-4. Acts 11:15-17 and John 14:16-20 are key passages and say the Baptism
of the Holy Spirit first took place on the Day of Pentecost. John’s baptisms in
Acts 1:5 identified with the Jewish Age.</p>

<p class=Verses>““I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I
will build My church; and the gates of Hades will not overpower it.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew
16:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with
the Holy Spirit not many days from now.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 1:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And there appeared to them tongues as of fire distributing
themselves, and they rested on each one of them. And they were all filled with
the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit was giving
them utterance.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 2:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them just
as He did upon us at the beginning. “And I remembered the word of the Lord, how
He used to say, ‘John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the
Holy Spirit.’ “Therefore if God gave to them the same gift as He gave to us
also after believing in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could stand in
God’s way?”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 11:15-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another
Helper, that He may be with you forever; that is the Spirit of truth, whom the
world cannot receive, because it does not see Him or know Him, but you know Him
because He abides with you and will be in you. &quot;I will not leave you as
orphans; I will come to you. &quot;After a little while the world will no
longer see Me, but you will see Me; because I live, you will live also.
&quot;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in
you.&quot;  (John 14:16-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 2:3-4, the Baptism of the Holy Spirit occurred
first in Jerusalem and included the gift of tongues to warn the Jews of the
coming fifth cycle of discipline which would actually occur in 70 AD.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 14:16-20, “he may be with you forever” refers to
the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. “The world” refers to the unbeliever. “He
abides with you and will be in you” also refers to the indwelling of the Holy
Spirit. “In that day” is the Day of Pentecost. “You in Me” refers to Baptism of
the Holy Spirit and resultant Positional Sanctification and “I in you” refers
to the indwelling of Jesus Christ in every Church Age believer as the Shekinah
Glory. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Baptism of the Holy Spirit is the basis for
Positional Truth. Eph. 1:3-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ,
just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be
holy and blameless before Him. In love He predestined us to adoption as sons
through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will,
to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely bestowed on us in the
Beloved.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 1:3-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Baptism of the Holy Spirit is not an experience. It
is not speaking in tongues or ecstatics. The Baptism of the Holy Spirit enters
every believer into union with Jesus Christ and thus, are all made members of
the Body of Christ. 1 Cor. 12:13; Col. 1:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether
Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one
Spirit.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 12:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He is also head of the body, the church; and He is the
beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that He Himself will come to have
first place in everything.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Colossians 1:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The aorist tense of 1 Corinthians 12:13 means the action
is once and for all, plus the phrase “we were all” means all who believe, not
just some. In salvation, our volition is involved only in our decision to
accept Jesus Christ as Savior. The many things that happen at the moment of
salvation are accomplished by God the Holy Spirit, not us, and these are not felt.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Baptism of the Holy Spirit was prophesied by John the
Baptist. Matt. 3:11; Mark 1:8; Luke 3:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>““As for me, I baptize you with water for repentance, but He
who is coming after me is mightier than I, and I am not fit to remove His
sandals; He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew
3:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““I baptized you with water; but He will baptize you with the
Holy Spirit.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Mark 1:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“John answered and said to them all, “As for me, I baptize you
with water; but One is coming who is mightier than I, and I am not fit to untie
the thong of His sandals; He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Luke
3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Baptism of the Holy spirit was prophesied by Jesus
Christ in John 14:20, Acts 1:5, and John 7:37-39.</p>

<p class=Verses>““In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in
Me, and I in you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 14:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus
stood and cried out, saying, &quot;If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and
drink. &quot;He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, 'From his innermost
being will flow rivers of living water.'&quot; But this He spoke of the Spirit,
whom those who believed in Him were to receive; for the Spirit was not yet
given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.&quot;  (John 7:37-39, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Baptism of the Spirit did not occur in the Old
Testament or in any previous dispensation. The Baptism of the Holy Spirit is
related to the Church Age only. Acts 1:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with
the Holy Spirit not many days from now.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 1:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><a name="_First_Uses_of"></a>In Acts 2:1-4, “they” refers
to the Lord’s disciples in Jerusalem on the Day of Pentecost.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When the day of Pentecost had come, they were all
together in one place. And suddenly there came from heaven a noise like a
violent rushing wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.
And there appeared to them tongues as of fire distributing themselves, and they
rested on each one of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and
began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit was giving them
utterance.&quot;  (Acts 2:1-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 10:44-45 and Acts 11:15, Gentile believers receive
the Baptism of the Holy Spirit for the first time.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy
Spirit fell upon all those who were listening to the message. All the
circumcised believers who came with Peter were amazed, because the gift of the
Holy Spirit had been poured out on the Gentiles also.&quot;  (Acts 10:44-45,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon
them just as He did upon us at the beginning.&quot;  (Acts 11:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 19:1-6, other believers of the Age of Israel in
various locations and at different times received the Baptism of the Holy
Spirit, entering them into union with Christ, making them Church Age believers.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;It happened that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul
passed through the upper country and came to Ephesus, and found some disciples.
He said to them, &quot;Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?&quot;
And they said to him, &quot;No, we have not even heard whether there is a Holy
Spirit.&quot; And he said, &quot;Into what then were you baptized?&quot; And
they said, &quot;Into John's baptism.&quot; Paul said, &quot;John baptized with
the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in Him who was coming
after him, that is, in Jesus.&quot; When they heard this, they were baptized in
the name of the Lord Jesus. And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the
Holy Spirit came on them, and they began speaking with tongues and
prophesying.&quot;  (Acts 19:1-6, NASB)</p>
