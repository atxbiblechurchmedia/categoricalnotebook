<h2>Bread</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ was being tempted as to the sufficiency of
the grace of God the Father in providing His every need. Human viewpoint here
would be for Christ to turn the stones to bread because He was extremely
hungry. However, in order to turn stones into bread, He would have had to use
His volition apart from the plan of God the Father. If He had, He would no
longer be in fellowship with God the Holy Spirit. Hence, the relationship of
Jesus Christ’s humanity and the Holy Spirit were under testing. Matt. 4:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the tempter came and said to Him, “If You are the Son of
God, command that these stones become bread.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 4:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ was being tempted to obtain much needed food
apart from the timing of God the Father’s plan. He could have performed the
miracle for Himself or He could wait for the Father. He knew the Father had a
plan for Him – to go to the Cross. He chose to wait for the Father’s timing. This
introduces the faith-rest issue. At this time, the Father would not permit the
humanity of Jesus Christ to die. The Old Testament tells how He would die.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Bread (physical food) is necessary for life, but bread is
a detail in man’s dependence on God. It is not the food, but the promise that
guarantees the food that counts. You always have the promise in God’s Word.
Matt. 4:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But He answered and said, “It is written, ‘MAN SHALL NOT LIVE
ON BREAD ALONE, BUT ON EVERY WORD THAT PROCEEDS OUT OF THE MOUTH OF GOD.’““&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew
4:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>While bread is necessary to sustain life, it is a detail
in survival. What really sustains the believer is the promises of the Word in
their spiritual life. Note that it says man shall live on “every word.” A
pastor-teacher needs to get the whole counsel of the Word. This can be done
only through application of the I.C.E principles. “I” stands for Isagogics
which is interpreting the Bible in accordance with the time in which it was
written - historical settings, cultural facts and so on. “C” stands for Categories
or Bible doctrine subject matter. “E” stands for Exegesis which is verse by
verse exposition using the original languages. Isaiah 28. See category on <a
href="#_D-Hermeneutics">Hermeneutics</a>.</p>
