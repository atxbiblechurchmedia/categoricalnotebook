<h2>The Believer’s Proper Mental Attitude</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Proper Expression of the Believer</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is a detailed doctrinal study of Romans 12 where the
growing believer’s many responsibilities and proper functions are presented.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We have the soul expression, the overt expression, and
the potential hazard of the believer priesthood in Romans 12:1-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to
present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is
your spiritual service of worship. And do not be conformed to this world, but
be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the
will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect. For through the
grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think more highly of
himself than he ought to think; but to think so as to have sound judgment, as
God has allotted to each a measure of faith.&quot;  (Romans 12:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is an interdependence within the believer
priesthood. Rom. 12:4-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For just as we have many members in one body and all the
members do not have the same function, so we, who are many, are one body in
Christ, and individually members one of another.&quot;  (Romans 12:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is a diversity of the spiritual gifts within the
believer priesthood. Rom. 12:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Since we have gifts that differ according to the grace
given to us, each of us is to exercise them accordingly: if prophecy, according
to the proportion of his faith;&quot;  (Romans 12:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 12:7-8, we have the limitation on the overt
function of spiritual gifts in the believer priesthood, that of staying within
your proper gift function.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;if service, in his serving; or he who teaches, in his
teaching; or he who exhorts, in his exhortation; he who gives, with liberality;
he who leads, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.&quot; 
(Romans 12:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Proper Mental Attitude For The Believer Priesthood
And Spiritual Gift Functions</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The proper mental attitude necessary for the believer
priesthood function and spiritual gift function is that of unconditional love. In
Romans 12:9, the word “love” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>γα</span>́<span
lang=EL>πη</span> (agapē) and is a mental attitude love. “Without hypocrisy”
is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>νυπο</span>́<span lang=EL>κριτος</span>
(anupokritos) and means unfeigned, undisguised. This is the alpha privative of <span
lang=EL>υ</span>̔<span lang=EL>ποκρι</span>́<span lang=EL>νομαι</span>
(hupokrinomai) which means to give off a judgment, to be an actor on the stage,
to impersonate another, play a part, to simulate, pretend, to play the
hypocrite. This is exhibiting a phony relaxed mental attitude.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil; cling
to what is good.&quot;  (Romans 12:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Following are some illustrations of the Greek word <span
lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>νυπο</span>́<span lang=EL>κριτος</span>
(anupokritos) and its significance. In 2 Corinthians 6:6, “in genuine love”
means not phony love.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;in purity, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in the
Holy Spirit, in genuine love,&quot;  (2 Corinthians 6:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Timothy 1:5 and 2 Timothy 1:5, “and a sincere faith”
means not a phony faith.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But the goal of our instruction is love from a pure heart
and a good conscience and a sincere faith.&quot;  (1 Timothy 1:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For I am mindful of the sincere faith within you, which
first dwelt in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am sure that
it is in you as well.&quot;  (2 Timothy 1:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Peter 1:22, “for a sincere love of the brethren” is
not a phony love.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Since you have in obedience to the truth purified your
souls for a sincere love of the brethren, fervently love one another from the
heart,&quot;  (1 Peter 1:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In James 3:17, “wisdom...without hypocrisy” is not a
phony form of wisdom.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable,
gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, unwavering, without
hypocrisy.&quot;  (James 3:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 Thessalonians 5:11-28 presents a parallel accounts to
Romans 12:9-21. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Proper Mental Attitude Toward Evil</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Romans 12:9 presents the proper mental attitude toward
evil - to abhor it, to shudder at it.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil; cling
to what is good.&quot;  (Romans 12:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 12:9, “Abhor” is the present active participle of
<span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>ποστυγε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(apostugeō) meaning to dislike, to abhor, to have horror of, to shudder at. “Evil”
is <span lang=EL>πονηρο</span>́<span lang=EL>ς</span> (ponēros) and is the
active worker or work of evil. One that puts others in trouble, with positive
activity of evil coming out. This is contrasted to <span lang=EL>κακο</span>́<span
lang=EL>ς</span> (kakos) which is bad in the sense of worn out, deficient,
unskillful, lacking normal characteristics needed. <i>Kakos</i> is opposite to <span
lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>γαθο</span>́<span lang=EL>ς</span> (agathos). <i>Ponēros</i>
is the opposite to that which is useful, fit for use. <i>Kakos</i> is satisfied
to perish in its own corruption while <i>ponēros</i> is not content unless he
is corrupting others and drawing them in with him.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is a neuter in form and thus indicates the
production of evil, that which is the work of evil activity. The believer is to
have a mental attitude of horror and hate for this kind of activity and
production. Tolerance probably would better characterize the normal Christian
attitude today, but this is not what is indicated here. We must have a proper
mental attitude toward good, to cleave, to be glued to it. “Cling to” is the
present middle participle, intensive middle of <span lang=EL>κολλα</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (kollaō) and means to glue to, be glued to, glue together,
cement, fasten together, to join one’s self to, to give one’s self steadfastly
to or labor for.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are to cling to “what is good” or <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span
lang=EL>γαθο</span>́<span lang=EL>ς</span> (agathos) and means of good
constitution or nature, useful, feeling awakened by what is good, pleasant,
agreeable, joyful or happy, excellent, distinguished, upright and honorable. This
is one of the two uses for the neuter. The other being a good thing,
convenience, advantage. In the Old Testament, <i>agathos</i> would indicate the
absolute idea of moral goodness. Agathos contrasted to <span lang=EL>καλο</span>́<span
lang=EL>ς</span> (kalos). <i>Agathos</i> is good because it is beneficial. <i>Kalos</i>
is good intrinsically. The intrinsic good of <i>kalos</i> is that because it is
well adapted to its circumstances or ends, of that because it is ethically
good, right, noble, honorable.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Titus 2:14, καλός (kalos) is also related to divine
good production. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;who gave Himself for us to redeem us from every lawless
deed, and to purify for Himself a people for His own possession, zealous for
good deeds.&quot;  (Titus 2:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Thessalonians 5:15, this is <i>agathos</i>, the good
which is beneficial.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;See that no one repays another with evil for evil, but
always seek after that which is good for one another and for all people.&quot; 
(1 Thessalonians 5:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Proper Mental Attitude Toward Other Believers</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 12:10, there are three types of love in this
verse; mental attitude love, brotherly love, and family type love in the royal
family - <i>agape</i>, <i>philos</i>, and <i>storge</i>. The proper mental
attitude will express itself in properly esteeming the worth of a fellow
believer because of his believer priesthood, their spiritual gift and their
position in the royal family of God.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; Be devoted to one another in brotherly love; give
preference to one another in honor;&quot;  (Romans 12:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Be devoted” is <span lang=EL>φιλο</span>́<span lang=EL>στοργος</span>
(philostorgos) and is the mutual love of husbands and wives, parents and
children. This is applied to the believers in the spiritual family and is a
family type love. We must also have a proper mental attitude love toward other
members of the royal family.  “One another” is a reciprocal pronoun, reflexive,
accusative plural of direction of <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>λλη</span>́<span
lang=EL>λων</span> (allēlōn) and means one another, reciprocally, mutually.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“In brotherly love” is <span lang=EL>φιλαδελφι</span>́<span
lang=EL>α</span> (philadelphia) and means brotherly love, an instrument of
association.  This is <i>phileo</i> love. We must have a proper mental attitude
of brotherly love and is the love where Christians cherish one another. “Give
preference” is <span lang=EL>προηγε</span>́<span lang=EL>ομαι</span>
(proēgeomai) and means to go before and show the way, to go before and lead,
to go before as a leader, to go before as an example of courtesy to the wishes
of another because of their worth. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“In honor” is <span lang=EL>τιμη</span>́ (timē) and
means deference, reverence, honor. Webster defines deference as “the courteous
regard for another’s wishes.” In the Greek, it is the honor which belongs or is
shown to someone. Webster defines honor as “the esteem due or paid to worth.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 27:9, <span lang=EL>τιμη</span>́ (timē) means
eager to esteem the worth of another believer, valuing by which the price is
fixed, honor, deference, reverence. It means honor, esteem for a person because
of the price paid for the person.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet
was fulfilled: &quot;AND THEY TOOK THE THIRTY PIECES OF SILVER, THE PRICE OF
THE ONE WHOSE PRICE HAD BEEN SET by the sons of Israel;&quot;  (Matthew 27:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 5:4, <span lang=EL>τιμη</span>́ (timē) means
honor of one who outranks others, that by state of office. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And no one takes the honor to himself, but receives it
when he is called by God, even as Aaron was.&quot;  (Hebrews 5:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Peter 2:7, <span lang=EL>τιμη</span>́ (timē) means
precious, praise of which one is judged worthy.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;This precious value, then, is for you who believe; but
for those who disbelieve, &quot;THE STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS REJECTED, THIS
BECAME THE VERY CORNER stone, &quot;&quot;  (1 Peter 2:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 4:44 and Hebrews 3:3, <span lang=EL>τιμη</span>́
(timē) means to have honor, to be honored. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor
in his own country.&quot;  (John 4:44, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For He has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses,
by just so much as the builder of the house has more honor than the
house.&quot;  (Hebrews 3:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 27:9, <span lang=EL>τιμα</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(timaō) means to estimate or fix a value. In Mark 7:10, it means to honor and
revere parents. In 1 Timothy 5:3, it means to honor widows. In John 12:26, it
refers to God rewarding believers. In Acts 28:10, <span lang=EL>τιμα</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (timaō) refers to honor given to the disciples. In 1 Peter
2:17, it refers to honor to all people.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet
was fulfilled: &quot;AND THEY TOOK THE THIRTY PIECES OF SILVER, THE PRICE OF
THE ONE WHOSE PRICE HAD BEEN SET by the sons of Israel;&quot;  (Matthew 27:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;For Moses said, 'HONOR YOUR FATHER AND YOUR
MOTHER'; and, 'HE WHO SPEAKS EVIL OF FATHER OR MOTHER, IS TO BE PUT TO DEATH';
&quot;  (Mark 7:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Honor widows who are widows indeed;&quot;  (1 Timothy
5:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;If anyone serves Me, he must follow Me; and where
I am, there My servant will be also; if anyone serves Me, the Father will honor
him. &quot;  (John 12:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;They also honored us with many marks of respect; and when
we were setting sail, they supplied us with all we needed.&quot;  (Acts 28:10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Honor all people, love the brotherhood, fear God, honor
the king.&quot;  (1 Peter 2:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 8:54, John 11:4, John 16:14, John 17:10, Romans
8:30, John 13:31-32, John 21:19, 1 Peter 4:11, Romans 11:13, 1 Corinthians
12:26, Matthew 6:2, and Luke 4:15, δοξάζω (doxazō) means to cause the dignity
and worth of some person or thing to become manifest and acknowledged.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Jesus answered, &quot;If I glorify Myself, My glory is
nothing; it is My Father who glorifies Me, of whom you say, 'He is our God';
&quot;  (John 8:54, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But when Jesus heard this, He said, &quot;This sickness
is not to end in death, but for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be
glorified by it.&quot; &quot;  (John 11:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with
it; if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.&quot;  (1 Corinthians
12:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He began teaching in their synagogues and was praised
by all.&quot;  (Luke 4:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 4:10, Luke 13:17, and Luke 7:25, <span
lang=EL>ε</span>̓́<span lang=EL>νδοξος</span> (endoxos) means to hold in good
or great esteem, honorable, notable, splendid.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are prudent in
Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are distinguished, but we are
without honor.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 4:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;As He said this, all His opponents were being humiliated;
and the entire crowd was rejoicing over all the glorious things being done by
Him.&quot;  (Luke 13:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in
soft clothing? Those who are splendidly clothed and live in luxury are found in
royal palaces! &quot;  (Luke 7:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Philippians 2:29, Luke 7:2, Luke 14:8, 1 Peter 2:4,
and 1 Peter 2:6, <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓́<span lang=EL>ντιμος</span> (entimos) means
held in honor, prized, precious, honorable, noble, to hold one dear or in
honor, to value highly.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Receive him then in the Lord with all joy, and hold men
like him in high regard;&quot;  (Philippians 2:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And a centurion's slave, who was highly regarded by him,
was sick and about to die.&quot;  (Luke 7:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;When you are invited by someone to a wedding
feast, do not take the place of honor, for someone more distinguished than you
may have been invited by him, &quot;  (Luke 14:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And coming to Him as to a living stone which has been
rejected by men, but is choice and precious in the sight of God,&quot;  (1
Peter 2:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For this is contained in Scripture: &quot;BEHOLD, I LAY
IN ZION A CHOICE STONE, A PRECIOUS CORNER stone, AND HE WHO BELIEVES IN HIM
WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.&quot;&quot;  (1 Peter 2:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Revelation 17:4, Revelation 18:12, Revelation 18:16, 1
Corinthians 3:12, 1 Peter 1:7, Revelation 21:11, and Hebrews 13:4, <span
lang=EL>τι</span>́<span lang=EL>μιος</span> (timios) means precious, held as of
a great price, held in honor, esteemed, especially dear.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and adorned
with gold and precious stones and pearls, having in her hand a gold cup full of
abominations and of the unclean things of her immorality,&quot;  (Revelation
17:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold,
silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw,&quot;  (1 Corinthians 3:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Marriage is to be held in honor among all, and the
marriage bed is to be undefiled; for fornicators and adulterers God will
judge.&quot;  (Hebrews 13:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 12:17, 2 Corinthians 8:21, and 2 Corinthians 13:7,
<span lang=EL>καλο</span>́<span lang=EL>ς</span> (kalos) means to be honored or
esteemed because a thing has intrinsic good which is well adapted to its
circumstances or ends, of that because it is ethically good, right, noble.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Never pay back evil for evil to anyone. Respect what is
right in the sight of all men.&quot;  (Romans 12:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;for we have regard for what is honorable, not only in the
sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 8:21,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now we pray to God that you do no wrong; not that we
ourselves may appear approved, but that you may do what is right, even though
we may appear unapproved.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 13:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 13:57 and Mark 6:4, <span lang=EL>α</span>̓́<span
lang=EL>τιμος</span> (atimos) means without honor, dishonored. In 1 Corinthians
12:23, it means base, of less esteem.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And they took offense at Him. But Jesus said to them,
&quot;A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and in his own
household.&quot; &quot;  (Matthew 13:57, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Jesus said to them, &quot;A prophet is not without honor

Phil. 2:3; Phil. 2:6; 1 Thess. 5:13; 2 Cor. 9:5. This is to consider, deem,
account, think, to go before, to be a leader. In contexts, to be a leader in
esteeming another believer, to esteem one exceedingly.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;'AND YOU, BETHLEHEM, LAND OF JUDAH, ARE BY NO MEANS LEAST
AMONG THE LEADERS OF JUDAH; FOR OUT OF YOU SHALL COME FORTH A RULER WHO WILL
SHEPHERD MY PEOPLE ISRAEL.'&quot;&quot;  (Matthew 2:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Greet all of your leaders and all the saints. Those from
Italy greet you.&quot;  (Hebrews 13:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;who, although He existed in the form of God, did not
regard equality with God a thing to be grasped,&quot;  (Philippians 2:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So I thought it necessary to urge the brethren that they
would go on ahead to you and arrange beforehand your previously promised
bountiful gift, so that the same would be ready as a bountiful gift and not
affected by covetousness.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 9:5, NASB)</p>

lang=EL>νω</span> (krinō) has one meaning among several, to approve, esteem,
to prefer.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;One person regards one day above another, another regards
every day alike. Each person must be fully convinced in his own mind.&quot; 
(Romans 14:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly and said, &quot;It was
necessary that the word of God be spoken to you first; since you repudiate it
and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we are turning to the
Gentiles.&quot;  (Acts 13:46, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 14:14, <span lang=EL>λογι</span>́<span lang=EL>ζομαι</span>
(logizomai) means to think, to reckon.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing is
unclean in itself; but to him who thinks anything to be unclean, to him it is
unclean.&quot;  (Romans 14:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Proper Mental Attitude Toward Accomplishment</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer must have the proper mental attitude toward
accomplishment. This mental attitude has several characteristics. They are
freedom from reluctance or hesitation, eagerness to accomplish, striving to do
a thing, and diligence in promoting to accomplishment. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 12:11, 2 Corinthians 8:11-12, Hebrews 6:11,
Jude 1:3, 2 Peter 1:5, and 2 Corinthians 8:16, <span lang=EL>σπουδη</span>́
(spoudē) means earnestness, diligence in accomplishing, promoting or striving
after anything.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;not lagging behind in diligence, fervent in spirit,
serving the Lord;&quot;  (Romans 12:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But now finish doing it also, so that just as there was
the readiness to desire it, so there may be also the completion of it by your
ability. For if the readiness is present, it is acceptable according to what a
person has, not according to what he does not have.&quot;  (2 Corinthians
8:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And we desire that each one of you show the same
diligence so as to realize the full assurance of hope until the end,&quot; 
(Hebrews 6:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now for this very reason also, applying all diligence, in
your faith supply moral excellence, and in your moral excellence,
knowledge,&quot;  (2 Peter 1:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Other Greek words related to accomplishment or mental
attitude follow-through are discussed below. In 2 Timothy 3:17 and Acts 21:5 <span
lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>ξαρτι</span>́<span lang=EL>ζω</span> (exartizō)
refers to the Word of God being that which “equips, fits, completes, perfects,”
and accomplishes the preparation of a believer that they can complete and
finish every good work.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for
every good work.&quot;  (2 Timothy 3:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When our days there were ended, we left and started on
our journey, while they all, with wives and children, escorted us until we were
out of the city. After kneeling down on the beach and praying, we said farewell
to one another.&quot;  (Acts 21:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Revelation 3:2 and Luke 9:31, <span lang=EL>πληρο</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (plēroō) means to fill a deficiency, supply liberally, to
complete, to accomplish, to consummate, to carry through to the end, to perform
duties, to ratify, to bring to pass. Lack of accomplishment is known by the
Lord. Accomplishment takes place at a point of time with geographical location,
time, and circumstances. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; 'Wake up, and strengthen the things that remain, which
were about to die; for I have not found your deeds completed in the sight of My
God. &quot;  (Revelation 3:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And behold, two men were talking with Him; and they were
Moses and Elijah, who, appearing in glory, were speaking of His departure which
He was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.&quot;  (Luke 9:30-31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Revelation 10:7, Revelation 11:7, Luke 2:39, and Revelation
15:1, <span lang=EL>τελε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (teleō) means to
finish, end, bring to a close, to perform, complete, fulfill, to pay.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when
he is about to sound, then the mystery of God is finished, as He preached to
His servants the prophets.&quot;  (Revelation 10:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When they have finished their testimony, the beast that
comes up out of the abyss will make war with them, and overcome them and kill
them.&quot;  (Revelation 11:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When they had performed everything according to the Law
of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own city of Nazareth.&quot; 
(Luke 2:39, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous,
seven angels who had seven plagues, which are the last, because in them the
wrath of God is finished.&quot;  (Revelation 15:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 15:28, 2 Corinthians 7:1, 2 Corinthians 8:6, 2 Corinthians
8:11, Galatians 3:3, Philippians 1:6, Hebrews 8:5, Hebrews 9:6, and 1 Peter
5:9, <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>πιτελε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(epiteleō) means to bring to an end, accomplish, perfect, complete, to take
upon one’s self.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore, when I have finished this, and have put my
seal on this fruit of theirs, I will go on by way of you to Spain.&quot; 
(Romans 15:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you
now being perfected by the flesh?&quot;  (Galatians 3:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same
experiences of suffering are being accomplished by your brethren who are in the
world.&quot;  (1 Peter 5:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 4:34, John 5:36, John 17:4, and Acts 20:24, <span
lang=EL>τελειο</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (teleioō) means to carry through
completely, to accomplish, finish, bring to an end, to add what is yet lacking
in order to render a thing full, to consummate, bring to completion.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Jesus said to them, &quot;My food is to do the will of
Him who sent Me and to accomplish His work. &quot;  (John 4:34, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;But the testimony which I have is greater than the
testimony of John; for the works which the Father has given Me to
accomplish—the very works that I do—testify about Me, that the Father has sent
Me. &quot;  (John 5:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;I glorified You on the earth, having accomplished
the work which You have given Me to do. &quot;  (John 17:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;But I do not consider my life of any account as
dear to myself, so that I may finish my course and the ministry which I
received from the Lord Jesus, to testify solemnly of the gospel of the grace of
God.&quot;  (Acts 20:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 1:23, Luke 2:6, and Luke 2:21-22, <span lang=EL>πι</span>́<span
lang=EL>μπλημι</span> (pimplēmi) means to be fulfilled, completed, finished,
filled up.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When the days of his priestly service were ended, he went
back home.&quot;  (Luke 1:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;While they were there, the days were completed for her to
give birth.&quot;  (Luke 2:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And when eight days had passed, before His circumcision,
His name was then called Jesus, the name given by the angel before He was
conceived in the womb. And when the days for their purification according to
the law of Moses were completed, they brought Him up to Jerusalem to present
Him to the Lord&quot;  (Luke 2:21-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 25:26 and Philippians 3:1, <span lang=EL>ο</span>̓<span
lang=EL>κνηρο</span>́<span lang=EL>ς</span> (oknēros) means to be sluggish,
slothful, backward, to be reluctant. It comes from the verb οκνεω, which means
to feel loath, to be slow, to delay, hesitate. This denotes the moral
earnestness with which one should give themselves to their vocation. We are not
to be lazy in mental attitude.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;But his master answered and said to him, 'You
wicked, lazy slave, you knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I
scattered no seed. &quot;  (Matthew 25:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the
same things again is no trouble to me, and it is a safeguard for you.&quot; 
(Philippians 3:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Proper Mental Attitude Toward Zeal</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 12:11, the phrase “in spirit” is <span lang=EL>πνευ</span>͂<span
lang=EL>μα</span> (pneuma) and refers to the filling of the Holy Spirit.
“Fervent” is the present active participle of <span lang=EL>ζε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span><span lang=EL> </span>(zeō) and means zealous or fervent for
what is good. Acts 18:25.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;not lagging behind in diligence, fervent in spirit,
serving the Lord;&quot;  (Romans 12:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and
being fervent in spirit, he was speaking and teaching accurately the things
concerning Jesus, being acquainted only with the baptism of John;&quot;  (Acts
18:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Revelation 3:19, “zealous” is <span lang=EL>ζηλευ</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (zēleuō) and means to envy, be jealous, to imitate
emulously, strive after, to be full of zeal for good, be zealous. Webster
defines the word as “active interest and enthusiasm in the pursuit of a thing.”</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; 'Those whom I love, I reprove and discipline; therefore
be zealous and repent. &quot;  (Revelation 3:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Philippians 3:6, 2 Corinthians 9:2, 2 Corinthians 7:11,
John 2:17, Romans 10:2, Colossians 4:13, 2 Corinthians 11:2, Hebrews 10:27, Romans
13:13, and 1 Corinthians 3:3, <span lang=EL>ζη</span>͂<span lang=EL>λος</span>
(zēlos) means excitement of mind, zeal in pursuing, defending anything, the
fierceness of indignation, an envious and contentious rivalry, jealousy.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to the righteousness
which is in the Law, found blameless.&quot;  (Philippians 3:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;His disciples remembered that it was written, &quot;ZEAL
FOR YOUR HOUSE WILL CONSUME ME.&quot;&quot;  (John 2:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For I testify for him that he has a deep concern for you
and for those who are in Laodicea and Hierapolis.&quot;  (Colossians 4:13,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;for you are still fleshly. For since there is jealousy
and strife among you, are you not fleshly, and are you not walking like mere
men?&quot;  (1 Corinthians 3:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Revelation 3:19, <span lang=EL>ζηλευ</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (zēleuō) means zealous in the good sense, to be zealous in
the pursuit of good. In 1 Corinthians 12:31, 1 Corinthians 14:1, 1 Corinthians 14:39,
2 Corinthians 7:2, and Galatians 4:17 <span lang=EL>ζηλευ</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(zēleuō)  means to desire earnestly, to pursue. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; 'Those whom I love, I reprove and discipline; therefore
be zealous and repent. &quot;  (Revelation 3:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But earnestly desire the greater gifts. And I show you a
still more excellent way.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 12:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore, my brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy, and
do not forbid to speak in tongues.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 14:39, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;They eagerly seek you, not commendably, but they wish to
shut you out so that you will seek them.&quot;  (Galatians 4:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 14:12, Titus 2:14, 1 Peter 3:13, Acts
21:20, and Galatians 1:14, <span lang=EL>ζηλωτη</span>́<span lang=EL>ς</span>
(zēlōtēs) means one burning with zeal, jealous of any rival and sternly
vindicating your control, most eagerly desirous of, zealous for a thing.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So also you, since you are zealous of spiritual gifts,
seek to abound for the edification of the church.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 14:12,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;who gave Himself for us to redeem us from every lawless
deed, and to purify for Himself a people for His own possession, zealous for
good deeds.&quot;  (Titus 2:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And when they heard it they began glorifying God; and
they said to him, &quot;You see, brother, how many thousands there are among
the Jews of those who have believed, and they are all zealous for the
Law;&quot;  (Acts 21:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my
contemporaries among my countrymen, being more extremely zealous for my
ancestral traditions.&quot;  (Galatians 1:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 15:29, “have been serving you” is the present
active participle of <span lang=EL>δουλευ</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(douleuō) and means to be a slave, to serve, to do service. Metaphorically, to
obey one’s commands and render to him the services due. This is used in a good
sense. The prodigal son’s brother is saying; “My service should enable me to
receive better treatment. It’s just not fair that after all these years,
someone less worthy than myself should be getting all the attention.”</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;But he answered and said to his father, 'Look! For
so many years I have been serving you and I have never neglected a command of
yours; and yet you have never given me a young goat, so that I might celebrate
with my friends; &quot;  (Luke 15:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divided loyalties are impossible to maintain if one is
going to serve the Lord properly. Matt. 6:24; Luke 16:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;No one can serve two masters; for either he will
hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the
other. You cannot serve God and wealth. &quot;  (Matthew 6:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;No servant can serve two masters; for either he
will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be devoted to one and
despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.&quot; &quot;  (Luke 16:13,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Serving God is seen as antithetical to serving idols and
is a result of a proper relationship and fellowship with God. 1 Thess. 1:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For they themselves report about us what kind of a
reception we had with you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve a
living and true God,&quot;  (1 Thessalonians 1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 20:19, “humility” is <span lang=EL>ταπεινοφροσυ</span>́<span
lang=EL>νη</span> (tapeinophrosunē) and means having a humble opinion of one’s
self, modesty, lowliness of mind. “Tears” is <span lang=EL>δα</span>́<span
lang=EL>κρυ</span> (dakru) and means to weep or shed tears. “Trials” is <span
lang=EL>πειρασμο</span>́<span lang=EL>ς</span> (peirasmos) and means trials,
testings.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and
with trials which came upon me through the plots of the Jews;&quot;  (Acts
20:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Service is a responsibility of a believer, not an option.
Service is not done to men but unto the Lord. We don’t minister to please men. Rom.
12:11; Eph. 6:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;not lagging behind in diligence, fervent in spirit,
serving the Lord;&quot;  (Romans 12:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;With good will render service, as to the Lord, and not to
men,&quot;  (Ephesians 6:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If the person serves the Lord in the proper way, they
will find themselves being accepted by the people as well. Rom. 14:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For he who in this way serves Christ is acceptable to God
and approved by men.&quot;  (Romans 14:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Proper Mental Attitude Toward Hope</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Romans 12:12 presents the proper mental attitude and
response toward hope. “Rejoicing” is <span lang=EL>χαι</span>́<span lang=EL>ρω</span>
(chairō) and means to rejoice, be glad, to rejoice exceedingly, to be well, to
thrive. “Hope is <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>λπι</span>́<span lang=EL>ς</span>
(elpis) and means joyful and confident expectation. Each believer has the hope
of the bodily resurrection which no person, government or circumstance can take
from them. Acts 23:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;rejoicing in hope, persevering in tribulation, devoted to
prayer,&quot;  (Romans 12:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But perceiving that one group were Sadducees and the
other Pharisees, Paul began crying out in the Council, &quot;Brethren, I am a
Pharisee, a son of Pharisees; I am on trial for the hope and resurrection of
the dead!&quot;&quot;  (Acts 23:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer’s mental attitude is to be hope of the
fulfillment of promises as given by God. The context is Israel, but the analogy
is still true. Acts 26:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; the promise to which our twelve tribes hope to attain,
as they earnestly serve God night and day. And for this hope, O King, I am
being accused by Jews.&quot;  (Acts 26:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Hope is built into a believer’s soul by several factors.
We have been justified. This is a permanent position. We have the potential for
peace. We have access into God's grace resources. We can rejoice because of a
certain and confident hope. We have a grace standing. Rom. 5:12; Rom. 5:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the
world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all
sinned—&quot;  (Romans 5:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For if by the transgression of the one, death reigned
through the one, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the
gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.&quot; 
(Romans 5:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are participants in God’s plan. The believer’s tribulation
works out patience and patience works out approval. Approval works out hope and
hope makes not ashamed, although the anticipation and expectation may seem
quite far removed from your current circumstances of life. Rejoicing in hope is
one of the responsibilities of believers. We have a living hope because of the
resurrection of Christ. Rom. 12:11; 1 Peter 1:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;not lagging behind in diligence, fervent in spirit,
serving the Lord;&quot;  (Romans 12:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
who according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living
hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,&quot;  (1 Peter
1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We should understand and be able to explain our hope of
the future to others.. The believer’s hope is to be a source of comfort and
stability in this life. 1 Peter 3:15, 2 Thess. 2:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;but sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, always being
ready to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the
hope that is in you, yet with gentleness and reverence;&quot;  (1 Peter 3:15,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself and God our Father,
who has loved us and given us eternal comfort and good hope by grace,&quot;  (2
Thessalonians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Hope is the expectation of faith and hope is that which
faith anticipates. Hope is a mutual sharing between believers and therefore a
comfort. As you see others suffering, you should be able to recall that they also
will be partakers of the consolation or comfort. Rom. 8:24; 2 Cor. 1:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For in hope we have been saved, but hope that is seen is
not hope; for who hopes for what he already sees?&quot;  (Romans 8:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and our hope for you is firmly grounded, knowing that as
you are sharers of our sufferings, so also you are sharers of our
comfort.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul had a hope that gave him confidence that he would
not be an embarrassing disappointment in the plan of God. God’s plan is not
full of embarrassing situations. Hope is seen as the expectation that one has
during their preparation and the fulfillment they have in their spiritual production.
The hope of righteousness of the believer with eternal aspects is perpetuated
by faith and characterized by endurance. Phil. 1:20; 1 Cor. 9:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;according to my earnest expectation and hope, that I will
not be put to shame in anything, but that with all boldness, Christ will even
now, as always, be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death.&quot; 
(Philippians 1:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Or is He speaking altogether for our sake? Yes, for our
sake it was written, because the plowman ought to plow in hope, and the
thresher to thresh in hope of sharing the crops. &quot;  (1 Corinthians 9:10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Believer’s Responsibility Under Pressure</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 12:12, “persevering” is <span lang=EL>υ</span>̔<span
lang=EL>πομε</span>́<span lang=EL>νω</span> (hupomenō) and means to undergo,
to remain, to patiently endure, to bear. “Tribulation” is <span lang=EL>θλι</span>́<span
lang=EL>ψις</span> (thlipsis) and means pressure, oppression, affliction,
tribulation. We are to use God's grace resources and the application of the <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine in our souls to every situation in life.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;rejoicing in hope, persevering in tribulation, devoted to
prayer,&quot;  (Romans 12:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is distress that is brought about by outward
circumstances. 2 Cor. 4:17; Rom. 2:9; 1 Thess. 1:6; 2 Cor. 8:13; James 1:27.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For momentary, light affliction is producing for us an
eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison,&quot;  (2 Corinthians 4:17,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; There will be tribulation and distress for every soul of
man who does evil, of the Jew first and also of the Greek,&quot;  (Romans 2:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Pure and undefiled religion in the sight of our God and
Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their distress, and to keep
oneself unstained by the world.&quot;  (James 1:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Distress is used in a figurative sense to show mental and
spiritual states of mind and indicates trouble and anguish of heart. 2 Cor. 2:4;
Phil. 1:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote
to you with many tears; not so that you would be made sorrowful, but that you
might know the love which I have especially for you.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 2:4,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;the former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition rather
than from pure motives, thinking to cause me distress in my
imprisonment.&quot;  (Philippians 1:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Pressure builds patience and is a building block in God’s
plan for the believer to develop spiritual hope or expectation. Rom. 5:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And not only this, but we also exult in our tribulations,
knowing that tribulation brings about perseverance;&quot;  (Romans 5:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Pressure is one of the responsibilities that one has, or
more correctly, the patient enduring of pressure. Pressure can cause even a
grace-oriented, well-informed, believer such as the Apostle Paul himself, to
even despair of life. But this same believer who realizes their position and
potential will come out rejoicing.  Rom. 12:12; 2 Cor. 1:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;rejoicing in hope, persevering in tribulation, devoted to
prayer,&quot;  (Romans 12:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For we do not want you to be unaware, brethren, of our
affliction which came to us in Asia, that we were burdened excessively, beyond
our strength, so that we despaired even of life;&quot;  (2 Corinthians 1:8,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A believer demonstrates their application of Bible doctrine,
in which they are approved of God, while under pressure. Pressure is the fire
that softens the metal that enables God to mold you into the type of servant He
can use. 2 Cor. 6:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;but in everything commending ourselves as servants of
God, in much endurance, in afflictions, in hardships, in distresses,&quot;  (2
Corinthians 6:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Pressure does not rob a believer of their joy if they
stay in fellowship. Neither does pressure and affliction remove the
responsibilities of a person when they are under pressure. The opposite effect
is shown in 2 Corinthians 8:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;that in a great ordeal of affliction their abundance of
joy and their deep poverty overflowed in the wealth of their liberality.&quot; 
(2 Corinthians 8:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One believer is comforted in their pressure by the
utilization of faith by other members of the Body of Christ. The application of
Bible doctrine by a congregation makes bearable all the strain and pressure that
a pastor-teacher often endures in continual studying and teaching. Often in the
midst of great pressure, the divine viewpoint expressed by believers is a
comfort to him. 1 Thess. 3:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;for this reason, brethren, in all our distress and
affliction we were comforted about you through your faith;&quot;  (1
Thessalonians 3:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pressures of a pastor-teacher can also become very
taxing on a congregation. They are not built to take the pressure that the
pastor can take. Therefore, believers are exhorted to “not faint” at the
pressures of the pastor. The pastor does not need your sympathy, he needs your
prayers. He does not need a lessening of pressures, because he knows his
pressure is for your benefit. Eph. 3:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore I ask you not to lose heart at my tribulations
on your behalf, for they are your glory.&quot;  (Ephesians 3:13, NASB)</p>
