<h2>The Beatitudes</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Beatitudes are found within the Sermon on the Mount which
was a crash program to teach His disciples Bible doctrine. </p>

<p class=Verses>“When Jesus saw the crowds, He went up on the mountain; and
after He sat down, His disciples came to Him. He opened His mouth and began to
teach them, saying,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 5:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The beatitude of salvation is in Matthew 5:3. The term “blessed”
refers to inner happiness. This is a reminder of the grace of salvation. “Poor
in spirit” refers to a spiritual IQ that begins at salvation while filled with
the Holy Spirit. The road to true inner happiness (3rd floor of the edification
complex) begins at the Cross.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of
heaven.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 5:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The beatitude of suffering is in Matthew 5:4 “Those who
mourn” refers to inner happiness as projected from the edification complex of
the soul that can handle any pressure or suffering situation in life. This is a
believer who carries their happiness with them.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i><span style='color:blue'>““Blessed are those who
mourn, for they shall be comforted.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 5:4, NASB)</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The beatitude of relaxed power is in Matthew 5:5. “The gentle”
speaks of grace orientation. This is a believer who is spiritually poised and
is the antithesis of pride power generated by the energy of the flesh.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Blessed are the gentle, for they shall inherit the earth.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew
5:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The beatitude of doctrinal desire is in Matthew 5:6. “Those
who hunger and thirst” is the believer daily learning and applying Bible
doctrine and thereby growing spiritually. Righteousness is God’s brand of
goodness.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,
for they shall be satisfied.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 5:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The beatitude of grace is in Matthew 5:7. “The merciful” is
grace in action. Inner happiness is based upon thinking grace at all times. We
are saved by grace and we continue to function in the spiritual life by grace.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew
5:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The beatitude of confession of sin is in Matthew 5:8. “Pure
in heart’ is based on continued use of 1 John 1:9. No inner happiness is
present when one is out of fellowship. “Shall see God” refers to occupation
with Christ and thinking divine viewpoint as a result of having confessed known
sins to God the Father. If one has not confessed their known sins, they are not
filled with the Spirit. The filling of the Holy Spirit is necessary for the
intake of Bible doctrine, the faith-transfer of <i>gnosis</i> in the left lobe
to <i>epignosis</i> in the right lobe of the soul, resulting in the erection of
the edification complex in the right lobe of the soul.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew
5:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
John 1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The beatitude of witnessing is in Matthew 5:9. “Peacemakers”
are the ones who witness to the way of peace between God and man -
reconciliation. “Called sons of God” refers to those who are identified with
God because they carry His message without mental attitude sins. This speaks of
a relaxed mental attitude.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of
God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 5:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The beatitude of persecution and pressure is in Matthew
5:10-12. Inner happiness is the possession of those who are persecuted for “sake
of righteousness” – for knowing Jesus Christ. Keep on rejoicing by staying in
fellowship, regardless of the circumstances. God’s plan of grace is greater
than any pressure or persecution in life. We are to draw upon the grace of God.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of
righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. “Blessed are you when
people insult you and persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against
you because of Me. “Rejoice and be glad, for your reward in heaven is great;
for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew
5:10-12, NASB)</p>
