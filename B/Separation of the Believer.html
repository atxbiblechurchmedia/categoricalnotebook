<h2><a name="_The_Believer’s_Production_1"></a>Separation of the Believer</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are certain types of carnal believers from whom you
must separate. Their practices and behaviors are listed in 1 Corinthians 5:1
and 1 Corinthians 5:9-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“It is actually reported that there is immorality among you,
and immorality of such a kind as does not exist even among the Gentiles, that
someone has his father’s wife.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 5:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“I wrote you in my letter not to associate with immoral people;
I did not at all mean with the immoral people of this world, or with the
covetous and swindlers, or with idolaters, for then you would have to go out of
the world. But actually, I wrote to you not to associate with any so-called
brother if he is an immoral person, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler,
or a drunkard, or a swindler—not even to eat with such a one.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Corinthians 5:9-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Separation from negative believers includes those who
downgrade or reject Bible doctrine and that may be 99% of the believers in some
areas. You can tell when a person is on negative signals. 2 Thess. 3:6; 2
Thess. 3:14-15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ, that you keep away from every brother who leads an unruly life and not
according to the tradition which you received from us.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2
Thessalonians 3:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“If anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter, take
special note of that person and do not associate with him, so that he will be
put to shame. Yet do not regard him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2
Thessalonians 3:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Separation from believers negative to Bible doctrine includes
those who make emotion the criterion for spirituality and thus enter into
pseudo-spirituality. Rom. 16:17-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now I urge you, brethren, keep your eye on those who cause
dissensions and hindrances contrary to the teaching which you learned, and turn
away from them. For such men are slaves, not of our Lord Christ but of their
own appetites; and by their smooth and flattering speech they deceive the
hearts of the unsuspecting.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 16:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Stay away from believers who are in the Tongues movement
and those who make outward emotionalism an expression of spirituality. This
also includes separation from believers involved with the fast crowd or the wrong
crowd. 1 Peter 4:4; Prov. 1:10-19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“In all this, they are surprised that you do not run with them
into the same excesses of dissipation, and they malign you;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Peter 4:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“My son, if sinners entice you, Do not consent. If they say, “Come
with us, Let us lie in wait for blood, Let us ambush the innocent without
cause; Let us swallow them alive like Sheol, Even whole, as those who go down
to the pit; We will find all kinds of precious wealth, We will fill our houses
with spoil; Throw in your lot with us, We shall all have one purse,” My son, do
not walk in the way with them. Keep your feet from their path, For their feet
run to evil And they hasten to shed blood. Indeed, it is useless to spread the
baited net In the sight of any bird; But they lie in wait for their own blood;
They ambush their own lives. So are the ways of everyone who gains by violence;
It takes away the life of its possessors.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 1:10-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are mandated to separate from unbelievers when you
have to compromise in areas of doctrine. 2 Cor. 6:14; Heb. 13:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do not be bound together with unbelievers; for what
partnership have righteousness and lawlessness, or what fellowship has light
with darkness?”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Corinthians 6:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So, let us go out to Him outside the camp, bearing His
reproach.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 13:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Marriage of a believer to an unbeliever is prohibited. It
isn’t wrong to date an unbeliever. It’s wrong to get involved romantically with
an unbeliever. However, dating is not really necessary until you meet the right
kind of man or the right kind of woman. Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the
soul enables discernment to recognize the right kind of man or the right kind
of woman.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Separation may involve fraternities and sororities with
compulsory dating and drinking. West Point, Annapolis, and Colorado Springs are
all superior because they have no fraternities. Care should be exercised when
entering into a business partnership with an unbeliever. Their human viewpoint
thinking and worldliness may require separation. Rom. 12:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to
present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is
your spiritual service of worship. And do not be conformed to this world, but
be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the
will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
12:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer is to separate from religion and apostacy. 2
Cor. 6:17; 2 Tim. 3:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Therefore, COME OUT FROM THEIR MIDST AND BE SEPARATE,” says
the Lord. “AND DO NOT TOUCH WHAT IS UNCLEAN; And I will welcome you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2
Corinthians 6:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“holding to a form of godliness, although they have denied its
power; Avoid such men as these.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Timothy 3:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Religion victimizes believers by putting scar tissue on
their souls or getting them involved with those who are negative to Bible doctrine.
Activity is the measure of success under such conditions. For a discourse on
religion, read 2 Timothy 3. </p>
