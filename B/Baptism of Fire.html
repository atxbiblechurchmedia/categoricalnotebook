<h2><a name="_D-Baptism_of_Fire"></a><a name="_Baptism_of_Fire"></a>Baptism of
Fire </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Baptism of Fire is the judgment that will come at the
Second Advent of Jesus Christ. All unbelievers will be cast off the earth and
Tribulational believers still physically alive on the earth will go into the
Millennium. The doctrine of the Baptism of Fire is stated in Matthew 3:11-12,
Luke 3:16-17, and 2 Thessalonians 1:7-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>““As for me, I baptize you with water for repentance, but He
who is coming after me is mightier than I, and I am not fit to remove His  sandals;
He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. “His winnowing fork is in
His hand, and He will thoroughly clear His threshing floor; and He will gather
His wheat into the barn, but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew
3:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“John answered and said to them all, “As for me, I baptize you
with water; but One is coming who is mightier than I, and I am not fit to untie
the thong of His sandals; He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. “His
winnowing fork is in His hand to thoroughly clear His threshing floor, and to
gather the wheat into His barn; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable
fire.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Luke 3:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and to give relief to you who are afflicted and to us as well
when the Lord Jesus will be revealed from heaven with His mighty angels in
flaming fire, dealing out retribution to those who do not know God and to those
who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. These will pay the penalty of
eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of
His power,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Thessalonians 1:7-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Noah is used as an analogy for the Baptism of Fire in
Matthew 24:37-41.</p>

<p class=Verses>““For the coming of the Son of Man will be just like the days
of Noah. “For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking,
marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, and
they did not understand until the flood came and took them all away; so will
the coming of the Son of Man be. “Then there will be two men in the field; one
will be taken and one will be left. “Two women will be grinding at the mill;
one will be taken and one will be left.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 24:37-41, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 24:37-41, “One will be taken” refers to judgment
of the unbeliever. “One will be left” refers to the living Tribulational believer
going into the Millennium. Isaiah 13:9-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Behold, the day of the LORD is coming, Cruel, with fury and
burning anger, To make the land a desolation; And He will exterminate its
sinners from it. For the stars of heaven and their constellations Will not
flash forth their light; The sun will be dark when it rises And the moon will
not shed its light.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah 13:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Parables of the Baptism of Fire</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The parable of the wheat and tares is found in Matthew
13:24-30 and Matthew 13:36-43. Wheat refers to Tribulational believers who will
go into the Millennium. Tares refers to unbelievers who will be cast off the
earth in judgment, to be “burned up.”</p>

<p class=Verses>“Jesus presented another parable to them, saying, “The kingdom
of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field. “But while
his men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went
away. “But when the wheat sprouted and bore grain, then the tares became
evident also. “The slaves of the landowner came and said to him, ‘Sir, did you
not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have tares?’ “And he said to
them, ‘An enemy has done this!’ The slaves said to him, ‘Do you want us, then,
to go and gather them up?’ “But he said, ‘No; for while you are gathering up
the tares, you may uproot the wheat with them. ‘Allow both to grow together
until the harvest; and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, “First
gather up the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them up; but gather the
wheat into my barn.”‘““&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 13:24-30, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then He left the crowds and went into the house. And His
disciples came to Him and said, “Explain to us the parable of the tares of the
field.” And He said, “The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man, and the
field is the world; and as for the good seed, these are the sons of the
kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the evil one; and the enemy who sowed
them is the devil, and the harvest is the end of the age; and the reapers are
angels. “So just as the tares are gathered up and burned with fire, so shall it
be at the end of the age. “The Son of Man will send forth His angels, and they
will gather out of His kingdom all stumbling blocks, and those who commit
lawlessness, and will throw them into the furnace of fire; in that place there
will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. “Then THE RIGHTEOUS WILL SHINE FORTH AS
THE SUN in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew
13:36-43, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The parable of a fishing dragnet is found in Matthew
13:47-50. Good fish are believers. Bad fish are unbelievers.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet cast into the
sea, and gathering fish of every kind; and when it was filled, they drew it up
on the beach; and they sat down and gathered the good fish into containers, but
the bad they threw away. “So it will be at the end of the age; the angels will
come forth and take out the wicked from among the righteous, and will throw
them into the furnace of fire; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing
of teeth.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 13:47-50, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The parable of the ten virgins is found in Matthew
25:1-13. Wise are the Jewish believers who will go into the Millennium. The foolish
are unbelievers who will be taken in judgment.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Then the kingdom of heaven will be comparable to ten virgins,
who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. “Five of them were
foolish, and five were prudent. “For when the foolish took their lamps, they
took no oil with them, but the prudent took oil in flasks along with their
lamps. “Now while the bridegroom was delaying, they all got drowsy and began to
sleep. “But at midnight there was a shout, ‘Behold, the bridegroom! Come out to
meet him.’ “Then all those virgins rose and trimmed their lamps. “The foolish
said to the prudent, ‘Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.’ “But
the prudent answered, ‘No, there will not be enough for us and you too; go
instead to the dealers and buy some for yourselves.’ “And while they were going
away to make the purchase, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went
in with him to the wedding feast; and the door was shut. “Later the other
virgins also came, saying, ‘Lord, lord, open up for us.’ “But he answered, ‘Truly
I say to you, I do not know you.’ “Be on the alert then, for you do not know
the day nor the hour.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 25:1-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The parable of the sheep and the goats is found in Matthew
25:31-34 and Matthew 25:41-46. The sheep are the Gentile believers who will go
into the Millennium. The goats are Gentile unbelievers who will be taken in
judgment.</p>

<p class=Verses>““But when the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the
angels with Him, then He will sit on His glorious throne. “All the nations will
be gathered before Him; and He will separate them from one another, as the
shepherd separates the sheep from the goats; and He will put the sheep on His
right, and the goats on the left. “Then the King will say to those on His
right, ‘Come, you who are blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared
for you from the foundation of the world.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 25:31-34, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““Then He will also say to those on His left, ‘Depart from Me,
accursed ones, into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and
his angels; for I was hungry, and you gave Me nothing to eat; I was thirsty,
and you gave Me nothing to drink; I was a stranger, and you did not invite Me
in; naked, and you did not clothe Me; sick, and in prison, and you did not
visit Me.’ “Then they themselves also will answer, ‘Lord, when did we see You
hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not
take care of You?’ “Then He will answer them, ‘Truly I say to you, to the
extent that you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it
to Me.’ “These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into
eternal life.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 25:41-46, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The parable of the talent test is found in Matthew
25:14-30. The men who were given five and two talents each represent those
Jewish believers who will go into the Millenn­ium. The man given one talent represents
unsaved Jews who will go into judgment.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Baptism of Fire from the standpoint of the Gentiles
is in Mathew 25:31-­46, where “nations” represent Gentiles.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;For it is just like a man about to go on a journey,
who called his own slaves and entrusted his possessions to them. &quot;To one
he gave five talents, to another, two, and to another, one, each according to
his own ability; and he went on his journey.&quot;  (Matthew 25:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;The one who had received the five talents came up
and brought five more talents, saying, 'Master, you entrusted five talents to
me. See, I have gained five more talents.' &quot;His master said to him, 'Well
done, good and faithful slave. You were faithful with a few things, I will put
you in charge of many things; enter into the joy of your master.'&quot; 
(Matthew 25:20-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Also the one who had received the two talents came
up and said, 'Master, you entrusted two talents to me. See, I have gained two
more talents.' &quot;His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful
slave. You were faithful with a few things, I will put you in charge of many
things; enter into the joy of your master.'&quot;  (Matthew 25:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;And the one also who had received the one talent
came up and said, 'Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did
not sow and gathering where you scattered no seed. 'And I was afraid, and went
away and hid your talent in the ground. See, you have what is yours.' &quot;But
his master answered and said to him, 'You wicked, lazy slave, you knew that I
reap where I did not sow and gather where I scattered no seed.&quot;  (Matthew
25:24-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Baptism of Fire from the standpoint of the Jews is in
the Matthew 24 and 25 passages mentioned above, plus Ezekiel 20:32-38. When the
Jews are brought back into the Land, the unbelieving Jews will be judged and
cast off the earth and the born-again Jews will go into the Millennium.</p>

<p class=Verses>““What comes into your mind will not come about, when you say: ‘We
will be like the nations, like the tribes of the lands, serving wood and stone.’
“As I live,” declares the Lord GOD, “surely with a mighty hand and with an
outstretched arm and with wrath poured out, I shall be king over you. “I will
bring you out from the peoples and gather you from the lands where you are
scattered, with a mighty hand and with an outstretched arm and with wrath
poured out; and I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there
I will enter into judgment with you face to face. “As I entered into judgment
with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will enter into
judgment with you,” declares the Lord GOD. “I will make you pass under the rod,
and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant; and I will purge from you
the rebels and those who transgress against Me; I will bring them out of the
land where they sojourn, but they will not enter the land of Israel. Thus you
will know that I am the LORD.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ezekiel 20:32-38, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All unbelievers will be cast off the earth and will join
the rest of the unbelievers in Torments (Sheol-Hades-Hell) to await the Last
Judgment in Rev. 20 otherwise known as The Great White Throne Judgment. Revelation
20:13 speaks of “every one of them” who probably will be given some type of “resurrection
unto damnation” body.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and
Hades gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged, every one of
them according to their deeds.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation 20:13, NASB)</p>
