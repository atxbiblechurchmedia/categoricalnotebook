<h2><a name="_D-Book_of_Life"></a><a name="_Book_of_Life"></a>Book of Life and
Book of Works</h2>

<p class=Verses> “For whatever is born of God overcomes the world; and this is
the victory that has overcome the world—our faith. Who is the one who overcomes
the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
John 5:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that
we might become the righteousness of God in Him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Corinthians
5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Book of Life</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is sovereign and can do whatsoever He pleases. He was
pleased to give man free will. Psalms 135:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Whatever the LORD pleases, He does, In heaven and in earth, in
the seas and in all deeps.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 135:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is also absolute righteousness (+R) and justice and
can do nothing wrong. He is also always fair. Christ died for the sins of the
whole world. He purchased everyone. 1 John 2:2; Ezek. 18:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins; and not for
ours only, but also for those of the whole world.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 John 2:2,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““Behold, all souls are Mine; the soul of the father as well as
the soul of the son is Mine. The soul who sins will die.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ezekiel
18:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Therefore, the name of every member of the human race is
written in the Book of Life when they receive physical life at the point of
birth. Believers’ names remain in the Book of Life. Believers names are not ever
blotted out. Phil. 4:3; Rev. 3:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Indeed, true companion, I ask you also to help these women who
have shared my struggle in the cause of the gospel, together with Clement also
and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Philippians
4:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“‘He who overcomes will thus be clothed in white garments; and
I will not erase his name from the book of life, and I will confess his name
before My Father and before His angels.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation 3:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Unbelievers’ names are blotted out at physical death because
they have not accepted Jesus Christ as their Savior. In Exodus 32:32, Moses had
his back up at God. In Exodus 32:33, the phrase “sinned against Me” refers to
the “unpardonable sin” which is rejection of Jesus Christ. Psalms 69:27-28.</p>

<p class=Verses>““But now, if You will, forgive their sin—and if not, please
blot me out from Your book which You have written!” The LORD said to Moses, “Whoever
has sinned against Me, I will blot him out of My book.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Exodus
32:32-33, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Add iniquity to their iniquity, And may they not come into
Your righteousness. May they be blotted out of the book of life And may they
not be recorded with the righteous.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 69:27-28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Dead unbelievers are not in the Book of Life. They will
be judged at the Great White Throne Judgment. Rev. 20:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And if anyone’s name was not found written in the book of
life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation 20:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Revelation 13:8 and Revelation 17:8 indicates that during
the Tribulation, those that accept the mark of the Beast terminate their chance
to change their mind about Christ - the same as physical death.</p>

<p class=Verses>“All who dwell on the earth will worship him, everyone whose
name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life
of the Lamb who has been slain.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation 13:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to come
up out of the abyss and go to destruction. And those who dwell on the earth,
whose name has not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the
world, will wonder when they see the beast, that he was and is not and will
come.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation 17:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Your name is entered into the Book of Life when you
receive physical life - at birth. Your name stays in the Book of Life if you
accept Jesus Christ as your Savior, thus receiving God’s eternal life before
physical death.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are three categories of individuals: A normal
person who reaches the age of accountability, a normal person who hasn’t
reached the age of accountability, and a person with an abnormally low IQ regardless
of age. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>At Death</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the point of physical death, the normal person who has
reached the age of accountability, but has rejected Jesus Christ as Savior, their
name is blotted out of the Book of Life and is written into the Book of Works.
Rev. 3:5; Psalms 69:28. </p>

<p class=Verses>“‘He who overcomes will thus be clothed in white garments; and
I will not erase his name from the book of life, and I will confess his name
before My Father and before His angels.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation 3:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“May they be blotted out of the book of life And may they not
be recorded with the righteous.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 69:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the point of physical death of a normal person who has
not yet reaching the age of accountability, their name stays in the Book of
Life. If such a person lives to reach the age of accountability, they continue
to stay in the Book of Life although they are unsaved. God’s grace is for their
name to stay in the Book of Life until the final moment of death. If that
person dies without accepting Jesus Christ as their Savior, their name is then blotted
out at the point of death.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For the person with an abnormally low IQ, their name
stays in the Book of Life as their volition will never be normally operative.
At death, their name stays in the Book of Life because of God’s perfect righteousness
(+R) and Justice. Jesus Christ purchased all of the human race from the slave
market of sin. The only issue will always be your volition or free will. As
long as you are alive you have a choice. Gen. 6:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD said, “My Spirit shall not strive with man
forever, because he also is flesh; nevertheless his days shall be one hundred
and twenty years.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis 6:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>At the Rapture of the Church</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All Church Age believers will meet Jesus Christ in the
air at the Rapture. Unbelievers remain on the earth to go through the
Tribulation. There will be much evangelism during the Tribulation. If one or
both parents are believers and have either a normal child who has not yet
reached the age of accountability or a child with abnormally low IQ, these
children will meet Jesus Christ in the air along with their believing parents. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If both parents are unbelievers, the children will stay
with the parents under the concept of Divine Institution #3 (Family) and will
hear the Gospel during the Tribulation. The normal child may or may not accept Jesus
Christ as their Savior.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For children with abnormally low IQ, it is not possible
to evangelize them in the Tribulation because they can never reach
God-consciousness. Because God is always fair and has absolute righteousness (+R)
and Justice, these children always have an eternal future with God in heaven.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>At the Second Advent</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If the normal person has accepted Jesus Christ during the
Tribulation, they will go into the Millennium in a physical body and replenish
the earth. There will be a great population at the end of the Millennium. Rev.
20:8. </p>

<p class=Verses>“and will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four
corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for the war; the
number of them is like the sand of the seashore.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation 20:8,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The child who has not reached accountability in the
Tribulation will go into the Millennium where they will have a chance to accept
Christ as Savior. If the person with abnormally low IQ has not died in the
Tribulation and gone to be with the Lord, they will be given a resurrection
body with Jewish Age believers or God will perform a miracle to restore
sufficient mental capability to exercise volition and they will have
opportunity to accept the Lord Jesus Christ in the Millennium.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Book of Works</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Book of Works contains the names of all unbelievers
along with every good deed they have ever done. Unbelievers’ good deeds are the
only things mentioned at the Last Judgment. Rev. 20:11-15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat upon it, from
whose presence earth and heaven fled away, and no place was found for them. And
I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books
were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life; and the
dead were judged from the things which were written in the books, according to
their deeds. And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and Hades
gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged, every one of them
according to their deeds. Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of
fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire. And if anyone’s name was not
found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation
20:11-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Good works are the basis of indictment of unbelievers.
The unbeliever will stand before the Lord Jesus Christ and will attempt to
match their good works against Christ’s perfect salvation work on the Cross. God,
in His absolute righteousness (+R) and justice, evaluates these good works and
they will not measure up. Isaiah 64:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For all of us have become like one who is unclean, And all our
righteous deeds are like a filthy garment; And all of us wither like a leaf,
And our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah 64:6,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Their free will rejection of the Lord Jesus Christ as
their Savior sends them to the Lake of Fire for eternity. </p>
