<h2>The Physical Body</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The physical body is a house or tabernacle in which we
live while on earth. 2 Corinthians 5:6-8 speaks of the body as a structure,
which we vacate when we die physically and where we are at home when we are
alive physically.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, being always of good courage, and knowing that
while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord— for we walk by
faith, not by sight— we are of good courage, I say, and prefer rather to be
absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2
Corinthians 5:6-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The real you is what lives inside of the body - the soul.
The Church Age believer’s body is the temple (tabernacle) of the Holy Spirit where
the Holy Spirit indwells. 1 Cor. 6:19; John 14:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy
Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and that you are not your own?”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Corinthians 6:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Helper,
that He may be with you forever;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 14:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer will be rewarded at the Judgment Seat of
Christ for things done while filled with the Holy Spirit (in fellowship with
God) while living in their physical body. 2 Cor. 5:10. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so
that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body, according to what
he has done, whether good or bad.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Corinthians 5:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our bodies are going to be changed when we receive our
resurrection bodies. The resurrection body will not have an old sin nature and will
not be able to produce human good. Phil. 3:21. </p>

<p class=Verses>“who will transform the body of our humble state into
conformity with the body of His glory, by the exertion of the power that He has
even to subject all things to Himself.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Philippians 3:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are told to keep our body in good physical shape and
under control in 1 Corinthians 9:27. Don’t let a personable habit take away
your volition. Matthew 6:25 tells us that we are to not be worried about our
body. We are to claim God's promises we have for time. We are to live in the
Word and be occupied with the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but I discipline my body and make it my slave, so that, after
I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Corinthians 9:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““For this reason I say to you, do not be worried about your
life, as to what you will eat or what you will drink; nor for your body, as to
what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than
clothing?”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 6:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The things mentioned in Matthew 6:25 are the details of
life - God’s Word or Bible doctrine should be first. We are not to be unduly
occupied with temporal needs. Phil. 4:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And my God will supply all your needs according to His riches
in glory in Christ Jesus.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Philippians 4:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This does not mean that we do not tend to life’s details.
We operate under the four Divine Institutions set up by God. The big things in
life are the filling of the Holy Spirit, faith-rest, occupation with Christ,
living in the Word, and erection of the edification complex of the soul. All
other things are details. God does not coerce man’s volition. When we worry and
try to solve our own problems, He lets us. When we turn them over to Him, they
get solved. The policy is grace. Isaiah 30:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore the LORD longs to be gracious to you, And therefore
He waits on high to have compassion on you. For the LORD is a God of justice;
How blessed are all those who long for Him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah 30:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The body is involved in marriage. Sexual death is in the
body. Fornication is a sin against the body. 1 Cor. 7:4; Rom. 4:19; 1 Cor. 6:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the
husband does; and likewise also the husband does not have authority over his
own body, but the wife does.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 7:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Without becoming weak in faith he contemplated his own body,
now as good as dead since he was about a hundred years old, and the deadness of
Sarah’s womb;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 4:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Flee immorality. Every other sin that a man commits is outside
the body, but the immoral man sins against his own body.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Corinthians 6:18, NASB)</p>
