<h2><a name="_Volition_of_Man"></a><a name="_Volition"></a>Volition, Divine
Institution #1</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Volition is free will or self-determination. Volition is
the right to decide to be either dependent upon God or to act independently of
Him. Each member of the human race has the personal authority to make their own
decisions and to be responsible for those decisions. This authority of your
volition should give you confidence in your own decisions. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For example, Adam and Eve in the Garden made a decision
to be married. In Genesis 2-3, the animals were named by Adam and choices were
made in the Garden as to the forbidden fruit. They both decided based on their
own free will to disobey God's singular mandate to not eat the fruit on a
single tree in the Garden. This single command from God was the very first time
in human history that volition became an issue. Gen. 2:16-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD God commanded the man, saying, &quot;From any tree of
the garden you may eat freely; but from the tree of the knowledge of good and
evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat from it you will surely
die.&quot;” (Genesis 2:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Under maximum freedom under innocence in the Garden,
there was but one law - “From any tree of the garden you may eat freely; but
from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat.” Under
maximum freedom, there are laws to be respected. The Ten Commandments were
given from God to the Israelites as a Magna Carta of human freedom. Exodus
20:2-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land
of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. &quot;You shall have no other gods
before Me.” (Exodus 20:2-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The soul is made up of self-consciousness, mentality,
emotion, and volition as the authority of the soul. Our soul’s authority is
called volition or free will or self-determination. Your decisions and choices
determine the life that you will lead. Volition provides each of us the
authority to obey or disobey when given a choice. With your personal choices
comes responsibility for the consequences for those decisions, intended or
unintended. Your volition is your authority to make good decisions from a position
of strength or bad decisions from a position of weakness.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The most critical choices in life are whether to accept
or reject the existence of God (God-consciousness) and then to either accept or
reject the work of Jesus Christ on the Cross for the sins of mankind. Following
those positive volition decisions, the believer’s decisions determine the level
of spiritual growth that they will attain in this life. For the ones who reject
the existence of God and then reject the work of Jesus Christ on the Cross,
their eternal path remains unchanged – the Lake of Fire. John 3:36.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who
does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on
him.&quot;” (John 3:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Human freedom cannot exist without privacy and authority. We
must have freedom and privacy for the proper function our free will. This is
why the laws of divine establishment are so important. However, it is still
possible to exercise spiritual freedom while under a loss of human freedom such
as living under slavery. For example, in the Roman Empire, slaves were
generally free to come and go and could still be evangelized and grow
spiritually. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/D/Divine%20Institutions.html">Divine
