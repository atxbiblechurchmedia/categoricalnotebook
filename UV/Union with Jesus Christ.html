<h2><a name="_Union_with_Christ"></a><a name="_Union_with_Jesus"></a>Union with
Jesus Christ</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Every believer in the Church Age is placed into union with
Jesus Christ at the moment of salvation by the Holy Spirit. This is not
optional! It does not occur after salvation. In Ephesians 4:5, the word “baptism”
means to be identified with. We become identified with the Lord Jesus Christ at
the point of salvation. As a result of being in union with Christ, we share
what Christ has. We share His eternal life, His righteousness, His destiny, His
election, and His royalty. We are identified with the Lord Jesus Christ as He
is seated at the Father's right hand. This is called Positional Truth. See
category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/P/Positional%20Truth.html">Positional Truth</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;one Lord, one faith, one baptism,&quot;  (Ephesians 4:5,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 12:13, “we were all baptized” means that
all are baptized, not just some. The phrase “For by one Spirit we were all
baptized into one body” means the Holy Spirit did all the work and we all
become members of the Body of Christ. All Church Age believers were baptized by
one Spirit into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, slaves or free. The phrase
“we were all made to drink of one Spirit” refers to the indwelling of the Holy
Spirit. Gal. 3:26-28.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body,
whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink
of one Spirit.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 12:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ
Jesus. For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves
with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free
man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ
Jesus.&quot;  (Galatians 3:26-28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The believer’s union with Christ resulting from the Baptism
of the Holy Spirit is permanent. You can never get out. There is no sin or evil
you can do that will separate you from Christ. Not even God can do this because
He is immutable and cannot change His perfect decisions. The Baptism of the
Spirit is the unifying factor in the Body of Christ. We have equal privilege
and opportunity to execute God's plan for our lives. See category on <a
href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/E/Eternal%20Security.html">Eternal Security</a>. See category on <a
href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/B/Baptism%20of%20the%20Holy%20Spirit.html">Baptism of the Holy Spirit</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When we are placed into union with Christ, we become “a new
creature” referring to our new birth when we received our human spirit
(regeneration). “The old things passed away” referring to our spiritual death
and “new things have come” referring to our unique spiritual life. 2 Cor. 5:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creature; the
old things passed away; behold, new things have come.” (2 Corinthians 5:17,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We have distinctions removed. Racial distinctions are
removed. We are “neither Jew nor Greek.” Social distinctions are removed. We
are “neither slave nor free man.” Sexual distinctions are removed. We are “neither
male nor female.” Women have equality with men under Christianity. Gal.
3:26-28.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. For
all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.
There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is
neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.” (Galatians
3:26-28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>We Share Nine Things With Jesus Christ </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Because of the Church Age believer’s union with Christ, we
share nine things that Jesus Christ possesses. Jesus Christ is eternal life, therefore
we share His life. 1 John 5:11-12; John 1:12. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And the testimony is this, that God has given us eternal life,
and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has the life; he who does not
have the Son of God does not have the life.” (1 John 5:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to
become children of God, even to those who believe in His name,” (John 1:12,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is absolute righteousness (+R), therefore we
have His absolute righteousness (+R). 2 Cor 5:21. </p>

<p class=Verses>“He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that
we might become the righteousness of God in Him.” (2 Corinthians 5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is the Son of God, therefore we share His Sonship.
Gal. 3:26. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.”
(Galatians 3:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is the heir of God, therefore we are
joint-heirs with Him. Rom. 8:16-17; 1 Peter 1:4-5. </p>

<p class=Verses>“The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are
children of God, and if children, heirs also, heirs of God and fellow heirs
with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him so that we may also be glorified with
Him.” (Romans 8:16-17, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“to obtain an inheritance which is imperishable and undefiled
and will not fade away, reserved in heaven for you, who are protected by the
power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last
time.” (1 Peter 1:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ has a Kingship, therefore we share His
Kingship. Rev 1:6. </p>

<p class=Verses>“and He has made us to be a kingdom, priests to His God and
Father—to Him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen.”
(Revelation 1:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is our High Priest, therefore every Church
Age believer is a priest and therefore, represents themselves directly before
God. 1 Peter 2:5; 1 Peter 2:9. </p>

<p class=Verses>“you also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual
house for a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
through Jesus Christ.” (1 Peter 2:5, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“But you are A CHOSEN RACE, A royal PRIESTHOOD, A HOLY NATION,
A PEOPLE FOR God's OWN POSSESSION, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of
Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;” (1 Peter 2:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is sanctified (set apart unto God), so we
are sanctified. 1 Cor. 1:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“To the church of God which is at Corinth, to those who have
been sanctified in Christ Jesus, saints by calling, with all who in every place
call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours:” (1 Corinthians
1:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is elected forever, therefore we share His
election. 1 Peter 1:2; Eph. 1:4; Col. 3:12; Rom. 8:28-33.</p>

<p class=Verses>“according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by the
sanctifying work of the Spirit, to obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with His
blood: May grace and peace be yours in the fullest measure.” (1 Peter 1:2,
NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world,
that we would be holy and blameless before Him. In love” (Ephesians 1:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So, as those who have been chosen of God, holy and beloved,
put on a heart of compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Colossians
3:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And we know that God causes all things to work together for
good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.
For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the
image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many brethren; and
these whom He predestined, He also called; and these whom He called, He also
justified; and these whom He justified, He also glorified. What then shall we
say to these things? If God is for us, who is against us? He who did not spare
His own Son, but delivered Him over for us all, how will He not also with Him
freely give us all things? Who will bring a charge against God’s elect? God is
the one who justifies;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 8:28-33, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is predestined, therefore we share His
destiny. Eph. 1:5; Eph. 1:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to
Himself, according to the kind intention of His will,” (Ephesians 1:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“also we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined
according to His purpose who works all things after the counsel of His will,”
(Ephesians 1:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Christ is one with the Father, therefore, because of our
union with Christ, we have the Father as well as the Son. 1 John 2:23; John 14:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Whoever denies the Son does not have the Father; the one who
confesses the Son has the Father also.” (1 John 2:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and
you in Me, and I in you.” (John 14:20, NASB)</p>
