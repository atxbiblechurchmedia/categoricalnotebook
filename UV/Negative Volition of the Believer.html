<h2>Negative Volition of the Believer</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer becomes negative to Bible doctrine from
their free will. There is a continual struggle in the soul for control. Either your
soul is controlled 100% by the Holy Spirit (spirituality) or 100% controlled by
your old sin nature (carnality). </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer can choose to confess their sins to God the
Father or choose to remain in carnality.  God administers divine discipline to
make the issue clear that they should confess their sins and be restored to
fellowship with God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer will need to choose to consistently take in
the teaching of the Word of God and thereby grow spiritually. The believer can
also choose to do other things as higher priorities over Bible doctrine intake
and fail to grow.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As the believer grows spiritually, God will bring testing
to accelerate their spiritual growth by relying solely on His grace resources
to deals with the test. If the believer stays with God's grace resources and
the Bible doctrine in their soul, they will pass the test. If they choose to
use their own human abilities in carnality, they will fail the test. See
category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/T/Testing.html">Testing</a>. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Rejection of Authority and Soul Conflict</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 6:16, “Do you not know” is the perfect active
indicative of <span lang=EL>οι</span>̓͂<span lang=EL>δα</span> (oida) and means
to know, to realize, to recognize, to understand. The perfect tense is used as
a dramatic present and refers to Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the soul ready
to be applied. This indicates that the believer has functioned or should have
functioned to this point under the grace apparatus for perception to grow
spiritually. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Do you not know that when you present yourselves to someone as
slaves for obedience, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin
resulting in death, or of obedience resulting in righteousness?” (Romans 6:16,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“That when” is a neuter relative pronoun that indicates
we are dealing with a principle of authority in the soul of the believer. One
reason why some people have unstable souls is that all their lives they have
rejected authority. They have rejected the authority of Bible doctrine in their
soul. Why? The constant rejection of Bible doctrine allows the emotions to
dominate the right lobe of the soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Brilliant women who founded cults rejected authority all of
their lives. For example, Mary Baker Eddy who founded the Church of Christ,
Scientist rejected the authority of her husbands. If you have enough
information you can see the rejection of authority and the pattern of their
emotions became the pattern of their cult. You can also see that in Aimee Semple
McPherson who founded the Foursquare Church.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>That is also why so many cults are anti-nationalism and anti-freedom.
Another example is Mormonism in its founders Joseph Smith and Brigham Young who
were anti-divine institution # 2 - Marriage. They destroyed biblical marriage through
polygamy. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 6:16, “When you present yourselves” is the present
active indicative of <span lang=EL>παρι</span>́<span lang=EL>στημι</span>
(paristēmi) and means to present or show by argument, to prove. <i>Para</i> is
the preposition of immediate source and <i>histemi</i> means to stand from an
immediate source. It is a verb of volition. It implies that volition is wired
to every part of the soul!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It means to function from the immediate source of the filling
of the Holy Spirit or if in reversionism to function from the immediate source
of the old sin nature. What controls you? If you are a man controlled by your
emotions, you become a woman in your soul, a responder. If you are a woman and
you go into emotional revolt, you become masculine in your soul, an initiator. The
active voice means this is volitional. At first you are free to respond to one
or the other, but this ability can be wiped out. <i>Paristemi</i> is a verb of
volition in recognizing authority. ”Yourselves” is a reflexive pronoun, accusative
plural and is dealing with an inner function.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 6:16, “slaves” is <span lang=EL>δου</span>͂<span
lang=EL>λος</span> (doulos) and refers to a slave with no portfolio. “For obedience”
is <span lang=EL>ει</span>̓<span lang=EL>ς</span><span lang=EL> </span><span
lang=EL>υ</span>̔<span lang=EL>πακοη</span>́ (eis hupakoē) which looks like a
verb, but it is a prepositional phrase. <i>Eis</i> means because of, resulting
in, indicating basis or purpose cause or result. It is a directional
preposition. With the infinitive <i>eis</i> means purpose. <i>Hupakoē</i> is
one of the strongest nouns in the Greek language for recognition of authority.
It should be translated, “resulting in obedience”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Since there are compartments in the soul, there must be
authority in that soul. Your happiness depends on divine design. In marriage
for example, the authority of the husband and wife cannot be a 50-50 deal. It
never was either in divine design or purpose. The husband has been given the
divine authority over his wife in love. Eph. 5:22-23; Eph. 5:33. See category
on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/M/Marriage%20Principles.html">Marriage Principles</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord. For
the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church,
He Himself being the Savior of the body.” (Ephesians 5:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Nevertheless, each individual among you also is to love his
own wife even as himself, and the wife must see to it that she respects her
husband.” (Ephesians 5:33, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In plurality there must be someone with authority!
Self-consciousness is not in charge. It is only aware of what is going on.
Emotion is not in charge because it is designed by God’s plan to be a
responder. The left lobe of the soul is not in charge as it is a staging area whether
human or spiritual knowledge. The right lobe is the ruler or leader of the soul
and has the authority. The volition carries out the commands of the right lobe
of the soul. The old sin nature always wants to control the soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Who is in charge of your soul? Or are you in emotional
revolt? A pastor in emotional revolt won’t level with his people because some
might be offended. Some pastors know the Truth, but they won’t teach it. Why?
Because it might offend someone. The objective is to communicate the Word of
God! It is not a matter of who may be offended or not! It is a matter of what
is Truth! </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As a believer, you are either free or enslaved. If your soul’s
right lobe dominates, you are free. If your old sin nature dominates with
emotions running, you are in slavery! When you have your old sin nature and
your emotions dominating your soul, you are in emotional revolt in your soul
causing unbelievable confusion.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 6:16, “you are slaves” is the present active
indicative of <span lang=EL>εἰμί</span> (eimi) and means you keep on being
slaves. You are designed to be under authority to something, either God or Satan’s
world system. “The one whom you obey” is the present active indicative of <span
lang=EL>υ</span>̔<span lang=EL>πακου</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (hupakouō)
and is the strongest Greek verb for obedience. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Do you not know that when you present yourselves to someone as
slaves for obedience, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin
resulting in death, or of obedience resulting in righteousness?” (Romans 6:16,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 6:16, the conjunctive “either” is there to
express the first of two alternatives. “Of sin” is the genitive of source singular
of <span lang=EL>ἁμαρτία</span> (hamartia) and refers to the old sin nature.
Remember that the old sin nature is wooing emotion and the right lobe is wooing
emotion. Quite a struggle.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Resulting in death” is <span lang=EL>ει</span>̓<span
lang=EL>ς</span><span lang=EL> </span><span lang=EL>θα</span>́<span lang=EL>νατος</span><span
lang=EL> </span>(eis thanatos) and refers to temporal death, being out of
fellowship, carnality. This is the old sin nature dominating, resulting in dead
works. This is a believer out of fellowship! Eph. 5:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason it says, &quot;Awake, sleeper, And arise from
the dead, And Christ will shine on you.&quot;” (Ephesians 5:14, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If the carnality persists even in the face of ever
intensifying divine discipline, it can finally result in God taking the
believer home early – the Sin Unto Death. 1 John 5:16. See category on <a
href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/S/The%20Sin%20Unto%20Death.html">The Sin Unto Death</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If anyone sees his brother committing a sin not leading to
death, he shall ask and God will for him give life to those who commit sin not
leading to death. There is a sin leading to death; I do not say that he should
make request for this.” (1 John 5:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Or of obedience resulting in righteousness?” is <span
lang=EL>υ</span>̔<span lang=EL>πακοη</span>́ (hupakoē) and means obedience,
compliance, submission. Here we have the right kind of authority. You can never
exercise authority until you have learned to be obedient to authority. We have
people in this country who simply cannot accept the authority of the pulpit. Is
it because pastor-teachers are inaccurate or erroneous in their teaching? No. It
is because they reject authority of everyone and are in emotional revolt. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>People in emotional revolt are very subjective in their
thinking. We see this in our country today at every level. It is unbelievable! To
get Bible doctrine into your soul, you must submit to the authority of the
pastor-teacher first and then to the Word of God that is taught. The result is
righteousness in the soul!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Victory In The Soul</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 6:17, “But thanks be to God” means “But grace
to God.” There is no verb. It’s an idiom meaning that God is the answer or the
solution. “That though you were slaves of sin” is the imperfect active
indicative of <span lang=EL>εἰμί</span> (eimi). Sin is in the singular so it
refers to the old sin nature. The imperfect indicates that in the past they
were carnal believers in slavery to the old sin nature. This indicates a
recovery from emotional revolt of the soul. Today, people are living on their
emotions and it rules out common sense and it rules out Bible doctrine. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But thanks be to God that though you were slaves of sin, you
became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching to which you were
committed,” (Romans 6:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“But” is a conjunction of contrast between instability
and soul slavery and establishing stability and strength of soul. “You became
obedient” is <span lang=EL>υ</span>̔<span lang=EL>πακοη</span>́ (hupakoē) and
means to hear, to listen, to concentrate under authority. This is establishing
authority in the soul. There must be authority. Authority is never our enemy. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“From the heart” refers to the three areas being applied,
the filling of the Holy Spirit, the circulation of the Word in the right lobe
of the soul under the grace apparatus for perception, and the application of
Bible doctrine from the soul. “That form of teaching” refers to the system of
teaching Bible doctrine under a prepared categorical pastor-teacher who uses
ICE principles. Doctrine is the word for teaching in public assembly.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“To which you were committed” is the aorist passive
indicative of <span lang=EL>παραδι</span>́<span lang=EL>δωμι</span><span
lang=EL> </span>(paradidōmi) and means to commit, to deliver. You responded to
doctrine and have been delivered into a system of doctrine. A corrected
translation is, “But grace belongs to God, that you were slaves to the old sin
nature but you have obeyed out from the heart as a source, a system of doctrine
into which you have been delivered.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jeremiah 44 describes why women take leadership over from
men. Men got into emotional revolt and would not carry out their responsibilities.
Women filled the authority vacuum created and it became a matriarchal society. Men
who can’t remain authority oriented to strong Bible doctrine become negative
and become  passive, overly sensitive and reactive. Such men become women in
their souls. Women who can’t remain authority oriented to strong Bible doctrine
become aggressive and become masculine in their souls. Your happiness and your
sanity depend upon authority orientation.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But they have not become contrite even to this day, nor
have they feared nor walked in My law or My statutes, which I have set before
you and before your fathers.&quot;' &quot;Therefore thus says the LORD of
hosts, the God of Israel, 'Behold, I am going to set My face against you for
woe, even to cut off all Judah.” (Jeremiah 44:10-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;And,&quot; said the women, &quot;when we were burning
sacrifices to the queen of heaven and were pouring out drink offerings to her,
was it without our husbands that we made for her sacrificial cakes in her image
and poured out drink offerings to her?&quot;” (Jeremiah 44:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;So the LORD was no longer able to endure it, because of
the evil of your deeds, because of the abominations which you have committed;
thus your land has become a ruin, an object of horror and a curse, without an
inhabitant, as it is this day.” (Jeremiah 44:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To be obedient means to be authority oriented to the
teaching of the Word of God. You have to be where doctrine is taught to learn
Bible Doctrine. You must be positive. The teaching must be taught with
authority! The spiritual gift of a pastor-teacher is needed plus academic
preparation and qualification. The pastor-teacher must know the ICE (Isagogics,
Categories, Exegesis) method of hermeneutics and know the original languages of
Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic. Both the pastor-teacher must be filled with the Holy
Spirit and the believer listening must be filled with the Holy Spirit and
functioning under the grace apparatus for perception. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In salvation, the working object of our faith is Jesus
Christ, but in the Christian way of life, the working object of our faith is
Bible doctrine. When Bible doctrine is the working object of the believers
faith, then Bible doctrine goes to work for you, you cease from your own brand
of works. Heb. 4:10; Heb. 4:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the one who has entered His rest has himself also rested
from his works, as God did from His.” (Hebrews 4:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any
two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of
both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the
heart.” (Hebrews 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 6:18, “having been freed” is the aorist passive
participle of <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>λευθερο</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (eleutheroō) and means to make free from the dominion of sin
(the old sin nature). This should be translated, “Having been set free by the
daily function of the grace apparatus for perception, by the proper function of
the right lobe of the soul.” The aorist tense means the believer is taking in
doctrine and building an edification complex in the right lobe of their soul. The
passive voice means the believer receives Bible doctrine and the Bible doctrine
delivers them. The participle sets up the principle that you are then free to
be a slave to God.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and having been freed from sin, you became slaves of
righteousness.” (Romans 6:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“From sin” means from the ultimate source of the old sin
nature. “You became the slaves of righteousness” refers to the <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine in the frame of reference, the conscience and so on. This means
that what the believer thinks is really who they are. Prov. 23:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For as he thinks within himself, so he is. He says to you,
&quot;Eat and drink!&quot; But his heart is not with you.” (Proverbs 23:7,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Solution to the Weakness of the Flesh</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 6:19, “because of the weakness of your flesh”
refers to the old sin nature as mankind’s internal source of temptation to sin.
The flesh is also the source of human good, mental attitude sins, emotional
revolt, lust patterns, etc. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/NO/The%20Old%20Sin%20Nature.html">The Old
Sin Nature</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I am speaking in human terms because of the weakness of your
flesh. For just as you presented your members as slaves to impurity and to
lawlessness, resulting in further lawlessness, so now present your members as
slaves to righteousness, resulting in sanctification.” (Romans 6:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Just as you presented” is the aorist active indicative
of <span lang=EL>παρι</span>́<span lang=EL>στημι</span> (paristēmi) and means
that at a point of time when the believer under the authority of the old sin
nature has an emotional revolt of the soul. They exercise volition to do this.
The active voice means that the believer deliberately sins. Some may say that
they have never sinned since they were saved, but this is impossible. 1 John
1:8. </p>

<p class=Verses>“If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves and
the truth is not in us.” (1 John 1:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Members” is the accusative plural of <span lang=EL>με</span>́<span
lang=EL>λος</span> (melos) and refers to various parts of the soul such as the
self-consciousness, mentality, volition, conscience, and emotions. Sometimes
this Greek word is used for parts of the anatomy. The context always determines!
See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/UV/Volition.html">Volition</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“As slaves to impurity” refers to old sin nature
production. “To lawlessness, resulting in further lawlessness” means anarchy
resulting in further anarchy or revolution that originates in the soul! People
in this condition can find themselves involved in many kinds of anti-government
movements and anarchist movements. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 6:19, “so now present” is again <span lang=EL>παρι</span>́<span
lang=EL>στημι</span> (paristēmi) which is a word of obedience that emphasizes
the use of volition. This word recognizes authority of Bible doctrine in the
right lobe of the soul when the believer is filled with the Holy Spirit and the
Holy Spirit controls their soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The mechanics of “presenting” oneself starts with
confessing your sins to God the Father using 1 John 1:9 that results in the filling
of the Holy Spirit. The believer then listens to the teaching of the Word of
God under the grace apparatus for perception and grows spiritually. The active
voice means you have to make decisions on the basis of Bible doctrine. The
imperative mood means this is a command. You cannot possibly grow spiritually
in any other way. Eph. 5:18. </p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but
be filled with the Spirit,” (Ephesians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 6:19, “slaves to righteousness” is <span
lang=EL>δικαιοσυ</span>́<span lang=EL>νη</span><span lang=EL> </span>(dikaiosunē)
and refers to righteousness produced from <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in
the soul. This condition of spirituality can only exist under the enabling
power of the Holy Spirit. The believer can learn Bible doctrine only under
these conditions. We are commanded to take in the Word of God daily, with
positive volition, filled with the Holy Spirit, functioning under the grace
apparatus for perception, resulting in spiritual growth which produces a divine
viewpoint toward life and the world around you. Jer. 20:12;Rom 12:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Yet, O LORD of hosts, You who test the righteous, Who see the
mind and the heart; Let me see Your vengeance on them; For to You I have set
forth my cause.” (Jeremiah 20:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by
the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that
which is good and acceptable and perfect.” (Romans 12:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Resulting in sanctification” is <span lang=EL>ει</span>̓<span
lang=EL>ς</span><span lang=EL> </span><span lang=EL>α</span>̔<span lang=EL>γιασμο</span>́<span
lang=EL>ς</span> (eis hagiasmos) and refers to experiential sanctification. A corrected
translation is, “Even so now present your soul essence as a slave to
righteousness resulting in experiential righteousness.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Pre-Salvation Slavery of the Believer</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 6:20, “For when you were slaves of sin” refers
to the believer’s pre-salvation status. “You were” is the imperfect active
indicative of <span lang=EL>εἰμί</span> (eimi) indicating pre-salvation status
as a slave to the old sin nature. For the unbeliever, common sense is the only
soul stability in the unbeliever’s frame of reference. Morality keeps scar
tissue off of the soul, but is a builder of self-righteousness. Functioning
according to the divine institutions and the laws of divine establishment
restrains a society. For weaker individuals, usually this is restraint is
through ostracism and restraint of the rule of law which restrains through
function and punishment.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to
righteousness.” (Romans 6:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Actually the unbeliever has no defense against the old
sin nature! The laws of divine establishment and the divine institutions enables
the human race to continue and perpetuate itself. “You were free in regard to
righteousness” means that as an unbeliever, there is no confession of sin and
no filling of the Holy Spirit. Unbelievers have no human spirit, so there is no
learning or understanding of spiritual things. Unbelievers have no stability
from <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the soul because they
have none.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When a growing believer look back at their way of living
and way of thinking before Bible doctrine, they can be ashamed of what they
were and how they were thinking. They should use such reflective moments to
realize how much their thinking has been changed by the Holy Spirit and the
accumulation of Bible doctrine in the soul causing spiritual growth. Rom. 6:21;
Rom. 12:2. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore what benefit were you then deriving from the things
of which you are now ashamed? For the outcome of those things is death.”
(Romans 6:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by
the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that
which is good and acceptable and perfect.” (Romans 12:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual growth brings a change of norms and standards,
of frame of reference and viewpoint. <i>Epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the
right lobe of the soul causes a dramatic change of content and thinking. “For
the outcome of those things is death” refers to the second death at the Great
White Throne Judgment.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Post-Salvation Deliverance of the Believer</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 6:22, “But now having been freed from sin” is
the aorist active participle of <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>λευθερο</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (eleutheroō) and means to make free, to liberate. The
participle should be “having been set free.” The conjunction of contrast plus
the adverb indicates that the status of salvation in contrast to the former
state makes a difference in principle! We as believers are “enslaved to God”
and keep on deriving our benefit resulting in sanctification and eternal life. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But now having been freed from sin and enslaved to God, you
derive your benefit, resulting in sanctification, and the outcome, eternal
life.” (Romans 6:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Contrast in Status</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 6:23, “For the wages of sin is death” means the
wages earned by the old sin nature brings only spiritual death in time and
spiritual death for eternity – the Second Death or the Great White Throne
Judgment. This is the unbeliever exercising their free will to reject the work
of Jesus Christ on the Cross. They are free to have negative volition and emotional
revolt. “But the free gift of God” is pure grace, unearned favor from God
received from the simple act of faith alone in Jesus Christ alone for
salvation. This free gift cannot ever be earned in contrast to the wages of the
old sin nature which must be earned. God's grace gift is eternal life in Jesus
Christ our Lord.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is
eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Romans 6:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The unbeliever’s eternal destination in the Lake of Fire is
earned and deserved by their rejection of the work of Jesus Christ for all
mankind. The believer’s eternal destination in heaven face-to-face with the
Lord is never earned or deserved – it is grace! Hell depends upon the work of
man. Heaven depends upon the work of Christ. Rom. 4:4; Jer. 20:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now to the one who works, his wage is not credited as a favor,
but as what is due.” (Romans 4:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Yet, O LORD of hosts, You who test the righteous, Who see the
mind and the heart; Let me see Your vengeance on them; For to You I have set
forth my cause.” (Jeremiah 20:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Negative Volition Causes</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Negative volition of the believer is the road to ruin and
begins with apathy toward some category of Bible doctrine. A lack of interest
in certain subjects causes you to tune out. You feel that certain doctrines are
contrary to your background. You feel that certain doctrines will cause a
change in your routine of living and that is just not acceptable. You just are
not going to change!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Negative volition is caused also by personality conflicts
or antagonism with regard to the pastor-teacher. The pastor says to come to
class whenever it is held, but you don’t want do it. You have many more
important priorities than the intake of the Word of God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Negative volition of the believer is also caused by
antagonism or mental attitude sins toward other members in the congregation.
They have violated your norms or standards. They have thought you had an axe to
grind. They have made a statement in your field of education and since you are
an expert in the area, only you can make a remark in that area.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Negative volition is caused by failure to confess your
known sins to God the Father on a regular basis. When you are out of fellowship,
nothing but negative volition and scar tissue can be perpetuated.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Negative volition is also caused by slavery to the
details of life. You have a certain amount of time to get your house in order,
and if you don’t, you actually become an enemy of the work.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Negative volition is caused by the inability to cope with
prosperity. You allow prosperity or the lack of it to be your gauge as to
whether you need doctrine. In trouble, you hit Bible class. In prosperity, you
have no time and have to prop up your prosperity to keep going.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Negative volition leads to the emotional revolt of the
soul. When the old sin nature teams up with emotions and subjectivity, the
believer rejects the authority of the Bible doctrine in their soul. With the
old sin nature controlling the soul, only human good, sin, and evil can be
produced. This can involve personal sins such as mental attitude sins, verbal sins,
and overt sins. This can involve lasciviousness or legalism. This can involve lust
patterns such as approbation, power, sex, and so on. See category on <a
href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/NO/The%20Old%20Sin%20Nature.html">The Old Sin Nature</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The result of negative volition toward Bible doctrine is
scar tissue formed on the left bank of the soul. The result is a soul vacuum
into which is pulled false doctrine. On the right bank of the soul, the lust
pattern gets mental attitude sins going. It is expressed through scar tissue
and revenge tactics. As sins are committed from the temptation from the old sin
nature, terrible guilt complexes start up in the conscience. You crank out
human good to quiet the guilt, but it only generates more guilt. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The only way to remove the scar tissue is by confessing
known sins to God the Father that results in the filling of the Holy Spirit. Only
then can the Holy Spirit control the soul. Bible doctrine can now be learned
which removes the scar tissue by replacing it with <i>epignosis</i> Bible
doctrine in the right lobe of the soul. The rebuilding of the edification
complex of the soul is now in progress. See categories on <a
