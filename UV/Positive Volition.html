<h2><a name="_Categorical_Development_of"></a>Positive Volition</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Positive volition is the believer’s free will decision to
follow the instruction and mandates of the Word of God as taught by their
pastor-teacher. It is an act of authority orientation toward the divine
authority of Scripture. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Job 5:8, “I would seek” is the qal imperfect of the
verb <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>דּרשׁ</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(dârash) and is an
expression of continuous positive volition for Bible doctrine. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But as for me, I would seek God, And I would place my
cause before God;” (Job 5:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Those who just won’t miss the consistent intake of Bible
doctrine regardless of what is going on in their life know they need that
spiritual food more than they need physical food. Job 23:12; Matt. 4:4. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I have not departed from the command of His lips; I have
treasured the words of His mouth more than my necessary food.” (Job 23:12,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But He answered and said, &quot;It is written, 'MAN SHALL NOT
LIVE ON BREAD ALONE, BUT ON EVERY WORD THAT PROCEEDS OUT OF THE MOUTH OF
GOD.'&quot;” (Matthew 4:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Matthew 4:4 deals with those who have positive volition
toward the Word on a daily basis. This is the doctrine of living one day at a
time. They live one day at a time and they are positive every day. True
positive volition will always give the individual the desire to have face to
face teaching of Bible doctrine on a daily basis. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Pseudo-Positive Volition</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To be positive because you are inspired at some point is
no good! Either one has positive volition or one does not. Many types of
attitudes appear to be positive volition, but they have the wrong motivation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The inspirational emotional type appears to be positive. These
are the “instant inspiration” crowd. These are the type that say, “I love face
to face teaching, Oh how I love it, I realize it is so important.” They talk
this way for a while and then fade out. Instant inspiration means because of
something, they suddenly realize their need for face to face teaching of Bible
doctrine. Realizing that need, they come to Bible class once or twice or maybe three
or four times. Then something else happens that causes them to fade out, then suddenly
they’re back. You cannot build an edification complex of the soul this way. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The trouble crowd may also appear to be positive to Bible
doctrine. These are the people who always turn positive when they start having
trouble. When disaster or catastrophe comes along, they look for a quick
solution or an easy out. They want God to “stop it from hurting.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The bribery type also appear to be positive. Some go to Bible
class to get a skirt. This is sexual pseudo positive volition. They trade some
attendance at the local church for a woman. Some go to class to make a business
deal go through. They trade some attendance for monetary pseudo positive
volition. Some go to Bible class as an expression of verbal appreciation. They
are coming out just to make sure that God is on their side. They are only
interested in doctrine as long as God is to them a genie. These are people
generally on the verge of prosperity. As the prosperity expands and develops,
they lose interest in doctrine. Once they are sure they have prosperity, then
they fade away.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The failure crowd also may appear to be positive. These
are people who have lost all. They have reached the end of their rope such as a
loss of a job, or living with an alcoholic spouse, or some great shock, or
involvement with drugs, or the loss of someone who they really loved, or loss
of a child. They attend Bible class for a short time because they realize that
the bottom has dropped out of their life. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Positive Volition in Production From the Book of Ezra</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God stirred the spirit for production. Ezra 1:1; Ezra
1:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, in order
to fulfill the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, the LORD stirred up
the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he sent a proclamation throughout
all his kingdom, and also put it in writing, saying:&quot;  (Ezra 1:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then the heads of fathers' households of Judah and
Benjamin and the priests and the Levites arose, even everyone whose spirit God
had stirred to go up and rebuild the house of the LORD which is in
Jerusalem.&quot;  (Ezra 1:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Positive volition in production is always expressed under
a proper constituted authority. Ezra 1:2-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Thus says Cyrus king of Persia, 'The LORD, the God
of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and He has appointed me
to build Him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. 'Whoever there is among
you of all His people, may his God be with him! Let him go up to Jerusalem
which is in Judah and rebuild the house of the LORD, the God of Israel; He is
the God who is in Jerusalem. 'Every survivor, at whatever place he may live,
let the men of that place support him with silver and gold, with goods and
cattle, together with a freewill offering for the house of God which is in
Jerusalem.'&quot;&quot;  (Ezra 1:2-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Positive volition in production first has a stirred
spirit, but secondly, it takes steps in preparation for the task. Ezra 1:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;All those about them encouraged them with articles of
silver, with gold, with goods, with cattle and with valuables, aside from all
that was given as a freewill offering.&quot;  (Ezra 1:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Positive volition in production when preparing doesn’t
skimp. Over preparation is better than under preparation. Positive volition in
production not only prepares, but freely gives in grace from that provision.
Ezra 2:68-70.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Some of the heads of fathers' households, when they
arrived at the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem, offered willingly for
the house of God to restore it on its foundation. According to their ability
they gave to the treasury for the work 61,000 gold drachmas and 5,000 silver
minas and 100 priestly garments. Now the priests and the Levites, some of the
people, the singers, the gatekeepers and the temple servants lived in their
cities, and all Israel in their cities.&quot;  (Ezra 2:68-70, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Positive volition in production involves the
establishment of proper worship. The believer’s fellowship is paramount in the
face of and with a view to production. Ezra 3:1-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now when the seventh month came, and the sons of Israel
were in the cities, the people gathered together as one man to Jerusalem. Then
Jeshua the son of Jozadak and his brothers the priests, and Zerubbabel the son
of Shealtiel and his brothers arose and built the altar of the God of Israel to
offer burnt offerings on it, as it is written in the law of Moses, the man of
God. So they set up the altar on its foundation, for they were terrified
because of the peoples of the lands; and they offered burnt offerings on it to
the LORD, burnt offerings morning and evening.&quot;  (Ezra 3:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Positive volition in production is often first challenged
by the emotional nostalgia. Ezra 3:10-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now when the builders had laid the foundation of the
temple of the LORD, the priests stood in their apparel with trumpets, and the
Levites, the sons of Asaph, with cymbals, to praise the LORD according to the
directions of King David of Israel. They sang, praising and giving thanks to
the LORD, saying, &quot;For He is good, for His lovingkindness is upon Israel
forever.&quot; And all the people shouted with a great shout when they praised
the LORD because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid. Yet many of
the priests and Levites and heads of fathers' households, the old men who had
seen the first temple, wept with a loud voice when the foundation of this house
was laid before their eyes, while many shouted aloud for joy, so that the
people could not distinguish the sound of the shout of joy from the sound of
the weeping of the people, for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the
sound was heard far away.&quot;  (Ezra 3:10-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Positive volition in production will always be met with
opposition. It comes in a number of ways. The first attempt to oppose true
positive volition is a false positive volition coming in from the outside. Ezra
4:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now when the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the
people of the exile were building a temple to the LORD God of Israel, they
approached Zerubbabel and the heads of fathers' households, and said to them,
&quot;Let us build with you, for we, like you, seek your God; and we have been
sacrificing to Him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assyria, who brought us
up here.&quot;&quot;  (Ezra 4:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The second attempt to oppose positive volition in
production was the “weakening” of their hands by the people of the land and the
troubling of them. Ezra 4:4-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then the people of the land discouraged the people of
Judah, and frightened them from building, and hired counselors against them to
frustrate their counsel all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the
reign of Darius king of Persia.&quot;  (Ezra 4:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ezra 4:4-5, “discouraged” is the intensive piel
participle of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>רפה</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (râphâh) and means to dishearten or to
discourage. “Frightened” is the intensive piel participle of <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>בּלהּ</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> (bâlah) meaning to dismay or terrify. This is the intimidation
route to cause great fear. “Frustrate” is in the hiphil stem of <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>פָּרַר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> (parar) and means to cause to be ineffective in their purpose.
This was done by hired counsellors. The idea of putting a person under legal
pressure, putting a lawyer on a case against you, tying you up in red tape,
thus detracting from your purposes.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The third attempt was slander and false accusations by
mail. The letter is written under the guise of a concern for the king. The
welfare of the person receiving the mail is always appealed to. This is false
interest. The enemies of Israel were not interested in the slightest in the
welfare of King Artaxerxes, only getting a punch in on Israel. Ezra 4:11-16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;this is the copy of the letter which they sent to him:
&quot;To King Artaxerxes: Your servants, the men in the region beyond the
River, and now let it be known to the king that the Jews who came up from you
have come to us at Jerusalem; they are rebuilding the rebellious and evil city
and are finishing the walls and repairing the foundations. &quot;Now let it be
known to the king, that if that city is rebuilt and the walls are finished,
they will not pay tribute, custom or toll, and it will damage the revenue of
the kings. &quot;Now because we are in the service of the palace, and it is not
fitting for us to see the king's dishonor, therefore we have sent and informed
the king, so that a search may be made in the record books of your fathers. And
you will discover in the record books and learn that that city is a rebellious
city and damaging to kings and provinces, and that they have incited revolt
within it in past days; therefore that city was laid waste. &quot;We inform the
king that if that city is rebuilt and the walls finished, as a result you will
have no possession in the province beyond the River.&quot;&quot;  (Ezra
4:11-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Positive volition in production at times may be
temporarily stopped by the opposition. God allows it but it must always resume
again. Ezra 4:23-24; Ezra 5:7-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then as soon as the copy of King Artaxerxes' document was
read before Rehum and Shimshai the scribe and their colleagues, they went in
haste to Jerusalem to the Jews and stopped them by force of arms. Then work on
the house of God in Jerusalem ceased, and it was stopped until the second year
of the reign of Darius king of Persia.&quot;  (Ezra 4:23-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Positive volition in production must continue until the
job in finished. Ezra 6:15-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;This temple was completed on the third day of the month
Adar; it was the sixth year of the reign of King Darius. And the sons of
Israel, the priests, the Levites and the rest of the exiles, celebrated the
dedication of this house of God with joy. They offered for the dedication of
this temple of God 100 bulls, 200 rams, 400 lambs, and as a sin offering for
all Israel 12 male goats, corresponding to the number of the tribes of Israel.
Then they appointed the priests to their divisions and the Levites in their
orders for the service of God in Jerusalem, as it is written in the book of
Moses.&quot;  (Ezra 6:15-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The completion of one act of positive volition in
production will open the way for greater expression of positive volition in the
worship of God. Ezra 6:19-22.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The exiles observed the Passover on the fourteenth of the
first month. For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together;
all of them were pure. Then they slaughtered the Passover lamb for all the
exiles, both for their brothers the priests and for themselves. The sons of
Israel who returned from exile and all those who had separated themselves from
the impurity of the nations of the land to join them, to seek the LORD God of
Israel, ate the Passover. And they observed the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven
days with joy, for the LORD had caused them to rejoice, and had turned the
heart of the king of Assyria toward them to encourage them in the work of the
house of God, the God of Israel.&quot;  (Ezra 6:19-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The expression of positive volition of the first group of
Jews was followed by positive volition in production of others. Ezra 7:1-10. 
Ezra was prepared. He had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord. He
had prepared his heart to do it. He had prepared his heart to teach it. Ezra
was authorized by the king. Ezra 7:11-26. Positive volition to doctrine results
in a positive volition to procedures of correction. Ezra 9:1 through Ezra
10:19.</p>
