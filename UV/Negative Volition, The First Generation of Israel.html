<h2>Negative Volition, The First Generation of Israel</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first generation of the nation of Israel began with
the Exodus from Egypt in 1441 BC. This first generation exhibited long-term negative
volition to God who freed them from the slavery of Egypt. They rebelled against
God’s instruction given through the leadership of Moses. They continued their
negative volition even with the visible presence of God as the Shekinah Glory
in the cloud by day and pillar of fire by night. They remained negative even
with the daily supernatural provision of manna and water. Exodus 13:21; Exodus
16:4; Exodus 17:6. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/S/The%20Shekinah%20Glory.html">The
Shekinah Glory</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD was going before them in a pillar of cloud by day to
lead them on the way, and in a pillar of fire by night to give them light, that
they might travel by day and by night.” (Exodus 13:21, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD said to Moses, &quot;Behold, I will rain bread
from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a day's portion
every day, that I may test them, whether or not they will walk in My
instruction.” (Exodus 16:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock at
Horeb; and you shall strike the rock, and water will come out of it, that the
people may drink.&quot; And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.”
(Exodus 17:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God provides His grace to believers as they grow
spiritually. They may even receive something that they didn’t work for. Deut.
6:10-11. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Then it shall come about when the LORD your God
brings you into the land which He swore to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac and
Jacob, to give you, great and splendid cities which you did not build, and
houses full of all good things which you did not fill, and hewn cisterns which
you did not dig, vineyards and olive trees which you did not plant, and you eat
and are satisfied,&quot;  (Deuteronomy 6:10-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We may have a tendency to forget who provides our
prosperity. All that we have is from Him. We need to remember that every day.
We must live our lives as unto the Lord. Deut. 6:12-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;then watch yourself, that you do not forget the LORD who
brought you from the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. &quot;You
shall fear only the LORD your God; and you shall worship Him and swear by His
name.&quot;  (Deuteronomy 6:12-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Deuteronomy 6:13, “fear only the Lord” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>יָרֵא</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(yare) and means to reverence, to respect,
to recognize the absolute authority of. “Worship Him” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>עבד</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(‛âbad) and means to work, to produce, it is what the
Lord thinks. You take the Lord’s thoughts (Bible doctrine) more seriously than
what you think. “Swear” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שׁבע</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(shâba‛) and means
to complete, literally to “seven oneself,” to repeat a declaration seven times.
That is absolute obedience to the dictates of Scripture. This is the believer’s
way of learning Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Deuteronomy 6:14, “You shall not follow other gods” is
a command. You must keep yourself to the Lord alone. You must separate from
religion and from neighboring heathen. Today, this means to stay away from
believers who do not attend Bible class and are negative to Bible doctrine. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;You shall not follow other gods, any of the gods of
the peoples who surround you, for the LORD your God in the midst of you is a
jealous God; otherwise the anger of the LORD your God will be kindled against
you, and He will wipe you off the face of the earth.&quot;  (Deuteronomy
6:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Deuteronomy 6:15, “for the Lord your God in the midst
of you is a jealous God” is an anthropopathism and means God is very possessive
of those who are His, just as a father is possessive and protective of his
children. An anthropopathism is language of accommodation or figures of speech
that assign human emotions or attitudes to God that He does not possess so as
to convey God's infinite attributes and policies to finite mankind. God’s
justice administers divine discipline in love for us to turn us back to Bible
doctrine. He intensifies the divine discipline the longer we stay negative. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If we stay negative to Him and His thinking (Bible
doctrine) long enough, He may administer the Sin Unto Death which means the
negative believer’s purpose on earth is done and God takes the reversionistic
believer home to be with Him. There is never loss of salvation to those who
have accepted Jesus Christ as their Savior, regardless of their behavior
following faith belief. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You must never tempt or test God as the Jews did at
Massah. In Deuteronomy 6:16, “test” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>נסה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (nâsâh)
and means to put to the test, to attempt. In Numbers 14:1-2, the Kadesh-Barnea
incident, they believed the ten fearful Jewish leaders sent into the Land to
spy, but not the two positive confident leaders who recommended entering the
Land and allowing the Lord to deliver it to them as He promised. The Jews were
tempting or testing the Lord. They received severe divine discipline for this.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;You shall not put the LORD your God to the test, as
you tested Him at Massah.&quot;  (Deuteronomy 6:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Numbers 14:1-2, when they cried, it was indicative of
a mental attitude of spiritual immaturity or being negative to God's promises.
“Grumbling” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>לוּן</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(lun) and means to
stop, to stay (in a bad sense), to be stubborn, to complain, to bitch. They grumbled
against Moses and Aaron, their leaders. These were sins of the tongue.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then all the congregation lifted up their voices and
cried, and the people wept that night. All the sons of Israel grumbled against
Moses and Aaron; and the whole congregation said to them, &quot;Would that we
had died in the land of Egypt! Or would that we had died in this
wilderness!&quot;  (Numbers 14:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Deuteronomy 1:27, “you grumbled in your tents” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>רגן</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(râgan) and means to rebel, to murmur, to
grumble. Their grumbling became a group situation that grew from two or three
families gathered together and finally a nation.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and you grumbled in your tents and said, 'Because the
LORD hates us, He has brought us out of the land of Egypt to deliver us into
the hand of the Amorites to destroy us.&quot;  (Deuteronomy 1:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The overt activity at Meribah became a controversy with
quarreling and striving to involve large numbers of people. Num. 20:13; Num.
20:24; Num. 27:14; Deut. 33:8; Psalms 81:7; Heb. 3:7ff. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Those were the waters of Meribah, because the sons of
Israel contended with the LORD, and He proved Himself holy among them.&quot; 
(Numbers 20:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Aaron will be gathered to his people; for he shall
not enter the land which I have given to the sons of Israel, because you
rebelled against My command at the waters of Meribah.&quot;  (Numbers 20:24,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;You called in trouble and I rescued you; I answered
you in the hiding place of thunder; I proved you at the waters of Meribah.
Selah.&quot;  (Psalms 81:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Numbers 14:4, the grumbling became a conspiracy, a
revolt, and an attempt to overthrow the leadership of Moses and Aaron. “A
leader” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>ראשׁ</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(rô'sh) and means a
general, a usurper, a puppet. They wanted to appoint a new leader who would
take them back to Egypt and leave Moses in the desert. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So they said to one another, &quot;Let us appoint a
leader and return to Egypt.&quot;&quot;  (Numbers 14:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Moses and Aaron called a public assembly. There were only
four men who stood - Moses, Aaron, Caleb and Joshua. Only four!! They saw the
issue clearly and spoke from divine viewpoint. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces in the presence
of all the assembly of the congregation of the sons of Israel. Joshua the son
of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, of those who had spied out the land,
tore their clothes;&quot;  (Numbers 14:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Numbers 14:10, “said to stone them with stones” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>אמר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>('âmar) and means to declare, to demand
that they should all stone them.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But all the congregation said to stone them with stones.
Then the glory of the LORD appeared in the tent of meeting to all the sons of
Israel.&quot;  (Numbers 14:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Lord’s response following Moses’ plea to the Lord to
not destroy them was still a severe penalty – none would enter the Land save
Joshua and Caleb.  Num. 14:29-30. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;your corpses will fall in this wilderness, even all your
numbered men, according to your complete number from twenty years old and
upward, who have grumbled against Me. 'Surely you shall not come into the land
in which I swore to settle you, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua
the son of Nun.&quot;  (Numbers 14:29-30, NASB)</p>
