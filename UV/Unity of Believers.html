<h2>Unity of Believers</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All believers are in union with Christ, was all have a
position in Christ called Positional Truth. There is no spiritual superiority
because of Positional Truth. Eph. 4:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“There is one body and one Spirit, just as also you were called
in one hope of your calling;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 4:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Holy Spirit, one Spirit, indwells all believers. Eph.
4:2-4; 1 Cor. 6:19-20; Gal. 3:2; John 7:37-39; John 14:16-17. </p>

<p class=Verses>“with all humility and gentleness, with patience, showing
tolerance for one another in love, being diligent to preserve the unity of the
Spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body and one Spirit, just as also you
were called in one hope of your calling;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 4:2-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy
Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and that you are not your own?
For you have been bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Corinthians 6:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“This is the only thing I want to find out from you: did you
receive the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by hearing with faith?”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Galatians
3:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood
and cried out, saying, “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink. “He
who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, ‘From his innermost being will flow
rivers of living water.’“ But this He spoke of the Spirit, whom those who
believed in Him were to receive; for the Spirit was not yet given, because
Jesus was not yet glorified.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 7:37-39, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Helper,
that He may be with you forever; that is the Spirit of truth, whom the world
cannot receive, because it does not see Him or know Him, but you know Him
because He abides with you and will be in you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 14:16-17,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is the indwelling of Jesus Christ. Eph. 3:17; Rev.
3:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; and
that you, being rooted and grounded in love,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 3:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“‘Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears My
voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and will dine with him, and he
with Me.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation 3:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every believer is their own priest and all are in full
time Christian service. Every believer is an ambassador - a representative of
Christ on earth. As such, every believer is a witness. All have the completed
Canon of Scripture. Everything God wants us to know is in writing. We all have
the same supernatural way of life available to us which requires a supernatural
execution. There is one hope - all believers have the same eternal future and a
resurrection body. Eph. 4:3; 1 Thess. 4:16-18; Phil. 3:20-21; 1 John 3:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout,
with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in
Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up
together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we shall
always be with the Lord. Therefore comfort one another with these words.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Thessalonians 4:16-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For our citizenship is in heaven, from which also we eagerly
wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ; who will transform the body of our
humble state into conformity with the body of His glory, by the exertion of the
power that He has even to subject all things to Himself.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Philippians
3:20-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“See how great a love the Father has bestowed on us, that we
would be called children of God; and such we are. For this reason the world
does not know us, because it did not know Him. Beloved, now we are children of
God, and it has not appeared as yet what we will be. We know that when He
appears, we will be like Him, because we will see Him just as He is.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
John 3:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One Lord - the same Savior and one faith. Eph. 4:3-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond
of peace. There is one body and one Spirit, just as also you were called in one
hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians
4:3-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One baptism - the Baptism of the Holy Spirit. John 17:22;
Eph. 4:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>““The glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that
they may be one, just as We are one;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 17:22, NASB)</p>
