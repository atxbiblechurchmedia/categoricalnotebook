<h2>The Unpardonable Sin</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The unpardonable sin is the decision of unbelief or rejection
of Jesus Christ as personal Savior. The unpardonable sin is not adultery,
suicide, using profanity, or any willful sin. Nor is it constant repetition of
any sin resulting in the Sin Unto Death. It is not calling your brother a fool,
falling away, etc. These are the most common erroneous concepts of the
unpardonable sin. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 12:31 and Mark 3:28-29, the unpardonable sin
of rejection of the work of Jesus Christ is called “blasphemy against the
Spirit.”</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Therefore I say to you, any sin and blasphemy shall be
forgiven people, but blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven.”
(Matthew 12:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Truly I say to you, all sins shall be forgiven the sons
of men, and whatever blasphemies they utter; but whoever blasphemes against the
Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin&quot;—”
(Mark 3:28-29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The unpardonable sin was not poured out on Christ on the
Cross and therefore was not judged. All sins are pardonable except rejection of
Jesus Christ as Savior. 1 Peter 2:24; 2 Cor. 5:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, so that
we might die to sin and live to righteousness; for by His wounds you were
healed.” (1 Peter 2:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that
we might become the righteousness of God in Him.” (2 Corinthians 5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The unpardonable sin is a decision made by an unbeliever.
It is impossible for the believer to commit the unpardonable sin. Isaiah 1:18;
Isaiah 44:22; 1 John 1:7; Psalms 103:12. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Come now, and let us reason together,&quot; Says the
LORD, &quot;Though your sins are as scarlet, They will be as white as snow;
Though they are red like crimson, They will be like wool.” (Isaiah 1:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I have wiped out your transgressions like a thick cloud
And your sins like a heavy mist. Return to Me, for I have redeemed you.&quot;”
(Isaiah 44:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“but if we walk in the Light as He Himself is in the Light, we
have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us
from all sin.” (1 John 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“As far as the east is from the west, So far has He removed our
transgressions from us.” (Psalms 103:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The unpardonable sin is not a single sin or act. It is
not progressive. It is not repetitious except in its expression. If you reject
the Gospel, when you hear it again you may continue to reject. It is
unpardonable. There is nothing in the plan of God which provides forgiveness
for it. Acts 4:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;And there is salvation in no one else; for there is no
other name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must be
saved.&quot;” (Acts 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When this act of unbelief is operational, it is always
condemned. John 3:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;He who believes in Him is not judged; he who does not
believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the
only begotten Son of God.” (John 3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The alternative to this unpardonable act is to believe in
Jesus Christ and be saved. However, if rejection persists to the point of
physical death, then the unbeliever’s eternal future is locked-in. See category
