<h2><a name="_Negative_Volition,_Human"></a><a name="_M._D-Negative_Volition,"></a>Negative
Volition, Human Good and Sin</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Negative volition is expressed first in the changing of
yourself from a thing that is positive to a thing that is negative. In
Galatians 1:6, “deserting” is the present middle indicative of <span lang=EL>μετατι</span>́<span
lang=EL>θημι</span> (metatithēmi) in the Greek and means to transpose,
transfer, to desert. It means that the people doing it will be affected by
their actions. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I am amazed that you are so quickly deserting Him who
called you by the grace of Christ, for a different gospel;&quot;  (Galatians
1:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You cannot participate in negative volition and not
expect to participate in its side effects. Negative volition is never satisfied
to dwell by itself. It always seeks to get others involved. This is usually
done by the agitation principle. In Galatians 1:7, “disturbing” is <span
lang=EL>ταρα</span>́<span lang=EL>σσω</span> (tarassō) and means to stir up,
doubt, to bring anxiety. This is a favorite trick of negative volition - just
to get you to question the teaching. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;which is really not another; only there are some who are
disturbing you and want to distort the gospel of Christ.&quot;  (Galatians 1:7,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Negative volition is expressed by an attempt to corrupt
the message of the communicator and cast suspicion on his person. This comes
from the term “distort” is <span lang=EL>μεταστρε</span>́<span lang=EL>φω</span>
(metastrephō) in the Greek and means to corrupt. Negative volition is not
satisfied to influence the ones who are receiving the message, but extends to
the corrupting of the message if possible and also that of the person and his
motivations.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Negative volition always has its own production which can
only be sin, human good and evil. In Galatians 1:13, the context of this manner
of life was that of excellent, superabundant production and much promotion. Of
course, this is human good operation all the way and of no account in the eyes
of God.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For you have heard of my former manner of life in
Judaism, how I used to persecute the church of God beyond measure and tried to
destroy it;&quot;  (Galatians 1:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The production of human good and the negative volition
function are seen to have many shades and sides. Satan is not without his
program of success as well as God. We find the following to be ingredients in
the human good expression of negative volition. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Religion</i>: The Jews’ religion, Judaism in the
Greek, refers to the religious system and the practices attached to the human
good system. This reveals the true character of human good as religious and
that religion is also a human good system. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Persecuted</i>: This is the principle of
“self-appointment” to straighten everyone else out. Those screaming “love
everyone” are the last to love anyone. Those yelling for “free speech” are the
first to heckle in a public meeting. Those yelling for “equal rights” are the
first to walk or sit on the rights of others. Negative volition in its human
good expression believes that it is doing God a favor by giving all others
their just persecution. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Overthrowing</i>: Negative volition is not satisfied
to differ with another’s position, nor to just influence others against it, nor
to just persecute those embracing it, but it finds it necessary to completely
overthrow it. The English term “wasted” means in the Greek to “overthrow.”
People in America today have been brainwashed into thinking that we can live
mutually inclusive of those who oppose us. This is not true. The human heart is
just as diabolical as it ever was. Negative volition in the life of a man has
not changed either. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Advancing</i>: This is the Greek meaning of the
English word “profited.” It is the concept of promotion and advancement. It is
a false conclusion to assume that there is not promotion, advancement,
position, status, etc. in the human good circles of religion. The ladder
climbing concept has always been in Christianity and much of the supposed
blessing of God today on local churches is no more than a repeat of the
advancing principle of Galatians 1:14. This gravy train has many passengers and
will lead directly to the same destination, the Judgment Seat of Christ, with a
full load of wood, hay and straw. Man in his human good will have enough fuel
to stoke the fires of hell for a 1,000 years. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my
contemporaries among my countrymen, being more extremely zealous for my
ancestral traditions.&quot;  (Galatians 1:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Zealous</i>: Negative volition is able to spark an
intensity of interest and motivation that often makes the categorical doctrinal
believer look like a very carnal Christian. People will tithe their incomes
while their families starve. They will go without the necessities of life as an
evidence of their spirituality. They will accept the taboos of others and
abandon their own Christian liberty under the motivation of Christian service.
There is no lack in religion and negative volition human good production for
the principle of dedication. Negative volition and human good production not
only have a certain character about them, they usually follows a definite
pattern of mechanical expression. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Utilization of the Reputation Principle</i>: This has
two ideas. First, there is the idea of using another’s reputation to gain
recognition for yourself. Secondly, there is the reliance on your own
reputation to acquire stature for your mischief. The Judaistic legalizers
sought first to identify with those of notable reputation in Jerusalem, then to
parade their own supposed reputation. This is reputation by association. Paul,
however, smelled them out. Gal. 2:2-7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;It was because of a revelation that I went up; and I
submitted to them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but I did so in
private to those who were of reputation, for fear that I might be running, or
had run, in vain. But not even Titus, who was with me, though he was a Greek,
was compelled to be circumcised. But it was because of the false brethren
secretly brought in, who had sneaked in to spy out our liberty which we have in
Christ Jesus, in order to bring us into bondage. But we did not yield in
subjection to them for even an hour, so that the truth of the gospel would
remain with you. But from those who were of high reputation (what they were
makes no difference to me; God shows no partiality)—well, those who were of
reputation contributed nothing to me. But on the contrary, seeing that I had
been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been to
the circumcised&quot;  (Galatians 2:2-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Infiltration</i>: This is seen by the terms “secretly
brought in, sneaked in, and spy out.” “Secretly brought in” means to be
secretly brought in by someone. “Spy out” indicates their purpose for coming.
Infiltration always implies disguise. They were patient in their disguise, but
it didn’t work. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Domination</i>: Negative volition in human good
production has the ultimate goal of total domination of the life of the person.
This is indicated by the term “bondage.” Negative volition, being the opposite
of positive volition, therefore, seeks to ensnare not to liberate.
Denominations and church organizations for decades have not sought to teach
people the truth which would liberate them, but rather they have sought to
control and legislate programs of actions and life to bring the person around
to their position. Negative volition and human good production is never
designed for the benefit of those subject to it, but rather to those initiating
it.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Separation</i>: For centuries the legalists have loved
and revered the doctrine of separation in the Scriptures. However, their
understanding of the true doctrine of separation is quite limited and grossly
misapplied. This aspect of human good is found in Galatians 2:12-13 with the
terms “withdrew” and “separated.” From this chapter alone, if nothing else was
in the Word, we could determine that not all separation from people and
practices is bona fide. The meaning of “withdraw” is to draw back. The meaning
of “separated” is to separate and limit. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Bible does
teach the principle of separation, but from believers who are disobeying the
content of doctrine and doctrinal issues. In Galatians, the issue was not one
of doctrine but one of Jewish tradition. This was a taboo carry-over. How often
today the issues of separation are not doctrinal issues but personal background
issues. Separation from someone who dances, smokes, goes to movies, swims with
the girls, wears short skirts, plays cards, drinks booze, etc. becomes the
issue and the real issues of doctrine are left in the lurch. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For prior to the coming of certain men from James, he
used to eat with the Gentiles; but when they came, he began to withdraw and
hold himself aloof, fearing the party of the circumcision. The rest of the Jews
joined him in hypocrisy, with the result that even Barnabas was carried away by
their hypocrisy.&quot;  (Galatians 2:12-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Dissimulation</i>: This is the “split-up” concept. The
natural, logical result of negative volition and human good is not unity but
division. Negative volition attacks the “assembling of the saints” for Bible
doctrine. Churches have split into ineffective groups because of choirs, dress,
programs, finances, personalities, and as a result have fragmented in unity and
stability. This is not to say that Satan does not have his unifying factors, but
true unity in fellowship of a local church is not a result of human good
production but rather content of doctrine being taught and the resulting
spiritual growth of the congregation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Many can be influenced to follow this hypocrisy, while
again, many will feign a compliance with it and use it as a means of personally
abandoning the ship. Since negative volition renders a believer out of
fellowship with God, it leaves man with only the ability to accept the
principle of approval as embraced by the world of mankind. This principle of
approval in the human realm is that of justification by works. Man is impressed
with what man can do. Therefore, the believer operating under negative volition
and in legalism applies the same principle to God that he applies to man. Paul
alludes to this concept in Galatians 1:10 where he says, “Am I trying to please
or impress man or God?” The legalist impresses man by his works, therefore, he
is deluded into thinking that God is no doubt impressed also. He is wrong and
stupid.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I
striving to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a
bond-servant of Christ.&quot;  (Galatians 1:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Negative volition has two ways to go in the life of a
believer. The two fold expression of negative volition will be that of human
good or that of sin. Now that Paul has hit the human good angle, he moves to
hit the sin angle. The very system that the negative volition believer takes
renders him a transgressor. Sin occurs in several ways in the text, the normal
being the concept to “miss the mark.” Here the transgressor term means one who
has violated the law of God, therefore, the thing is sin.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The issue of sin as an expression of negative volition
has been taken care of on the Cross by the work of Christ. Christ bore all
personal sins on the Cross and faith in Christ puts the believer into a
position no longer responsible to pay for them with some human system of good.
This is Galatians 2:20 with the relationship of the believer perpetuated by
faith through the Christian way of life.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no
longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the
flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for
me.&quot;  (Galatians 2:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Negative volition and its expressions of human good and
sin are said to “nullify” the grace of God in Galatians 2:21. The believer in
fellowship does not do this. The term “nullify” means to act toward anything as
though it were annulled ,or nullified, or to slight it. The believer in
negative volition and human good or sin is actually turning their back on the
grace of God. God honors the faith of the believer. Negative volition turns to
a works principle which man honors. This is loving the praise of man more than
the approval of God.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;I do not nullify the grace of God, for if
righteousness comes through the Law, then Christ died needlessly.&quot;&quot; 
(Galatians 2:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Negative volition and human good production know how to
appeal to the trends and facets of the old sin nature. It capitalizes on your
susceptibilities. One of the trends or lusts in the old sin nature is that of
approbation or the lust for praise or approval. This is found in the term
“bewitched” in Galatians 3:1 and in the Greek means to bring evil on one by
feigned praise, to charm, to bewitch. This is the old public relations gimmick
where someone tells you how great you are and that only you could do the job,
that you are such a testimony that you can’t really afford to not do that, etc.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;You foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, before
whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified?&quot;  (Galatians
3:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Negative volition and human good production will dull the
senses of the person in remembering the true basis for any relationship,
fellowship, or production before God. This is found in Galatians 3:2-3, with
Paul’s rhetorical questions. The seriousness of this is underlined in 2 Peter
1:8-9. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;This is the only thing I want to find out from you: did
you receive the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by hearing with faith? Are
you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the
flesh?&quot;  (Galatians 3:2-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they
render you neither useless nor unfruitful in the true knowledge of our Lord
Jesus Christ. For he who lacks these qualities is blind or short-sighted,
having forgotten his purification from his former sins.&quot;  (2 Peter 1:8-9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The negative volition, human good, and sin issue raises
the question of the two sources of power in the life of the believer. The two
sources are the Holy Spirit and the flesh or old sin nature. This identifies
the two sources for production, the true source being the Holy Spirit and the
source of human good and sin being the “flesh.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Scripture in Galatians 3:22 makes it clear that a
person who expresses negative volition and enters human good production does
not stay with that but moves eventually into the realm of actual sin. Human
good production is worthless in God’s sight as far as production is concerned.
If it is done out of fellowship, it is human good and worthless. The point of
Galatians 3:22 is that man moves from human good to sin with all being shown to
be in sin.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But the Scripture has shut up everyone under sin, so that
the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who
believe.&quot;  (Galatians 3:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Negative volition and human good legalism does not begin
as curtailment of overt specified sins in the Scripture. For a believer to
refrain from designated sins is only common sense and they are a fool not to.
These may be mental attitude sins, sins of the tongue, or overt sins. The term
“element” in Galatians 4:3 refers to the fundamental principles of an art or
discipline. These are legitimate principles of life. The legalism enters the
picture when the believer takes normal life practices of common sense or
discipline and makes the practice of these things either salvation or the
spiritual way of life. Honesty is a principle of life, but it is not
spirituality. Decency is a principle of life but it is not spirituality.
Morality is a principle of life but it is not spirituality. Tranquility is a
principle of life but it is not spirituality. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So also we, while we were children, were held in bondage
under the elemental things of the world.&quot;  (Galatians 4:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Success is a principle of life but is not maturity.
Reputation is a principle of life but is not maturity. Endurance is a principle
of life, but is not maturity. Discipline and sacrifice are principles of life,
but they are not indications of some great arrival of spirituality. Col.
2:18-23.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Let no one keep defrauding you of your prize by
delighting in self-abasement and the worship of the angels, taking his stand on
visions he has seen, inflated without cause by his fleshly mind, and not
holding fast to the head, from whom the entire body, being supplied and held
together by the joints and ligaments, grows with a growth which is from God. If
you have died with Christ to the elementary principles of the world, why, as if
you were living in the world, do you submit yourself to decrees, such as,
&quot;Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch!&quot; (which all refer to
things destined to perish with use)—in accordance with the commandments and
teachings of men? These are matters which have, to be sure, the appearance of
wisdom in self-made religion and self-abasement and severe treatment of the
body, but are of no value against fleshly indulgence.&quot;  (Colossians
2:18-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer in negative volition and human good
production does not learn by experience. Gal. 3:3. They classify their failures
as tests. They call their pressures persecution. Their ignorance they call
simplicity. Their legalism they call dedication. Their tenacity they call
endurance. Their programs they call production. Their reticence they call
objectivity. Their personality they call spirituality. Their carnality they
call personality. Their taboos they call doctrines. Their tastes they call
principles. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you
now being perfected by the flesh?&quot;  (Galatians 3:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Galatians 3:4, the first class condition in the Greek
indicates that the person has suffered all these things truly in vain. The
first class condition is “if” and it is true. The believer in negative volition
and human good production based on a works system is shot down from the very
beginning. The very system that they seek to embrace will rise up and curse them.
When the Law or some legalistic system is adhered to, the problem lies in the
inability to perform in entirety. Within the human good system there will be
parts that are completely beyond the person’s ability to perform. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Did you suffer so many things in vain—if indeed it was in
vain?&quot;  (Galatians 3:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The legalist in human good production must keep everyone
approving them. They must keep their children in line, their dress in line, their
money in line, their possessions in line, etc. Somewhere along the path, some
feature will be glaringly deficient and then the friendly system will rise up
and smite them. Gal. 3:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For as many as are of the works of the Law are under a
curse; for it is written, &quot;CURSED IS EVERYONE WHO DOES NOT ABIDE BY ALL
THINGS WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE LAW, TO PERFORM THEM.&quot;&quot;  (Galatians
3:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Human good can never replace God's grace system. No
matter how much we desire to alleviate the human suffering, the human need,
correct the human injustices, the only proper way to approach it is through the
grace system. Gal. 3:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;What I am saying is this: the Law, which came four
hundred and thirty years later, does not invalidate a covenant previously
ratified by God, so as to nullify the promise.&quot;  (Galatians 3:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Now, we come to the real issue of negative volition, the
human good system. It is the counterfeiting of a true system. The Law in
Galatians was given for specific purposes. The Judaistic legalists took the Law
from its original purposes and gave it other functions. The Galatian believers
were doing the same thing. The human good system is actually a counterfeit
system of spiritual production. All counterfeit systems base themselves on a
former mold or impression. Therefore, they often have to use the same language,
the same structure, propagate the same overt objectives, etc. Human good
expresses itself in prayer, giving, church attendance, writing, preaching,
witnessing, evangelizing, just like the bona fide production of the grace
system of spiritual gifts under the filling of the Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Galatians 4:8, we have the slavery concept which has
been removed at the initial faith in Jesus Christ at the point of salvation. In
Galatians 4:9, we have the term “turn back” which means to return, turn back,
or come back. Human good production of a believer is actually a return to
pre-salvation means of production. The believer in negative volition who
perpetuates their production reverts back to their manner of life before
salvation.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;However at that time, when you did not know God, you were
slaves to those which by nature are no gods. But now that you have come to know
God, or rather to be known by God, how is it that you turn back again to the
weak and worthless elemental things, to which you desire to be enslaved all
over again?&quot;  (Galatians 4:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Not only is there a return to the pre-salvation human
good system, there is also a decided drive to do it. The term “desire” in
Galatians 4:9 means to be resolved, determined and hold a purpose. Negative
volition does not remain passive, but takes an active role in the human good
production. It is not just an omission, but rather an object and purpose to be
pursued. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Galatians 4:10 we have the English term “observe.”
This term in Greek means to keep scrupulously, to neglect nothing requisite to
this religious observance. In other words, nothing is too dear to sacrifice to
be able to maintain their overt observance of their program. They will give up
their favorite television show, bowling, even friends in their fanaticism for
human good production. Overt observances center on the idea of “special
things.” We are living in a day when ministers capitalize on this same concept.
They have a Labor Day message, Thanksgiving message, Christmas message, New
Year’s Day message, and one for Lincoln’s birthday, Washington’s birthday, the
4th of July, Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, Veteran’s Day, Flag Day, Safety Week,
Ecology Week, Conservation Week. The list is never ending.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;You observe days and months and seasons and years.&quot; 
(Galatians 4:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Galatians 4:17-18, we get an inside look into the
human good expression of negative volition. This is found in several terms,
“eagerly seek” and “shut you out.” This term “eagerly seek” in the Greek means
to “seek to draw over to one’s side.” One of the keynote objections of the
human good system of negative volition to sound doctrine is to subtly draw you
over to their way of thinking. This would be comparable to legalistic believers
who infiltrate otherwise sound Bible teaching categorical churches and attempt
to draw various people over to their way of thinking concerning programs, and
other gimmick systems of the local church which they wish to promote.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;They eagerly seek you, not commendably, but they wish to
shut you out so that you will seek them. But it is good always to be eagerly
sought in a commendable manner, and not only when I am present with you.&quot; 
(Galatians 4:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When Paul picks an illustration of legalism, negative
volition in religion, he uses the Old Testament concept of Hagar and Sarah. He
refers to Hagar as a bondwoman and Sarah as a free woman. He is making an
analogy to the nature of human good production as compared to that of the
divine good spiritual production. The production of those two women in each
case was a child, one boy each. God recognized the production of Sarah because
it depended upon grace and rejected the production of Hagar because it depended
on human ingenuity. This is developed in Galatians 4 extensively.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Law is seen as a bondage system if looked at as a way
of salvation. The term ‘slavery” in Galatians 5:1 refers to the grievous
burdens the Law puts on its adherents. Human good is a slavery system because
it does not free mankind, but rather it puts on them grievous burdens too heavy
to bear. Churches saddle pastors with all kinds of human good responsibilities
in the ministry. They include such things as attending funerals, doing house to
house visitation, entertaining in the parsonage because it belongs to the
church as property, frequenting social functions in the community to show the
church’s interest in the community life, calling at hospitals at the birth of
babies and so-called tragedies, giving well wishes at graduations,
participating in local clubs, groups, serving on a multitude of committees,
taking leadership in fund raising for charity, etc. These are some of the
grievous burdens that churches bind on pastors which cuts them almost totally
out of their ministry of study and teaching the Word and shepherding of their
flock. If the shepherd doesn’t know how to tend his own sheep, since when do
the sheep outline his care procedures?</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;It was for freedom that Christ set us free; therefore
keep standing firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery.&quot; 
(Galatians 5:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Galatians 5:1-6 we have two more terms pertinent to
the understanding of human good production. This is the term “yoke” and the
term “circumcision.” The term “yoke” means troublesome laws or bureaucratic red
tape. The human good system seeks to control and curtail positive volition to
Bible doctrine by getting things tied up in the legal or administrative
procedures. Denominations for decades have tied the hands of pastors who very
well understood the function of their ministry, but the structure of their
constitution or association or fellowship or denomination hierarchy has
suppressed them with controls. This is the yoke of troublesome laws. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;It was for freedom that Christ set us free; therefore
keep standing firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery. Behold I,
Paul, say to you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will be of no benefit
to you. And I testify again to every man who receives circumcision, that he is
under obligation to keep the whole Law. You have been severed from Christ, you
who are seeking to be justified by law; you have fallen from grace. For we
through the Spirit, by faith, are waiting for the hope of righteousness. For in
Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything, but faith
working through love.&quot;  (Galatians 5:1-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The second term “circumcision” deals with the ritual
concept. What the legalist is not able to tie up with administrative controls
and policies, they tie up with ritual necessities. Circumcision was a ritual
which had a bona fide meaning used in the context of its proper function. When
this ritual was taken from this function, then it became a tool in the hands of
the legalist to manipulate other believers. Baptism and communion are rituals
also and for centuries churches have controlled whole assemblies and held them
virtually in limbo by their singular adherence to that church’s concept of
water baptism or communion. Many Baptist churches have held their entire bodies
together on the principle of baptism and this is true of others also. Others
relate communion to the elite of the church membership, etc. This is the
misusing of the ritual concept.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Not only does human good attempt to frustrate grace
principles with red tape and ritual, it seeks to cut off the opportunity to
proceed. This is found in the term “hindered” in Galatians 5:7. This word in
the Greek means a cutting made in a road to hinder an enemy in pursuit, to
create a diversion to delay them. These are gimmicks in the human good system
that are designed to divert attention, to delay, to detour the attack of sound
doctrine from overtaking their devices. This diversion from them is accomplished
by persuading you against the truth.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;You were running well; who hindered you from obeying the
truth?&quot;  (Galatians 5:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This diversion technique in the Greek is called a
“deceptive and treacherous persuasion.” In the English it is the term
“persuasion” and is found in Galatians 5:8. One of the features of sound
doctrine is that it is active and is on a search and destroy mission for all
false doctrine. The book of Galatians in itself is a demonstration of this
principle. Titus 1 sets forth the aggressive role of sound doctrine that is
designed to stop the mouths of those gainsayers who do not hold the truth. This
diversion is designed by the devil to divert the believer on to another course
so his pursuit will lead to someone other than the legalist.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;This persuasion did not come from Him who calls
you.&quot;  (Galatians 5:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Galatians 5:9 we encounter the term “leaven.” This
feature of legalism emphasizes the powerful subversive effect of “just a little
goes a long way.” The term “leaven” in the Greek means mental and moral
corruption, the tendency to infect others, influence thoroughly pervading a
thing, a pernicious influence, a single sin corrupting a whole church, a few
false teachers leading a church into error. Isagogically, “leaven” was used in
the making of bread. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;A little leaven leavens the whole lump of dough. &quot; 
(Galatians 5:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some of the factors concerning leaven are: It took time
to fulfill its function. It occurred unseen over a period of time. You could
see the effects of it, but not the process. It rendered the bread better to the
taste as the unleavened bread was said to be insipid in taste.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Galatians 5:10, we have the term “disturbing you”
which is a participle in the Greek and thus presents the characteristic of the
legalist. He is a natural troublemaker. In the Greek, the term means to render
one anxious or distressed by suggesting scruples of doubt. This is the same as
in Galatians 1:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I have confidence in you in the Lord that you will adopt
no other view; but the one who is disturbing you will bear his judgment,
whoever he is.&quot;  (Galatians 5:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;which is really not another; only there are some who are
disturbing you and want to distort the gospel of Christ.&quot;  (Galatians 1:7,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Galatians 5:13, we find another term pertinent to an
understanding of human good and legalism. This is the term “opportunity” and
means a base of operations, a launching pad from which to pursue their attack.
This is the concept of finding one facet that violates the legalistic system
then using it as a base to find greater things to differ with. Paul talks about
this in Galatians 2 where he unveils the spy concept in Jerusalem designed to
spy out his liberty. Hoping to catch Paul, in this feature, they hoped to use
it to discredit his ministry. A legalist only needs one thing upon which to set
up shop and from which he can direct a more full and varied attack. This is the
military tactic of establishing a beachhead. In Galatians 5:13, the grace
oriented believer is not to use their liberty, on the other hand, to do the
same thing. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For you were called to freedom, brethren; only do not
turn your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one
another.&quot;  (Galatians 5:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>So Galatians 2 is a reference to the Jerusalem incident.
In 2 Corinthians 12:12, he uses it of misdirected believers in the Corinthian
church who would have pounced on the money sent to Paul. Again, Paul beat them
to the punch and didn’t make finances an issue.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The signs of a true apostle were performed among you with
all perseverance, by signs and wonders and miracles.&quot;  (2 Corinthians
12:12, NASB)</p>
