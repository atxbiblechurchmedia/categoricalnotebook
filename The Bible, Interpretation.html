<h2>The Bible, Interpretation</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What you believe the Bible teaches in prophecy depends
upon how you approach interpretation of the Bible. The main premises of the
pre-Tribulational Rapture position are the literal interpretation of the
Scriptures, the dispensational interpretation of the Word of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Literal interpretation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To interpret literally is nothing more or less than
interpreting words and sentences in their normal, usual, customary, and proper
designation. Land of Canaan means real land, dirt, earth.  Forever used of the
land of Canaan means “forever” not just a long time. The basic issue is whether
the biblical documents are to be approached in the normal, customary, usual way
in which men talk, write, and think; or whether that level is only preliminary
to second deeper levels.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The allegorist says that the “land of Canaan” has to
become heaven, to believe any other thing is to be woodenheaded. If this was
carried forth in our own history, the famous ride of Paul Revere would be as
conscience riding to the rescue of virtue at the approach of temptation. Adam
and Eve lose their historical significance and only exist to illustrate a
point.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Literal interpretation does not rule out the use of
figurative speech, parables, types and so on. The principle is that behind the
figurative use of a word, there is always a literal meaning that God intended.
In Genesis 15:1, “I am a shield to you” means God is Abram’s protector. “Your
reward shall be very great” means that God will bless him greatly. In John
10:9, “I am the door” does not mean that Christ is a literal door, but that He
is the only opening or means to reaching heaven.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in
a vision, saying, &quot;Do not fear, Abram, I am a shield to you; Your reward
shall be very great.&quot;&quot;  (Genesis 15:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he will
be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture.&quot;  (John 10:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Cultural Interpretation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A most important principle is that the Bible must be
interpreted in accordance with the time in which it was written. The
interpreter must study Bible history and history of nations surrounding the
Bible. The interpreter must study Bible geography. The interpreter must study
Bible culture.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For example, Grecian lamps in use in Palestine were very
small and for the foolish virgins to expect them to burn for the three-hour
vigil (or longer) was very foolish. The interpreter should study the political
structure of Bible times, the philosophy of the Pharisees, Sadducees,
Herodians, etc. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The interpreter should study the legal system and its
systems of penalty. For example, the aspects of the trials of Christ including illegal
movements in them by the Sanhedrin. The interpreter should understand the
religious practices of Judaism. For example, if a girl fell and got mud on her
skirt on the Sabbath, she would not be allowed to change the dress or wash it
off. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The interpreter should understand the economic structure
of Bible times. The interpreter should understand the Roman Empire had a
tremendous economy and why. They should understand Julius Caesar and the use of
slavery in Roman times. Cultural interpretation is very important, but should
not become a fetish. It is not the dominating factor in interpretation!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Critical Interpretation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Critical interpretation does not mean skepticism. Critical
interpretation means that any interpretation of Scripture must have adequate
justification. The interpreter must understand clearly why such interpretation
was made and it must make sense according to the existing facts!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Interpretation must not conflict with the facts of
history. Interpretation must not conflict with the four-fold navigational fix
of the original languages. Interpretation must not conflict with the cultural
use of a word. Interpretation must not conflict with the facts of geography at
the time of writing. The truest interpretations are those with the best
justification.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Use of Greek Text in Interpretation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Greek language is so explicit that it can be subject
to only one interpretation. Syntax deals with the grammatical relationships
between words. Every Greek verb has a four-fold navigational fix. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Tense (kind of action):</u> </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Tense is an expression of the action or time of the verb.
The <i>present tense</i> is habitual action in present time - “our lamps are
going out” in Matthew 25:8. The <i>imperfect tense</i> is continuous action in
past time - “And the crowds were questioning him” in Luke 3:10. The <i>perfect tense</i>
is the completed tense as in Ephesians 2:8-9. The <i>aorist tense</i> is the occurring
tense - “forty-six years to build this temple” in John 2:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;The foolish said to the prudent, 'Give us some of
your oil, for our lamps are going out.'&quot;  (Matthew 25:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And the crowds were questioning him, saying, &quot;Then
what shall we do?&quot;&quot;  (Luke 3:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that
not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no
one may boast.&quot;  (Ephesians 2:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The Jews then said, &quot;It took forty-six years to
build this temple, and will You raise it up in three days?&quot;&quot;  (John
2:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Voice:</u> </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The voice is the relationship of the subject to the main
verb. In the <i>active voice</i>, the subject produces the action of the verb.
In Acts 16:31, “Believe” is active, you must believe, you must initiate the
action of believing. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;They said, &quot;Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will
be saved, you and your household.&quot;&quot;  (Acts 16:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the <i>passive voice</i>, the subject receives the
action of the main verb. The voice of grace in “by grace you have been saved” in
Ephesians 2:8. In the <i>middle voice</i>, the subject is benefitted by the
action of the verb. In John 15:16, “You did not choose Me but I chose you”
means “I have chosen you for my benefit.”</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that
not of yourselves, it is the gift of God;&quot;  (Ephesians 2:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;You did not choose Me but I chose you, and
appointed you that you would go and bear fruit, and that your fruit would
remain, so that whatever you ask of the Father in My name He may give to
you.&quot;  (John 15:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Mood:</u> </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mood is the speaker’s or writer’s attitude toward
reality. The <i>imperative mood</i> is the mood of command. In 1 Corinthians
11:24, “do this in remembrance of Me” means “keep on doing this in remembrance
of Me.” In Matthew 5:44 “love your enemies” means “keep on loving your enemies.”
 </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said,
&quot;This is My body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of
Me.&quot;&quot;  (1 Corinthians 11:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for
those who persecute you,&quot;  (Matthew 5:44, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The <i>indicative mood</i> is the mood of reality and
means the event actually occurred as indicated. For example, in John 1:1 “In
the beginning was the Word.” The <i>subjunctive mood</i> is the potential mood,
it could happen potentially. In John 14:31, “let us go from here” is an
example. The <i>optative mood</i> expresses a wish. In 2 Thessalonians 3:5 “May
the Lord direct your hearts” is an example.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,
and the Word was God.&quot;  (John 1:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;but so that the world may know that I love the Father, I
do exactly as the Father commanded Me. Get up, let us go from here.&quot; 
(John 14:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;May the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and
into the steadfastness of Christ.&quot;  (2 Thessalonians 3:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Etymology: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Etymology is how a word was used at the time in which it
was written. It is used to bring out the true meaning of a word. What Ephesians
4:14 is really saying is; “If you don’t know Bible doctrine as a Christian,
it’s like shooting craps with the devil, and the devil has loaded the dice so
the odds are against you.”</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here
and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery
of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming;&quot;  (Ephesians 4:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Vocabulary in Interpretation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 2:19, Adam needed vocabulary to accomplish a
task, i.e. name the animals. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the
field and every bird of the sky, and brought them to the man to see what he
would call them; and whatever the man called a living creature, that was its
name.&quot;  (Genesis 2:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 2:23, Adam named his wife “Woman.” </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The man said, &quot;This is now bone of my bones, And
flesh of my flesh; She shall be called Woman, Because she was taken out of
Man.&quot;&quot;  (Genesis 2:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 3:20, Adam renamed his wife “Eve.” To teach,
one needs vocabulary, a factual vocabulary which is based upon categories. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now the man called his wife's name Eve, because she was
the mother of all the living.&quot;  (Genesis 3:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s essence has ten main characteristics. God is light.
The barrier between Man and God has six problems to be solved: sin, penalty of
sin, physical birth, the character of God, human good of man, and life. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Man is immoral, self-righteous, religious or a
combination of all three. The Cross is the meeting place of God and man. Grace
is what God does for man, man receives it, God is glorified.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Salvation is obtained only by believing in Christ.
Faith-believe is a transitive verb where the object of merit is Jesus Christ. To
be justified means to be made righteous. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Use of Techniques in Interpretation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Techniques are used in interpretation. The technique of confession
of sin using 1 John 1:9. Claiming God's promises, faith-rest. Living in the
Word by studying it, surveying it, categorizing it, and meditating on it. The
Holy Spirit controlling the believer’s soul through the filling of the Holy
Spirit. Thinking divine viewpoint versus human viewpoint.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&quot;  (1 John
1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The compartments of the soul: self-consciousness,
mentality, volition, emotion, conscience. You are either positive to Bible
doctrine and applying the <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in your soul to
life’s situations while being in fellowship with the Lord or you are negative
to Bible doctrine and in a state of carnality with the old sin nature
controlling your soul and building scar tissue. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A believer is either 100% in fellowship with the Holy
Spirit controlling the soul or 100% out of fellowship in a state of sin with
the old sin nature controlling the soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Positional Truth and our relationship with Jesus Christ.  Eternal
life, absolute righteousness, predestination, election, priesthood, kingship,
sanctification, accepted in the beloved, heirship, sonship, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Why so Many Scriptural Interpretations?</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Why are there so many different Scriptural interpretations?
Some teachers of the Word of God are born-again, some are not!  Some teachers
of the Word of God believe in verbal inspiration of the Scriptures, some do
not. Some teachers of the Word of God do not have access to the original
language, some do. This affects interpretation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some teachers of the Word of God consistently prepare
(study), some do not. Some teachers of the Word of God function according to
isagogics, categories, exegesis and the Greek’s four-fold grammatical
navigational fix. Some teachers of the Word of God are men pleasers and some
are God pleasers. This affects interpretation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The principle here is the interpreter of Scripture must be
consistently accurate, a pastor-teacher  must be saved and operate constantly
on positive volition, according to the Bible.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Positive Volition is Vital for Proper Bible
interpretation.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The application of 1 John 1:9 puts the carnal believer
back in fellowship with God. You must be in fellowship to understand the stages
of spiritual growth and the occupational hazards of each. 1 John 1:1-10; 1 John
2:12-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“What was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have
seen with our eyes, what we have looked at and touched with our hands,
concerning the Word of Life— and the life was manifested, and we have seen and
testify and proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was
manifested to us— what we have seen and heard we proclaim to you also, so that
you too may have fellowship with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the
Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ. These things we write, so that our joy
may be made complete. This is the message we have heard from Him and announce
to you, that God is Light, and in Him there is no darkness at all. If we say
that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do
not practice the truth; but if we walk in the Light as He Himself is in the
Light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son
cleanses us from all sin. If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving
ourselves and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, He is faithful
and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all
unrighteousness. If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar and His
word is not in us.” (1 John 1:1-10, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“I am writing to you, little children, because your sins have
been forgiven you for His name’s sake. I am writing to you, fathers, because
you know Him who has been from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men,
because you have overcome the evil one. I have written to you, children,
because you know the Father. I have written to you, fathers, because you know
Him who has been from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because
you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the
evil one.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 John 2:12-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You must develop spiritual discernment. You must learn
the Word of God when it is available. Life is too short to waste it. Find your
priorities and stick with them. 1 Cor. 2:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT
HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Until you have found a good local church that teaches
Bible doctrine, get recorded Bible doctrine lessons from reputable
pastor-teachers who teach Bible doctrine from the original languages and begin learning
the Word of God. Listen to these recorded lessons when you are traveling or
have time during the day. But the most effective way is to get face-to-face
categorical teaching with an open Bible before you, you can study as the Word
is taught.</p>
