anyone's father or mother.&quot;  (Jeremiah 16:7, NASB)</p>

to Your servant.” (Psalms 119:76, NASB)</p>

dir=RTL>שׁוּב</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (shûb) and

messenger to those who send him, For he refreshes the soul of his masters.”
(Proverbs 25:13, NASB)</p>

lang=AR-SA dir=RTL>רוח</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span>
(râvach) and means to revive, to get relief, to be refreshed. Saul was
refreshed with the playing of the harp by David. The functioning of a believer
in fellowship is refreshing to other believers even if there is no rapport
between them.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So it came about whenever the evil spirit from God came to
Saul, David would take the harp and play it with his hand; and Saul would be
refreshed and be well, and the evil spirit would depart from him.” (1 Samuel
16:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Greek Words For Encouragement</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EL>Θα</span>́<span lang=EL>ρσος</span>

believers coming to meet him. Acts 28:15.</p>

far as the Market of Appius and Three Inns to meet us; and when Paul saw them,

lang=EL> </span>(paramuthion) used for a persuasive address, a comfort of love.

any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EL>Θαρσε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(tharseō) is used to be of good courage (only in the imperative mood). The

courage; your faith has made you well.&quot; At once the woman was made well.”

refreshment of soul when operating under heavy responsibilities, whether that

will give you rest.” (Matthew 11:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 7:13, Titus was refreshed by the
response of the Corinthian believers. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason we have been comforted. And besides our
comfort, we rejoiced even much more for the joy of Titus, because his spirit
has been refreshed by you all.” (2 Corinthians 7:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Philemon 1:20, Paul was refreshed in soul by

refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains;” (2 Timothy 1:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EL>Τυγχα</span>́<span lang=EL>νω</span><span
lang=EL> </span><span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>πιμε</span>́<span lang=EL>λεια</span>
(tugchanō epimeleia) is used to obtain care. In Acts 27:3, Paul refreshed
himself among his friends. He needed patching up.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The next day we put in at Sidon; and Julius treated Paul with
consideration and allowed him to go to his friends and receive care.” (Acts
27:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EL>Συναναπαυ</span>́<span lang=EL>ομαι</span>
(sunanapauomai) is used to refresh one’s spirit with one, to give and get
refreshment in Romans 15:32.</p>

<p class=Verses>“so that I may come to you in joy by the will of God and find
refreshing rest in your company.” (Romans 15:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EL>Παρα</span>́<span lang=EL>κλησις</span>
(paraklēsis) is used for appeal and entreaty in<u> </u>2 Corinthians 8:4 and 2
Corinthians 8:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;begging us with much urging for the favor of
participation in the support of the saints,&quot;  (2 Corinthians 8:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For he not only accepted our appeal, but being himself
very earnest, he has gone to you of his own accord.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 8:17,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'><span lang=EL>Παρα</span>́<span
lang=EL>κλησις</span> (paraklēsis) is used for exhortation and encouragement. Acts
15:31; Rom. 12:8; 1 Cor. 14:3; Phil 2:1; 1 Thess. 2:3; 1 Tim. 4:13; Heb. 12:5;
Acts 13:15; Heb. 13:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When they had read it, they rejoiced because of its
encouragement.&quot;  (Acts 15:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;or he who exhorts, in his exhortation; he who gives, with
liberality; he who leads, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with
cheerfulness.&quot;  (Romans 12:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But one who prophesies speaks to men for edification and
exhortation and consolation.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 14:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if
there is any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if
any affection and compassion,&quot;  (Philippians 2:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For our exhortation does not come from error or impurity
or by way of deceit;&quot;  (1 Thessalonians 2:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But I urge you, brethren, bear with this word of
exhortation, for I have written to you briefly.&quot;  (Hebrews 13:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EL>Παρα</span>́<span lang=EL>κλησις</span>
(paraklēsis) is used for consolation and comfort.<u> </u>Luke 6:24; Acts 9:31;
2 Cor. 1:4-7; 2 Cor. 7:4; 2 Cor. 7:7; 2 Cor. 7:13; 2 Thess. 2:16; Philemon 1:7.
</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;But woe to you who are rich, for you are receiving
your comfort in full. &quot;  (Luke 6:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and
Samaria enjoyed peace, being built up; and going on in the fear of the Lord and
in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it continued to increase.&quot;  (Acts 9:31,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Great is my confidence in you; great is my boasting on
your behalf. I am filled with comfort; I am overflowing with joy in all our
affliction.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 7:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and not only by his coming, but also by the comfort with
which he was comforted in you, as he reported to us your longing, your
mourning, your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced even more.&quot;  (2 Corinthians
7:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself and God our Father,
who has loved us and given us eternal comfort and good hope by grace,&quot;  (2
Thessalonians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For I have come to have much joy and comfort in your
love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you,
brother.&quot;  (Philemon 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EL>Παρα</span>́<span lang=EL>κλητος</span>
(paraklētos) is used for advocacy.<u> </u><i>Parakletos</i> means to be called
to one’s aid in a judicial cause as a lawyer, an advocate, pleader,
intercessor. It is used in Rabbinic literature as “a friend of the accused
person, called to speak to his character or otherwise enlist sympathy in his
favor.” It is used of Christ in 1 John 2:1 as our advocate or defense attorney.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;My little children, I am writing these things to you so
that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father,
Jesus Christ the righteous;&quot;  (1 John 2:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Parakletos</i> is used of the Holy Spirit in John
14:16, John 14:26, John 15:26, and John 16:7 as our “Helper.”</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another
Helper, that He may be with you forever;&quot;  (John 14:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father
will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your
remembrance all that I said to you.&quot;  (John 14:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;When the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from
the Father, that is the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, He will
testify about Me,&quot;  (John 15:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;But I tell you the truth, it is to your advantage
that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but
if I go, I will send Him to you.&quot;  (John 16:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EL>Παρακαλε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(parakaleō) is used to call, to summon, to invoke, to beseech, to implore, to
entreat.<u> </u>This is not a command. It doesn’t have the authority of the
evangelist or pastor-teacher. Acts 28:20; Matt. 26:53; 2 Cor. 12:8; Philemon
1:9; Matt. 8:5; Mark 1:40; Acts 16:9; Mark 5:17; Luke 8:41; Acts 8:31; Mark
14:36; Mark 5:18; Luke 8:31.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;For this reason, therefore, I requested to see you
and to speak with you, for I am wearing this chain for the sake of the hope of
Israel.&quot;&quot;  (Acts 28:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And a leper came to Jesus, beseeching Him and falling on
his knees before Him, and saying, &quot;If You are willing, You can make me
clean.&quot;&quot;  (Mark 1:40, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;They were imploring Him not to command them to go away
into the abyss.&quot;  (Luke 8:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EL>Παρακαλε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(parakaleō) is used to urge, to admonish, to exhort. Luke 3:18; Rom. 12:8; 2
