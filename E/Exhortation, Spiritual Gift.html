<h2><a name="_Exhortation,_Spiritual_Gift"></a>Exhortation, Spiritual Gift</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The spiritual gift of exhortation is the permanent gift
of counseling, comforting, warning, and advising. This spiritual gift is one of
the most difficult to describe and define. The broad spectrum of function of
the gift of exhortation is revealed in the participle of the Greek verb
παρακαλέω (parakaleō) and means to exhort, to encourage, to comfort. So,
which is it? This verb is found in Romans 12:8. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;or he who exhorts, in his exhortation; he who gives, with
liberality; he who leads, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with
cheerfulness.&quot;  (Romans 12:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Does a believer with this gift exhort? Does he encourage?
Does he comfort? Yes. All of these. However, all believers are expected to
function in each of these areas as they encounter other believers in their
spiritual life. In contrast, believers with gift of exhortation, manifest the
Holy Spirit through an extraordinary grace enablement as they come alongside a
fellow believer as only the Paraclete, the Holy Spirit could. John 14:16; John
14:26; John 15:26; John 16:7. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another
Helper, that He may be with you forever;” (John 14:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will
send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance
all that I said to you.” (John 14:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;When the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the
Father, that is the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, He will
testify about Me,” (John 15:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But I tell you the truth, it is to your advantage that I
go away; for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but if I go,
I will send Him to you.” (John 16:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This gift may also be exercised through prayer
ministries, music ministries, visitation ministries, etc. As a speaking gift,
such believers compliment other speaking gifts in wonderful ways, and are
valuable in the administrative function of the local church. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The spiritual gift of exhortation can aid pastor-teachers
in the local church by freeing them of troubleshooting details. This is the
“wise man” of 1 Corinthians 6:4-6. </p>

<p class=Verses>“So if you have law courts dealing with matters of this life,
do you appoint them as judges who are of no account in the church? I say this
to your shame. Is it so, that there is not among you one wise man who will be
able to decide between his brethren, but brother goes to law with brother, and
that before unbelievers?” (1 Corinthians 6:4-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The gift of exhortation enables a believer to encourage
another believer or to warn another believer. The gift is exercised in the
local church and in one on one situations. Phil. 4:2-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I urge Euodia and I urge Syntyche to live in harmony in
the Lord. Indeed, true companion, I ask you also to help these women who have
shared my struggle in the cause of the gospel, together with Clement also and
the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.&quot; 
(Philippians 4:2-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 12:8, the Greek word for “exhortation” is <span
lang=EL>παρα</span>́<span lang=EL>κλησις</span> (paraklēsis) and means exhortation,
admonition, encouragement, consolation, comfort, solace, that which affords
comfort or refreshment. Although mutual exhortation or encouragement has always
been the responsibility of all believers, this spiritual gift provides a far
greater ability to advise and exhort others from Bible doctrine in their souls.
Rom. 1:12; 1 Thess. 5:14. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;that is, that I may be encouraged together with you while
among you, each of us by the other's faith, both yours and mine.&quot;  (Romans
1:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;We urge you, brethren, admonish the unruly, encourage the
fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with everyone.&quot;  (1 Thessalonians
5:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The gift of exhortation is a protective gift, a unifying
gift, a gift of optimism. The gift does not carry the authority of the
evangelist or pastor-teacher, but is absolutely necessary for the growth and
function of the Body of Christ. </p>
