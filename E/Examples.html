<h2><a name="_Examples"></a>Examples</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are five Greek terms that are used to convey the
concept of example in the New Testament. The Greek terms in context have the
concepts of warning, imitation, benefit, prevention, admonition, clarification,
communication, and demonstration. The Greek terms for “example” are given
regarding good works, unbelief, disgrace, pastoral ministry, testing, guidance,
and discernment. The Bible contains many uses of examples given that are not
specifically accompanied by Greek words of example.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Jude 1:7, the Greek word <span lang=EL>δει</span>͂<span
lang=EL>γμα</span><span lang=EL> </span>(deigma) refers to a specimen of a
thing set forth as a warning. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them,
since they in the same way as these indulged in gross immorality and went after
strange flesh, are exhibited as an example in undergoing the punishment of
eternal fire.&quot;  (Jude 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 8:5 and Hebrews 9:23, the Greek word <span
lang=EL>υ</span>̔<span lang=EL>πο</span>́<span lang=EL>δειγμα</span><span
lang=EL> </span>(hupodeigma) is used as a figure or copy of a thing. In John
13:15 and James 5:10, it is used for certain examples to be imitated. In Hebrews
4:11 and 2 Peter 2:6, certain examples are designed as warnings. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, just
as Moses was warned by God when he was about to erect the tabernacle; for,
&quot;SEE,&quot; He says, &quot;THAT YOU MAKE all things ACCORDING TO THE
PATTERN WHICH WAS SHOWN YOU ON THE MOUNTAIN.&quot;&quot;  (Hebrews 8:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore it was necessary for the copies of the things
in the heavens to be cleansed with these, but the heavenly things themselves
with better sacrifices than these.&quot;  (Hebrews 9:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;For I gave you an example that you also should do
as I did to you. &quot;  (John 13:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;As an example, brethren, of suffering and patience, take
the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.&quot;  (James 5:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore let us be diligent to enter that rest, so that
no one will fall, through following the same example of disobedience.&quot; 
(Hebrews 4:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and if He condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to
destruction by reducing them to ashes, having made them an example to those who
would live ungodly lives thereafter;&quot;  (2 Peter 2:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 7:44, the Greek word τύπος (tupos) refers to an
example as a pattern in conformity to which a thing must be made. In 1 Corinthians
10:6 and 1 Corinthians 10:11, it refers to an example as a pattern of warning.
In Philippians 3:17 and 1 Timothy 4:12, certain examples are to be imitated. In
Titus 2:7, a person is to show himself an example of good works. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Our fathers had the tabernacle of testimony in the
wilderness, just as He who spoke to Moses directed him to make it according to
the pattern which he had seen.&quot;  (Acts 7:44, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now these things happened as examples for us, so that we
would not crave evil things as they also craved.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 10:6,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now these things happened to them as an example, and they
were written for our instruction, upon whom the ends of the ages have
come.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 10:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Brethren, join in following my example, and observe those
who walk according to the pattern you have in us.&quot;  (Philippians 3:17,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Let no one look down on your youthfulness, but rather in
speech, conduct, love, faith and purity, show yourself an example of those who
believe.&quot;  (1 Timothy 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;in all things show yourself to be an example of good
deeds, with purity in doctrine, dignified,&quot;  (Titus 2:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 1:19, the Greek word is δειγματίζω
(deigmatizō) and means certain people are made an example to expose one to
disgrace. In Colossians 2:15, it is used where certain people or things are
shown to be examples of certain principles for the benefit of others. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And Joseph her husband, being a righteous man and not
wanting to disgrace her, planned to send her away secretly.&quot;  (Matthew
1:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When He had disarmed the rulers and authorities, He made
a public display of them, having triumphed over them through Him.&quot; 
(Colossians 2:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 6:47 and Luke 12:5, the Greek word ὑποδείκνυμι
(hupodeiknumi) is used where examples are used to teach by the use of a figure.
In Acts 20:35, the use of one’s self as an example is proper in teaching. In
Acts 9:16, an example is used to show a thing or make it more clearly known. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;Everyone who comes to Me and hears My words and
acts on them, I will show you whom he is like: &quot;  (Luke 6:47, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;But I will warn you whom to fear: fear the One
who, after He has killed, has authority to cast into hell; yes, I tell you,
fear Him! &quot;  (Luke 12:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;In everything I showed you that by working hard in
this manner you must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus,
that He Himself said, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'
&quot;&quot;  (Acts 20:35, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; for I will show him how much he must suffer for My
name's sake.&quot; &quot;  (Acts 9:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Uses of Examples</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s judgments on cities were used as examples of the
reality of the principle of divine discipline on believers and as examples of
the certainty of judgment on unbelievers. Jude 1:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them,
since they in the same way as these indulged in gross immorality and went after
strange flesh, are exhibited as an example in undergoing the punishment of
eternal fire.&quot;  (Jude 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The priests of the Old Testament system were examples of
the higher priesthood of Christ. Heb. 8:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, just
as Moses was warned by God when he was about to erect the tabernacle; for,
&quot;SEE,&quot; He says, &quot;THAT YOU MAKE all things ACCORDING TO THE
PATTERN WHICH WAS SHOWN YOU ON THE MOUNTAIN.&quot;&quot;  (Hebrews 8:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus refers to His actions of washing of the disciples’
feet as an example to the disciples of the balance between the authority and
grace aspect of the communicator’s ministry. John 13:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;For I gave you an example that you also should do
as I did to you. &quot;  (John 13:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The prophets were used in James as examples of suffering
affliction or the doctrines of undeserved suffering. James 5:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;As an example, brethren, of suffering and patience, take
the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.&quot;  (James 5:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Israelites in the wilderness were given as examples
of unbelief. Heb. 4:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore let us be diligent to enter that rest, so that
no one will fall, through following the same example of disobedience.&quot; 
(Hebrews 4:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The tabernacle was a product of the example God had shown
Moses in the Mount. Acts 7:44.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Our fathers had the tabernacle of testimony in the
wilderness, just as He who spoke to Moses directed him to make it according to
the pattern which he had seen.&quot;  (Acts 7:44, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Occurrences of history and experiences of people are
preserved in the Word of God as examples of prevention for believers in the
Church Age. 1 Cor. 10:6; 1 Cor. 10:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now these things happened as examples for us, so that we
would not crave evil things as they also craved.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 10:6,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now these things happened to them as an example, and they
were written for our instruction, upon whom the ends of the ages have
come.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 10:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers are admonished to use their spiritual leaders
as examples in discerning error in the walk of others from whom they may
receive improper influences. Phil. 3:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Brethren, join in following my example, and observe those
who walk according to the pattern you have in us.&quot;  (Philippians 3:17,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor or communicator, is admonished to be an
example of a believer in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in
faith, and in purity. 1 Tim. 4:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Let no one look down on your youthfulness, but rather in
speech, conduct, love, faith and purity, show yourself an example of those who
believe.&quot;  (1 Timothy 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“An example” is <span lang=EL>τυ</span>́<span lang=EL>πος</span><span
lang=EL> </span>(tupos) and is a pattern to be imitated. “Show yourself” is the
present middle imperative of <span lang=EL>γι</span>́<span lang=EL>νομαι</span><span
lang=EL> </span>(ginomai) and means to become, to keep on becoming. The intensive
middle applies to you, yourself. The imperative means it is not an option, but
a command. “In speech” <span lang=EL>εν</span><span lang=EL> </span><span
lang=EL>λο</span>́<span lang=EL>γος</span><span lang=EL> </span>(en logos) and
is the designation for speech. This does not refer to the written Word or the
content of Scripture, but the speech of the person.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“In conduct” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>ναστροφη</span>́
(anastrophē) and is the overt behavior pattern of life. “In love” is <span
lang=EL>εν</span><span lang=EL> </span><span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>γα</span>́<span
lang=EL>πη</span> (en agapē) and is a mental attitude. “In faith” is <span
lang=EL>εν</span><span lang=EL> </span><span lang=EL>πιστει</span><span
lang=EL> </span>(en pistei) and is the act or action of believing. This is the
faith referring to content, but faith as the process of receiving the Word of
God and using it. “In purity” is <span lang=EL>εν</span><span lang=EL> </span><span
lang=EL>α</span>̔<span lang=EL>γνει</span>́<span lang=EL>α</span> (en hagneia) and
refers to the sinlessness of life, the area therefore, being that of
fellowship, or practically the issue of staying in fellowship. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is no such animal as a sinless believer even among
pastors. But the emphasis here is that the pastor be an example of one who
stays in fellowship as a pattern of life and another could follow him.
Therefore, areas of pastoral example are: speech, behavior pattern, mental
attitude, act of believing, and staying in fellowship.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Young men are exhorted to be examples of good works in
doctrine and sound speech. God used the sin unto death on Ananias and Sapphira
as an example to the early church of the dire consequences of contrived and
long-term patterns of disobedience. Titus 2:7-8; Acts 5:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;in all things show yourself to be an example of good
deeds, with purity in doctrine, dignified, sound in speech which is beyond
reproach, so that the opponent will be put to shame, having nothing bad to say
about us.&quot;  (Titus 2:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And great fear came over the whole church, and over all
who heard of these things.&quot;  (Acts 5:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>James used the example of the patience of Job to
illustrate that greater blessing is for the believer after testing than he had
before. James used the example of Elijah as an illustration that a man’s status
is not what brings him the answers to prayer, but rather God does answer the
prayers of a single man. James 5:11, James 5:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;We count those blessed who endured. You have heard of the
endurance of Job and have seen the outcome of the Lord's dealings, that the
Lord is full of compassion and is merciful.&quot;  (James 5:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed
earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain on the earth for three
years and six months.&quot;  (James 5:17, NASB)</p>
