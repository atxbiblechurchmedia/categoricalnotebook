<h2><a name="_Essence_of_God_1"></a>Essence of God</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has ten attributes or characteristics that make up
His essence. They are; Sovereignty, Righteousness, Justice, Love, Eternal Life,
Omniscience, Omnipotence, Omnipresence, Immutability And Veracity. All of God's
attributes are perfect, infinite and unchanging. All that God does in
simultaneously compatible with all of His attributes. God has never done nor
ever will do anything that compromises any of His attributes.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>One in Essence</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When the Bible speaks of God being one, it is always
referring to essence, never to persons. The diagram below illustrates the
essence of God with respect to the Trinity whereby each Person of the Godhead
is coequal and co-eternal. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><img width=410 height=390
src="Essence%20of%20God1.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Light as an Illustration of God's Attributes</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To understand God's characteristics, attributes or
essence, that is, what He is like, we can look at the composition of light as
an illustration. John 8:12; 1 John 1:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then Jesus again spoke to them, saying, &quot;I am the
Light of the world; he who follows Me will not walk in the darkness, but will
have the Light of life.&quot; &quot;  (John 8:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;This is the message we have heard from Him and announce
to you, that God is Light, and in Him there is no darkness at all.&quot;  (1
John 1:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One ray of light as it comes to us from the sun actually
contains seven colors of light or a spectrum of light frequencies. These
frequencies can be grouped into visible colors that include red, yellow, blue,
orange, green, purple and indigo. Every time you see a ray of light coming from
the sun, that ray of light is one but inside that ray of light are all of the
above mentioned colors. When a ray of light hits an object, some of that light
is absorbed and some is reflected. When it is all reflected, you have white,
when it is all absorbed you have black. Thus, depending on the degree of
absorption or reflection, you see different combinations of these reflected
basic colors. In other words, a color is manifest such as red although every
other color is also there as well, you just don’t see it.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This phenomena is similar to how we “see” God. Just as
light has various colors or characteristics, so God has various characteristics
or attributes. We call these characteristics His essence. A ray of light has
many frequencies with some visible and colors and others not visible. God has
ten attributes or characteristics; Sovereignty, Righteousness, Justice, Love,
Eternal Life, Omniscience, Omnipotence, Omnipresence, Immutability, and
Veracity. The light ray box shown in the diagram below contains the basic
characteristics of light. God's essence box contains God's basic
characteristics. Now let’s look at these characteristics in detail.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><img width=330 height=360 id="Picture 1"
src="Essence%20of%20God2.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Sovereignty</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is absolute Sovereignty. God has will and has the
ability to make decisions. Any passage which deals with the will of God refers
to His sovereignty. There are certain times when God’s will is manifest and
there are certain times when His will is not manifest. But it is always there. Eph.
1:5; Col. 1:11; John 1:13; Psalms 115:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus
Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will,&quot; 
(Ephesians 1:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;strengthened with all power, according to His glorious
might, for the attaining of all steadfastness and patience; joyously&quot; 
(Colossians 1:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh
nor of the will of man, but of God.&quot;  (John 1:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But our God is in the heavens; He does whatever He
pleases.&quot;  (Psalms 115:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is the only eternal, infinite, self-determining
supreme being of the universe, therefore, the highest king. God always existed.
Dan. 4:35; Deut. 4:39; 1 Chron. 29:12; Job 9:12; Psalms 47:2; Psalms 83:18;
Psalms 93:1; Psalms 135:6; Acts 17:24; 2 Chron. 20:6; Heb. 6:13; Psalms 47:7. </p>

<p class=Verses>““All the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing,
But He does according to His will in the host of heaven And among the
inhabitants of earth; And no one can ward off His hand Or say to Him, ‘What
have You done?’“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Daniel 4:35, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““Know therefore today, and take it to your heart, that the
LORD, He is God in heaven above and on the earth below; there is no other.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Deuteronomy
4:39, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““Both riches and honor come from You, and You rule over all,
and in Your hand is power and might; and it lies in Your hand to make great and
to strengthen everyone.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Chronicles 29:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““Were He to snatch away, who could restrain Him? Who could say
to Him, ‘What are You doing?’“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Job 9:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the LORD Most High is to be feared, A great King over all
the earth.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 47:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“That they may know that You alone, whose name is the LORD, Are
the Most High over all the earth.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 83:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD reigns, He is clothed with majesty; The LORD has
clothed and girded Himself with strength; Indeed, the world is firmly
established, it will not be moved.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 93:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Whatever the LORD pleases, He does, In heaven and in earth, in
the seas and in all deeps.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 135:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““The God who made the world and all things in it, since He is
Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts
17:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and he said, “O LORD, the God of our fathers, are You not God
in the heavens? And are You not ruler over all the kingdoms of the nations?
Power and might are in Your hand so that no one can stand against You.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2
Chronicles 20:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For when God made the promise to Abraham, since He could swear
by no one greater, He swore by Himself,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 6:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For God is the King of all the earth; Sing praises with a
skillful psalm.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 47:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has absolute will and does whatever He pleases. He
makes decisions, policies and sets up principles. This is divine volition. In
His sovereignty, He was pleased to give man free will. The meeting place
between man and God is the Cross. Psalms 115:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But our God is in the heavens; He does whatever He pleases.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms
115:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><img width=510 height=200 id="Picture 182925656"
src="Essence%20of%20God3.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s sovereign plan for the human race is based on grace
and includes three phases. The first phase is salvation through faith alone in
Jesus Christ alone. The second phase is time on earth as a believer. The goal
is to be filled with the Holy Spirit the maximum amount of time, witness to
unbelievers, and grow in the spiritual life, thus glorifying God and fulfilling
His plan for our lives. The third phase is eternity in heaven with God. Acts
16:31; Eph. 5:18; 1 John 1:9; Acts 1:8; John 3:36.  See category on <a
href="#_D-God’s_Sovereignty">God’s Sovereignty</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“They said, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved,
you and your household.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 16:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but
be filled with the Spirit,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
John 1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon
you; and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and
Samaria, and even to the remotest part of the earth.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 1:8,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who does
not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(John
3:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Righteousness</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is absolute righteousness (+R). He is absolute
perfection. It is impossible for Him to do anything other than perfectly. This
means that His righteousness is never subject to change. It is always
absolutely perfect. It is not a relative righteousness like man has. Ezra 9:15;
Psalms 48:10; Psalms 119:137; Psalms 145:17; Jer. 23:6; 1 John 2:29.</p>

<p class=Verses>““O LORD God of Israel, You are righteous, for we have been
left an escaped remnant, as it is this day; behold, we are before You in our
guilt, for no one can stand before You because of this.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ezra
9:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“As is Your name, O God, So is Your praise to the ends of the
earth; Your right hand is full of righteousness.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 48:10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Tsadhe. Righteous are You, O LORD, And upright are Your
judgments.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 119:137, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD is righteous in all His ways And kind in all His
deeds.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 145:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““In His days Judah will be saved, And Israel will dwell
securely; And this is His name by which He will be called, ‘The LORD our
righteousness.’“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jeremiah 23:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“If you know that He is righteous, you know that everyone also
who practices righteousness is born of Him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 John 2:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Man is relative righteousness (-R). Isaiah 64:6; Rom.
3:10-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For all of us have become like one who is unclean, And all our
righteous deeds are like a filthy garment; And all of us wither like a leaf,
And our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah 64:6,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“as it is written, “THERE IS NONE RIGHTEOUS, NOT EVEN ONE;
THERE IS NONE WHO UNDERSTANDS, THERE IS NONE WHO SEEKS FOR GOD; ALL HAVE TURNED
ASIDE, TOGETHER THEY HAVE BECOME USELESS; THERE IS NONE WHO DOES GOOD, THERE IS
NOT EVEN ONE.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 3:10-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s absolute righteousness (+R) cannot have fellowship
with sinful man with only relative righteousness (-R). Isaiah 59:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But your iniquities have made a separation between you and
your God, And your sins have hidden His face from you so that He does not hear.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah
59:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God demands the same absolute righteousness (+R) in His
creatures that He has. We have to have this exact same perfect absolute
righteousness (+R) to get to heaven. One does not get it by working for it, but
by believing in the Lord Jesus Christ. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s absolute righteousness (+R) was satisfied with
Christ’s work on the Cross. Therefore, the meeting place is the Cross where
absolute righteousness (+R) is imputed to man by God at the point of salvation.
Rom. 3:22-23; 2 Cor. 5:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ
for all those who believe; for there is no distinction; for all have sinned and
fall short of the glory of God,” (Romans 3:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that
we might become the righteousness of God in Him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Corinthians
5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><img border=0 width=530 height=200 id="Picture 502332848"
src="Essence%20of%20God4.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You must understand that when God is working, perhaps His
attribute of absolute righteousness (+R) is not in evidence to you or appears
to be in the situation, but it is always there in every working of God. God is
always fair, honest and good! Why? Because He is perfect absolute
righteousness! See category on <a href="#_D-God’s_Righteousness">God's
Righteousness</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Justice</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is absolute perfect justice, therefore in every way
He deals with the human race He is absolutely just, He is right, He is perfect,
and He is fair. It is impossible for Him to do anything unfair. Because He is
righteousness, He takes issue with man’s sin, and because He is justice, He
pronounces the penalty upon man’s sin. God’s characteristics of sovereignty,
absolute righteousness, and justice all might not be manifest at the same time,
but they are there nonetheless. Deut. 32:4; Isaiah 45:21; 2 Chron. 19:7; Psalms
89:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>““The Rock! His work is perfect, For all His ways are just; A
God of faithfulness and without injustice, Righteous and upright is He.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Deuteronomy
32:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““Declare and set forth your case; Indeed, let them consult
together. Who has announced this from of old? Who has long since declared it?
Is it not I, the LORD? And there is no other God besides Me, A righteous God
and a Savior; There is none except Me.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah 45:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““Now then let the fear of the LORD be upon you; be very
careful what you do, for the LORD our God will have no part in unrighteousness
or partiality or the taking of a bribe.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Chronicles 19:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne;
Lovingkindness and truth go before You.” (Psalms 89:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is the perfect judge that placed a penalty on sin.
Heb. 12:23; Psalms 50:6; Rom. 6:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“to the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are
enrolled in heaven, and to God, the Judge of all, and to the spirits of the
righteous made perfect,” (Hebrews 12:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the heavens declare His righteousness, For God Himself is
judge. Selah.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 50:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is
eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 6:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s justice was satisfied because of His provision
through Jesus Christ who paid the penalty for all sin by His substitutionary
spiritual death on the Cross for all of mankind. Therefore, God is just to
condemn and just to forgive. Col. 2:14; Rom. 8:1; John 3:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“having canceled out the certificate of debt consisting of
decrees against us, which was hostile to us; and He has taken it out of the
way, having nailed it to the cross.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Colossians 2:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in
Christ Jesus.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 8:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““He who believes in Him is not judged; he who does not believe
has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only
begotten Son of God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>His justice demands that disobedience against His perfect
laws be punished. However, God’s grace always precedes judgment. John 3:36. See
category on <a href="#_D-God’s_Justice">God's Justice</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>““For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten
Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John
3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who does
not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(John
3:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Love</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is perfect and absolute love. God has always had a
perfect relaxed mental attitude. John 3:16; 1 John 4:7-8; Eph 2:4; 1 John 3:1;
1 John 4:9; 1 John 4:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>““For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten
Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John
3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God; and
everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. The one who does not love does
not know God, for God is love.” (1 John 4:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with
which He loved us,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 2:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“See how great a love the Father has bestowed on us, that we
would be called children of God; and such we are. For this reason the world
does not know us, because it did not know Him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 John 3:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“By this the love of God was manifested in us, that God has
sent His only begotten Son into the world so that we might live through Him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
John 4:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“We have come to know and have believed the love which God has
for us. God is love, and the one who abides in love abides in God, and God
abides in him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 John 4:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God in His Sovereignty decided to treat man in grace. His
perfect Love is the motivator of that grace. Eph. 2:8-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not
of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one
may boast.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 2:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s perfect righteousness (+R) and justice resulted in
a barrier between God and man because of man’s sin. God’s perfect righteousness
(+R) cannot have fellowship with sinful man. The best works that man can
achieve are only relative or imperfect righteousness (-R) and cannot ever
measure up the perfect righteousness (+R) of God. Isaiah 59:2; Isaiah 64:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But your iniquities have made a separation between you and
your God, And your sins have hidden His face from you so that He does not hear.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah
59:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For all of us have become like one who is unclean, And all our
righteous deeds are like a filthy garment; And all of us wither like a leaf,
And our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah 64:6,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Justice demanded a penalty for sin. In His perfect love,
God the Father sent His Son to the Cross to die spiritually for the sins of the
whole world. Rom. 6:23; John 3:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is
eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 6:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten
Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John
3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>So God's perfect righteousness and justice were satisfied
and love and eternal life can then be imputed by grace to man upon acceptance
of the saving work of Jesus Christ. The barrier has been removed. The only
issue now is man’s acceptance or rejection of the atoning work of the Lord
Jesus Christ on the Cross. The alternative to God’s love is His wrath
(righteousness and justice). If you do not accept Christ who satisfied the
righteousness and justice of God, then you are subject to His righteousness and
justice (wrath). John 3:36.</p>

<p class=Verses>““He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who does
not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(John
3:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some people ask, “Since God is a God of love, how could
He cast anyone into the lake of fire?” This is very simple to answer when you
consider that God is more than just love. He is also justice and righteousness
and under various circumstances various attributes are manifested, but not one
of them ever contradicts the other. See category on <a href="#_God's_Love">God's
Love</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Eternal Life</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is eternal life. He has always existed. He did not
have a beginning and will not have an end. There never has been a time when He
did not exist and there never will be a time in the future when He will not
exist. His life has no beginning and no ending. Exodus 15:18; Deut. 32:40;
Deut. 33:27; Job 36:26; Psalms 9:7; Psalms 135:13; Psalms 145:13; 1 Tim. 1:17,
Rev. 1:8, Isaiah 43:13; Psalms 90:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>““The LORD shall reign forever and ever.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Exodus
15:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“‘Indeed, I lift up My hand to heaven, And say, as I live
forever,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Deuteronomy 32:40, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““The eternal God is a dwelling place, And underneath are the
everlasting arms; And He drove out the enemy from before you, And said, ‘Destroy!’“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Deuteronomy
33:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““Behold, God is exalted, and we do not know Him; The number of
His years is unsearchable.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Job 36:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the LORD abides forever; He has established His throne for
judgment,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 9:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Your name, O LORD, is everlasting, Your remembrance, O LORD,
throughout all generations.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 135:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, And Your dominion
endures throughout all generations.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 145:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be
honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Timothy 1:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God, “who is and
who was and who is to come, the Almighty.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation 1:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““Even from eternity I am He, And there is none who can deliver
out of My hand; I act and who can reverse it?”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah 43:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Before the mountains were born Or You gave birth to the earth
and the world, Even from everlasting to everlasting, You are God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms
90:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To share His eternal life with us, God the Son was
willing to leave heaven and take on the form of humanity and die spiritually
for the sins of the world. John 10:17-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>““For this reason the Father loves Me, because I lay down My
life so that I may take it again. “No one has taken it away from Me, but I lay
it down on My own initiative. I have authority to lay it down, and I have
authority to take it up again. This commandment I received from My Father.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(John
10:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>His deity could not do this alone without compromising
His essence. God had to take on the form of perfect humanity to do it. See
category on the <a href="#_D-Hypostatic_Union_of_1">Hypostatic Union of Jesus
Christ.</a> Therefore, He took on the form of true humanity to become the
perfect God-man in one person forever in order to die spiritually on our behalf
on the Cross. Heb. 12:2; Heb. 2:14-15. </p>

<p class=Verses>“fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith,
who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has
sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 12:2,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood, He
Himself likewise also partook of the same, that through death He might render
powerless him who had the power of death, that is, the devil, and might free
those who through fear of death were subject to slavery all their lives.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews
2:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God imputes His eternal life to believers at the point of
salvation. Conversely the unbeliever does not share God’s eternal life. John
10:27-28; 1 John 5:11-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>““My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me;
and I give eternal life to them, and they will never perish; and no one will
snatch them out of My hand.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 10:27-28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the testimony is this, that God has given us eternal life,
and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has the life; he who does not
have the Son of God does not have the life.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 John 5:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Eternal life is always hard for people to understand.
Technically, eternal life pertains to God alone. God has no beginning and no
ending. Everlasting life to a believer has a beginning, but no ending as set
forth in John 3:16. A conclusion here is that since God has always existed, He
always knows about everything - long, long before it ever happens. See category
on <a href="#_D-God’s_Eternal_Life">God's Eternal Life</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For God so loved the world, that He gave His only
begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal
life.” (John 3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Omniscience</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is omniscient. He knows all that is knowable. This
includes all that will be (Foreknowledge) and all that could be, but will not
be. There never was a time when He did not know everything that would ever
happen and everything and could happen, but did not. This is the thinking of
God. He knew when you would be born, that you would be in Bible class tonight,
what you are thinking right now, and He knew that billions and billions of
years ago. 1 John 3:20; Prov. 15:3; Job 26:6; Col. 2:3; Job 31:4; Acts 2:23;
Matt. 10:29-30; Psalms 147:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“in whatever our heart condemns us; for God is greater than our
heart and knows all things.” (1 John 3:20, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“The eyes of the LORD are in every place, Watching the evil and
the good.” (Proverbs 15:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Naked is Sheol before Him, And Abaddon has no covering.”
(Job 26:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Colossians
2:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““Does He not see my ways And number all my steps?”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Job
31:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“this Man, delivered over by the predetermined plan and
foreknowledge of God, you nailed to a cross by the hands of godless men and put
Him to death.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 2:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““Are not two sparrows sold for a cent? And yet not one of them
will fall to the ground apart from your Father. “But the very hairs of your
head are all numbered.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 10:29-30, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He counts the number of the stars; He gives names to all of
them.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 147:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Therefore, God knows what we are thinking at all times.
He knows who is born again and who is not. 2 Tim. 2:19; Heb. 4:13; Acts 15:8;
Matt. 6:8; Psalms 139:2; Psalms 33:13-15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Nevertheless, the firm foundation of God stands, having this
seal, “The Lord knows those who are His,” and, “Everyone who names the name of
the Lord is to abstain from wickedness.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Timothy 2:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things
are open and laid bare to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews
4:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““And God, who knows the heart, testified to them giving them
the Holy Spirit, just as He also did to us;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 15:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““So do not be like them; for your Father knows what you need
before you ask Him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 6:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“You know when I sit down and when I rise up; You understand my
thought from afar.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 139:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD looks from heaven; He sees all the sons of men; From
His dwelling place He looks out On all the inhabitants of the earth, He who
fashions the hearts of them all, He who understands all their works.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms
33:13-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God cannot ever use His omniscience to be unfair. He is
absolute fairness. Therefore, God in His omniscience, works all things (good
and bad) together for the good of those who belong to Him. Rom. 8:28.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And we know that God causes all things to work together for
good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
8:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual knowledge is only imparted to the believer
through God’s Word through the enabling power of the Holy Spirit. 1 Cor. 2:16;
Heb. 4:12; 1 Cor. 2:9-12; 2 Tim. 2:15. See category on <a

<p class=Verses>“For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT
HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any
two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of
both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the
heart.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“but just as it is written, “THINGS WHICH EYE HAS NOT SEEN AND
EAR HAS NOT HEARD, AND which HAVE NOT ENTERED THE HEART OF MAN, ALL THAT GOD
HAS PREPARED FOR THOSE WHO LOVE HIM.” For to us God revealed them through the
Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God. For who
among men knows the thoughts of a man except the spirit of the man which is in
him? Even so the thoughts of God no one knows except the Spirit of God. Now we
have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so
that we may know the things freely given to us by God,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Omnipresence </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is omnipresent. He occupies all space simultaneously

behold, You are there. If I take the wings of the dawn, If I dwell in the
remotest part of the sea, Even there Your hand will lead me, And Your right

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Omnipotence</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is omnipotent. He is all-powerful. God is limitless
ability and power. Just as He has always known everything and is everywhere at
the same time, so He has power to do anything. There is no limitation, except
whatever limitation He may interpose because of His own sovereignty. Job 42:2;

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Immutability</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is immutable. This means that God is unchangeable. He
is neither capable of nor susceptible to change. Num. 23:19; Psalms 33:11;
Psalms 102:27; Heb. 1:12; Heb. 13:8; James 1:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>““God is not a man, that He should lie, Nor a son of man, that
He should repent; Has He said, and will He not do it? Or has He spoken, and
will He not make it good?”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Numbers 23:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The counsel of the LORD stands forever, The plans of His heart
from generation to generation.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 33:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““But You are the same, And Your years will not come to an end.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms
102:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“AND LIKE A MANTLE YOU WILL ROLL THEM UP; LIKE A GARMENT THEY
WILL ALSO BE CHANGED. BUT YOU ARE THE SAME, AND YOUR YEARS WILL NOT COME TO AN

<p class=Verses>“Every good thing given and every perfect gift is from above,
coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or
shifting shadow.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(James 1:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God (the Trinity) always has and will always will have
all of His perfect and absolute attributes without the possibility of change.
Because He is immutable, He always keeps His promises. God’s immutability plus
His omnipotence means that God is always faithful. Psalms 33:11; Matt. 24:35.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The counsel of the LORD stands forever, The plans of His heart
from generation to generation.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 33:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass
away.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 24:35, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>None of God’s characteristics are subject to change.
Ever. God’s sovereignty cannot change. God’s righteousness cannot change and
become unrighteousness. He cannot be sinful. He cannot be evil, because He can
never change. His absolute righteousness (+R) cannot be diminished.  God can
never be unfair as far as His justice is concerned, it can never be changed.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God cannot be hateful, spiteful, because His love is
always constant. Due to His absolute righteousness (+R), He can and does hate
sin. God cannot be temporal life, because He is always eternal life. God cannot
be less than all powerful, all seeing and everywhere at once because God cannot
change His characteristics!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When we read in the Bible that God “repented” or “hates”
or “became angry” or “changed His mind,” these are what are called
anthropopathisms in Theology. An anthropopathism attributes to God a human
characteristic which God does not have. Anthropopathisms are use in the Bible
to as language of accommodation to reveal infinite God and explain God’s policy
toward finite mankind in terms or language that we can understand. This does
not mean that God changes, but that people change and that God must treat them
differently. See category on <a href="#_D-God’s_Immutability">God's

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Veracity</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is perfect and absolute Truth. There has never been a

2 Sam. 7:28; Psalms 33:4; Psalms 146:6; Isaiah 65:16; Titus 1:2; Heb. 6:17-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;He who has received His testimony has set his seal to

Because the former troubles are forgotten, And because they are hidden from My

<p class=Verses>“in the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie,
promised long ages ago,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Titus 1:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“In the same way God, desiring even more to show to the heirs
of the promise the unchangeableness of His purpose, interposed with an oath, so
that by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we
who have taken refuge would have strong encouragement to take hold of the hope
set before us.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 6:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>His veracity (truth) is eternal. God’s veracity is
evident in our salvation. Psalms 117:2; John 14:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For His lovingkindness is great toward us, And the truth of
the LORD is everlasting. Praise the LORD!”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 117:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Essence of God Applied</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Jesus Christ as Judge </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is God and possesses all of the attributed
of God co-equal with God the Father and God the Holy Spirit. He is absolute
righteousness (+R) and cannot be unrighteous or unfair. He is absolute justice
which makes it impossible for Him to render an incorrect or unfair decision.
Therefore, He is absolute law.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is perfect absolute love that provides the
basis for compassion in the law without violating the law. Jesus Christ is
omniscient and therefore always knows all of the facts. He is omnipresent and
therefore He is a personal witness in every case.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is immutable, so His judgments never vary or
change. They are always compatible with His character. They are always
perfectly fair and impartial judgements. Jesus Christ’s judgment of the
unbeliever illustrates God’s sovereignty, righteousness, justice, omniscience,
omnipresence, immutability, and veracity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Love of God </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s love is perfect even as God is perfect. Psalms
18:30.</p>

<p class=Verses>“As for God, His way is blameless; The word of the LORD is
tried; He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 18:30,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divine love comes from God and is based on His perfect
essence. He is sovereign and He chose to love the human race based on His
unconditional and perfect love. He is absolute righteousness (+R) and therefore
His love is perfect. He is perfect and absolute justice and therefore His love
is never unfair.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He is eternal life and is immutable. He never changes His
love. He is omniscient. He loves us even though He knows what we are thinking.
He is omnipresent. He knows what we are doing and He still loves us. He is
omnipotent. He has the ability to make us realize and understand His love. He
is veracity. He is honest in His love toward us.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Plan of God</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Salvation illustrates God’s sovereignty, love and eternal
life. Propitiation illustrates God’s sovereignty, righteousness, justice, love
and eternal life. God’s faithfulness is an illustration of His love,
immutability, and veracity. The Divine Decrees provided God’s plan and
illustrates all of His attributes, but especially His perfect sovereignty,
omniscience. See category on <a href="#_D-Divine_Decrees">Divine Decrees</a>.</p>
