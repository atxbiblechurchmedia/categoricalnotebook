<h2>Enemies of the Believer</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The world.</b> This is thinking out of fellowship that
seeks to build up self and excludes the Lord Jesus Christ. The solution is to
confess sin and return to fellowship with God. 1 John 1:9; Rom. 12:1-2; 1 John
2:15-16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
John 1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to
present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is
your spiritual service of worship. And do not be conformed to this world, but
be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the
will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
12:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do not love the world nor the things in the world. If anyone
loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the
world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of
life, is not from the Father, but is from the world.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 John
2:15-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The flesh.</b> This is the old sin nature. The
solution is to pursue righteousness or return to fellowship and stay in
fellowship. 1 John 1:9; 2 Tim. 2:22. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Now flee from youthful lusts and pursue righteousness, faith,
love and peace, with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.”  (2 Timothy
2:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now flee from youthful lusts and pursue righteousness, faith,
love and peace, with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2
Timothy 2:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Devil.</b> The Devil promotes good in the name of
good, not in the name of God. He does this through religion and legalism. This
is the Angelic Conflict. The solution is to resist via the consistent intake and
application of Bible doctrine. James 4:7; 1 Peter 5:7-9; Eph. 6:10-20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Submit therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee
from you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(James 4:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“casting all your anxiety on Him, because He cares for you. Be
of sober spirit, be on the alert. Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like
a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour. But resist him, firm in your faith,
knowing that the same experiences of suffering are being accomplished by your
brethren who are in the world.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Peter 5:7-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Pride or arrogance.</b> This is boasting of your achievements
and praising yourself in open or subtle ways. Prov. 27:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do not boast about tomorrow, For you do not know what a day
may bring forth. Let another praise you, and not your own mouth; A stranger,
and not your own lips.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 27:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Anger or uncontrolled temper.</b> The “stone” in Proverbs
27:3 stands for the obvious type of anger or the punch ‘em in the nose type of
explosive anger. The “sand” speaks of a subtle type of anger that expresses
itself by gossip, slander, vindictiveness, and retaliation. </p>

<p class=Verses>“A stone is heavy and the sand weighty, But the provocation of
a fool is heavier than both of them.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 27:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Envy and Jealousy.</b> This is worse than loss of
temper according to this verse. Ananias and Sapphira illustrated this type of
jealousy. Prov. 27:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Wrath is fierce and anger is a flood, But who can stand before
jealousy?”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 27:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Pseudo-love.</b> This the infatuated with Jesus crowd.
They are in love with love like the puppy lovers in the spring time. They gush
over Jesus and are very shallow and absolutely meaningless. These are the
Glory-Hallelujah crowd. Only personal love (<i>phileo</i>) for God and unconditional
love (<i>agapao</i>) for mankind are genuine. These are two floors in the
edification complex of the soul. Prov. 27:5-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Better is open rebuke Than love that is concealed. Faithful
are the wounds of a friend, But deceitful are the kisses of an enemy.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs
27:5-6, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Indifference to the Word of God.</b> Here, the details
of life are more important than anything else. Honey is a perfect illustration
of Bible doctrine - get it at all costs. Prov. 27:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“A sated man loathes honey, But to a famished man any bitter
thing is sweet.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 27:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>A False Scale of Values.</b> This type of believer won’t
give up their social life to get the Word. They won’t go on a crash program of
getting Bible doctrine. Therefore, they spend their time erecting a
pseudo-edification complex. Prov. 27:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Like a bird that wanders from her nest, So is a man who
wanders from his home.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 27:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>These enemies also are occupational hazards of so-called “Christian
workers,” but all are in full time Christian service, so the above is
applicable to all believers.</p>
