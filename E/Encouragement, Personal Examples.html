<h2>Encouragement, Personal Examples</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Philemon</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Philemon had a reputation of comforting other believers
and consoling them in their times of trial and difficulty. He encouraged them
and challenged them. He even corrected and rebuked them when they were out of
line. This was all done with a spirit of unconditional love. He had a
reputation for that and was a genuine source of refreshment to those believers
around him. It was always refreshing, encouraging and stimulating to be in the
presence of this mature believer. For that to be a reality in your life, you
need to understand and apply the doctrine of encouragement.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Barnabas </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Barnabas was also a positive example for everyone around
him. He did not sit around and contemplate infinity. He did not try to get into
an altered mental state. He did not possibilitize positive events or any other
apostasy or heresy which is sweeping our nation today. He did not look at
crystal power, but looked at the omnipotence of God to empower him through the
Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan really enjoys getting believers involved in these
apostasies and evil pseudo-spiritual concepts. These are sorcery and
mind-over-matter techniques to manipulate or change reality. They are evil
concepts and contrary to the Word of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Acts 4:36 and Hebrews 13:17 provide good illustrations of
Barnabas. A believer becomes an encouragement to other people when they see a
lifestyle not wrapped up in the details of life. They see a lifestyle that
truly demonstrates spiritual growth and resultant concern for other people.
They see a willingness to become involved in others’ lives and to be a source
of encouragement to them.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now Joseph, a Levite of Cyprian birth, who was also called
Barnabas by the apostles (which translated means Son of Encouragement),” (Acts
4:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch over
your souls as those who will give an account. Let them do this with joy and not
with grief, for this would be unprofitable for you.” (Hebrews 13:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Barnabas was the kind of man who was positive to Bible
doctrine and, as a mature believer, got excited when other Christians made
spiritual progress. We should be excited when people become motivated by
spiritual advance to want to evangelize. We should be excited about reaching
out to unbelievers with the Gospel of Jesus Christ. It is not the primary
responsibility of the pastor-teacher to evangelize. His primary responsibility
is to equip spiritually the believers in his local church. Eph. 4:11-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some
as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the
saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ; until
we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of
God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the
fullness of Christ. As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here
and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery
of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming;” (Ephesians 4:11-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The positive and maturing believer becomes motivated by <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine in their soul and becomes willing to reach out to others around them.
That is very encouraging to other believers. This was what Barnabas was doing
when others around him progressed spiritually. It is great to see people
getting excited when Christians are making spiritual progress and are really
entering into their ambassadorship.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Apostle Paul’s Exhortation to the Corinthian
Church</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul exhorted the Corinthian church regarding Timothy. 1
Cor. 16:10-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without cause to
be afraid, for he is doing the Lord's work, as I also am. So let no one despise
him. But send him on his way in peace, so that he may come to me; for I expect
him with the brethren.” (1 Corinthians 16:10-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Corinthian church was commended for responding to the
ministry of Titus. 2 Cor. 7:6-7; 2 Cor. 13 through 2 Cor. 14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But God, who comforts the depressed, comforted us by the
coming of Titus; and not only by his coming, but also by the comfort with which
he was comforted in you, as he reported to us your longing, your mourning, your
zeal for me; so that I rejoiced even more.” (2 Corinthians 7:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Corinthian church was admonished by Paul to receive
Titus and others ministering. Paul warns the Corinthian church concerning
reversionism. His warning was based on his desire for their edification. Paul’s
warning had a real potential of happening. 1 Corinthians bears out that they
certainly were capable of it. 2 Cor. 8:16-24; 2 Cor. 12:19-21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“All this time you have been thinking that we are defending
ourselves to you. Actually, it is in the sight of God that we have been
speaking in Christ; and all for your upbuilding, beloved. For I am afraid that
perhaps when I come I may find you to be not what I wish and may be found by
you to be not what you wish; that perhaps there will be strife, jealousy, angry
tempers, disputes, slanders, gossip, arrogance, disturbances; I am afraid that
when I come again my God may humiliate me before you, and I may mourn over many
of those who have sinned in the past and not repented of the impurity,
immorality and sensuality which they have practiced.” (2 Corinthians 12:19-21,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Edification is the preventative factor of reversionism.
Eph. 4:11-16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some
as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the
saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ; until
we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of
God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the
fullness of Christ. As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here
and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery
of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming; but speaking the truth in love, we
are to grow up in all aspects into Him who is the head, even Christ, from whom
the whole body, being fitted and held together by what every joint supplies,
according to the proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of
the body for the building up of itself in love.” (Ephesians 4:11-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The contents of reversionism can be found in 2
Corinthians 12:20. “Strife” is ἔρις (eris) and also means debates,
contention, and wrangling. “Jealousy” is ζῆλος (zēlos) and means envying,
jealous rivalry, outbursts and manifestations. “Angry tempers” is θυμός
(thumos) and means wraths, impulses and outbursts of anger, boiling up, and
soon subsiding, only to boil up again. “Disputes” is ἐριθεία (eritheia) and
means strife, and a desire to put one’s self forward. “Slanders” is καταλαλία
(katalalia) and means backbiting, and defaming someone verbally and openly.
“Gossip” is ψιθυρισμός (psithurismos) and means whispering, secret slander, a
detractor. “Arrogance” is φυσίωσις (phusiōsis) and means swelling pride, a
swelling up in the soul. “Disturbances” is ἀκαταστασία (akatastasia) and
means tumults, instability, a state of disorder, dissensions, disorders.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For I am afraid that perhaps when I come I may find you to be
not what I wish and may be found by you to be not what you wish; that perhaps
there will be strife, jealousy, angry tempers, disputes, slanders, gossip,
arrogance, disturbances;” (2 Corinthians 12:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul exhorted the Corinthians to “reaffirm your love for
him in 2 Corinthians 2:7-8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“so that on the contrary you should rather forgive and comfort
him, otherwise such a one might be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow. Wherefore I
urge you to reaffirm your love for him.” (2 Corinthians 2:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul exhorted the Corinthians to “not to receive the
grace of God in vain” in 2 Corinthians 6:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And working together with Him, we also urge you not to receive
the grace of God in vain—” (2 Corinthians 6:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul exhorted the Corinthians as to the “hazards” of the
believer. In 2 Corinthians 10:3-5, the hazard was negative volition, anything
challenging the Word of God, and doctrinal incorrectness or non-doctrinal
priorities.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to
the flesh, for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but divinely
powerful for the destruction of fortresses. We are destroying speculations and
every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God, and we are taking
every thought captive to the obedience of Christ,” (2 Corinthians 10:3-5, NASB)
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 10:7, the hazard was judging others on
outward appearance.</p>

<p class=Verses>“You are looking at things as they are outwardly. If anyone is
confident in himself that he is Christ's, let him consider this again within
himself, that just as he is Christ's, so also are we.” (2 Corinthians 10:7,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 10:10-11, the hazard was a warning as to
their attitude toward his authority in his absence.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For they say, &quot;His letters are weighty and strong, but
his personal presence is unimpressive and his speech contemptible.&quot; Let
such a person consider this, that what we are in word by letters when absent,
such persons we are also in deed when present.” (2 Corinthians 10:10-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 10:12, the hazard was a warning of the
practice of comparative ministry. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For we are not bold to class or compare ourselves with some of
those who commend themselves; but when they measure themselves by themselves
and compare themselves with themselves, they are without understanding.” (2
Corinthians 10:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 10:14-15, the hazard was a warning of
the wrong attitude toward the scope of the ministry. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For we are not overextending ourselves, as if we did not reach
to you, for we were the first to come even as far as you in the gospel of
Christ; not boasting beyond our measure, that is, in other men's labors, but
with the hope that as your faith grows, we will be, within our sphere, enlarged
even more by you,” (2 Corinthians 10:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 10:18, the hazard was a warning of self-commendation.
</p>

<p class=Verses>“For it is not he who commends himself that is approved, but he
whom the Lord commends.” (2 Corinthians 10:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 11:13-15, the hazard was a warning against
false teachers. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising
themselves as apostles of Christ. No wonder, for even Satan disguises himself
as an angel of light. Therefore it is not surprising if his servants also
disguise themselves as servants of righteousness, whose end will be according
to their deeds.” (2 Corinthians 11:13-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 12:19-21, the hazard was a warning against
reversionism. </p>

<p class=Verses>“All this time you have been thinking that we are defending
ourselves to you. Actually, it is in the sight of God that we have been
speaking in Christ; and all for your upbuilding, beloved. For I am afraid that
perhaps when I come I may find you to be not what I wish and may be found by
you to be not what you wish; that perhaps there will be strife, jealousy, angry
tempers, disputes, slanders, gossip, arrogance, disturbances; I am afraid that
when I come again my God may humiliate me before you, and I may mourn over many
of those who have sinned in the past and not repented of the impurity,
immorality and sensuality which they have practiced.” (2 Corinthians 12:19-21,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 8, the hazard was that New Testament
giving was no magic formula for solving the needs of those giving. The
Macedonians gave in their poverty but there is no indication that they
immediately prospered. Proverbs 10:4 tells us that prosperity is associated
with spiritual maturity. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Poor is he who works with a negligent hand, But the hand of
the diligent makes rich.” (Proverbs 10:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Apostle Paul’s Exhortation to the Philippian Church</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Apostle Paul’s exhortation to the Philippian Church
was based on his desire for their obedience to the Word of God, their resultant
spiritual maturity, and the outworking of God’s plan in their lives. Obedience
is not to be carried out just methodically, but in the proper way, free from
murmuring obedience with a cheerful and willing mind, and to be free also from
disputes. In Philippians 2:14, “disputing” is <span lang=EL>διαλογισμο</span>́<span
lang=EL>ς</span> (dialogismos) and is a hesitating deliberation about what
should be done, a questioning. This is the “well now” concept. Phil. 2:12-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in
my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your salvation with
fear and trembling; for it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to
work for His good pleasure. Do all things without grumbling or disputing;”
(Philippians 2:12-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Philippian church was exhorted to receive gladly the
ministries of Timothy and Epaphroditus in Philippians 2:29-30.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Receive him then in the Lord with all joy, and hold men like
him in high regard; because he came close to death for the work of Christ,
risking his life to complete what was deficient in your service to me.”
(Philippians 2:29-30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The contents of Paul’s exhortation to obedience and
maturity can be found in Philippians 2:15-16. “Blameless” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓́<span
lang=EL>μεμπτος</span><span lang=EL> </span>(amemptos) and means deserving no
censure, free from fault or defect. “Innocent” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span
lang=EL>κε</span>́<span lang=EL>ραιος</span><span lang=EL> </span>(akeraios)
and means harmless in the mind, free from guile or admixture from evil.
“Children of God” is <span lang=EL>τε</span>́<span lang=EL>κνον</span><span
lang=EL> </span><span lang=EL>θεο</span>́<span lang=EL>ς</span><span lang=EL> </span>(teknon
theos) and refers to all who are animated by the Spirit of God with emphasis on
personal relationship, not just the animation. “Above reproach” is <span
lang=EL>α</span>̓́<span lang=EL>μωμος</span> (amōmos) and means without
rebuke, ethically faultless, unblameable.</p>

<p class=Verses>“so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and
innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse
generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world, holding fast the word
of life, so that in the day of Christ I will have reason to glory because I did
not run in vain nor toil in vain.” (Philippians 2:15-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Crooked” is <span lang=EL>σκολιο</span>́<span lang=EL>ς</span>
(skolios) and means wicked. “Perverse” is <span lang=EL>διαστρε</span>́<span
lang=EL>φω</span> (diastrephō) and means perverse, corrupt and wicked. “Generation”
is <span lang=EL>γενεα</span>́ (genea) and refers to the whole multitude of people
living at the same time. “Appear” is the present middle indicative of <span
lang=EL>φαι</span>́<span lang=EL>νω</span> (phainō) and means to be bright,
resplendent. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Lights” is <span lang=EL>φωστη</span>́<span lang=EL>ρ</span>
(phōstēr) and refers to that which gives light, what the light produces. This
is production toward man and God.  “World” is <span lang=EL>κο</span>́<span
lang=EL>σμος</span> (kosmos) and refers to the world emphasizing production in
this life. “Holding fast” is the present active participle, anarthrous
construction of <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>πε</span>́<span lang=EL>χω</span>
(epechō) and emphasizes the temporal idea and also principle of life. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Word of life” is the accusative masculine singular of <span
lang=EL>λο</span>́<span lang=EL>γος</span><span lang=EL> </span><span lang=EL>ζωη</span>́
(logos zōē) and means the Word, only holding the word, the process of life, the
principle of life. “Run in vain” is the second aorist of <span lang=EL>τρε</span>́<span
lang=EL>χω</span><span lang=EL> </span><span lang=EL>κενο</span>́<span lang=EL>ς</span>
(trechō kenos) and means to run, to rapidly propagation of doctrine in vain or
to no purpose. “Toil in vain” is the aorist of <span lang=EL>κοπια</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span><span lang=EL> </span><span lang=EL>κενο</span>́<span lang=EL>ς</span>
(kopiaō kenos) and means to labor with wearisome effort, to toil in vain or to
no purpose.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Apostle Paul’s Exhortation to the Galatian
Churches</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul’s encouragement or exhortation was for the believers
in the Galatian churches to take the grace way versus the legalism way. The
basis for the encouragement to obedience is the danger of legalism. The method
of the encouragement to obedience uses a background illustration. Gal. 4:19-31.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but I could wish to be present with you now and to change my
tone, for I am perplexed about you. Tell me, you who want to be under law, do
you not listen to the law?” (Galatians 4:20-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But as at that time he who was born according to the flesh
persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so it is now also.”
(Galatians 4:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Apostle Paul’s Exhortation to the Thessalonian
Church</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul’s encouragement to the Thessalonian church can be
found in 1 Thessalonians 3:1-13. The basis of the encouragement is the presence
of great persecution. The source of the encouragement is past doctrine learned
and the arrival of Timothy.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and we sent Timothy, our brother and God's fellow worker in
the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you as to your faith,” (1
Thessalonians 3:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But now that Timothy has come to us from you, and has brought
us good news of your faith and love, and that you always think kindly of us,
longing to see us just as we also long to see you, for this reason, brethren,
in all our distress and affliction we were comforted about you through your
faith;” (1 Thessalonians 3:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul encouraged and comforted the Thessalonians when he
was there in 1 Thessalonians 2:11 through 1 Thessalonians 3:2. Encouragement
for a believer is based on knowledge of the Lord’s return for His bride at the
Rapture of the Church. 1 Thess. 4:16-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout,
with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in
Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up
together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we shall
always be with the Lord. Therefore comfort one another with these words.” (1
Thessalonians 4:16-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers have a mutual responsibility to encourage and
comfort one another. 1 Thess. 5:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore encourage one another and build up one another, just
as you also are doing.” (1 Thessalonians 5:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Encouragement and comfort is a basic ingredient of God’s
provision in grace. 2 Thess. 2:16-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself and God our Father, who
has loved us and given us eternal comfort and good hope by grace, comfort and
strengthen your hearts in every good work and word.” (2 Thessalonians 2:16-17,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Jonathan’s Encouragement of David </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At a moment of great discouragement and depression, God
used the noble Jonathan to encourage David in 1 Samuel 23:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And Jonathan, Saul's son, arose and went to David at Horesh,
and encouraged him in God.” (1 Samuel 23:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jonathan was the aggressor and David was the responder. Jonathan
was active and David was passive. The verb “to encourage” is <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>חזק</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(châzaq) and means to grow firm or
strong, to strengthen, to encourage. David was the object of the encouragement
based on Jonathan’s divine viewpoint. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God provides true friends for mature believers such as David
to stand in the gap at critical points in their lives. The complete details of
what Jonathan said are not related, but the principle of communication is Bible
doctrine and divine viewpoint from Jonathan the aggressor to David the
responder.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One area of this encouragement is recorded in 1 Samuel
23:17. Do not fear! From this verse we see the principle of encouragement from a
mature grace believer in time of tragedy or catastrophe. The grace oriented
believer never fights the plan of God. In this day when everyone is pushy and bulldogging,
the spiritually mature believers are truly relaxed.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Thus he said to him, &quot;Do not be afraid, because the hand
of Saul my father will not find you, and you will be king over Israel and I
will be next to you; and Saul my father knows that also.&quot;” (1 Samuel
23:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer that is jealous precludes any rapport love
or friendship love. The mature believer never fights the plan of God even if they
know they lose out! The grace oriented believer will always stick with a fellow
believer, especially when they have a close friendship. Their steadfastness is
truly noble.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The one who rules and has the highest rank always needs
trusted subordinates. Subordinate is not a bad word. No one is inferior because
they are subordinate. A true grace subordinate takes second place through their
own free will. To faithfully serve the Lord in a subordinate position takes
maximum use of Bible doctrine and a spiritually mature status. It is not normal
thinking as far as the old sin nature is concerned!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>David was discouraged. True friends always know when to
be an encouragement. God provides grace oriented believers to stand by when
someone is in disaster. The details of how Jonathan encouraged David are
unknown, but it was divine viewpoint. At this time, Jonathan was a more mature believer
than David.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Grace oriented spiritually mature friends are fantastic
in their help. The mature believer never fights the plan of God. David could
have avoided three revolutions if Jonathan had been there. Those in subordinate
roles need more nobility of soul than those in positions of higher authority.
Jonathan was ministering to David, not David to Jonathan.</p>
