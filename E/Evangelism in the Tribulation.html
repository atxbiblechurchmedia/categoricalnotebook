<h2><a name="_Evangelism_in_the"></a><a name="_D-Evangelism_in_the"></a>Evangelism
in the Tribulation</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Grace Always Precedes Judgment</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Salvation has always the same in every dispensation based
on faith in the Lord Jesus Christ as their Savior. Rom. 1:1-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Paul, a bond-servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle,
set apart for the gospel of God, which He promised beforehand through His
prophets in the holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, who was born of a
descendant of David according to the flesh, who was declared the Son of God
with power by the resurrection from the dead, according to the Spirit of
holiness, Jesus Christ our Lord, through whom we have received grace and
apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles for
His name's sake,” (Romans 1:1-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The opportunity of grace will exist in the Tribulation. The
Tribulation will be the most religious period of all human history. The
Tribulation will also have the greatest period of evangelism in human history.
No national entity will be omitted. Rev. 14:1-7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then I looked, and behold, the Lamb was standing on Mount
Zion, and with Him one hundred and forty-four thousand, having His name and the
name of His Father written on their foreheads.” (Revelation 14:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And I saw another angel flying in midheaven, having an eternal
gospel to preach to those who live on the earth, and to every nation and tribe
and tongue and people;” (Revelation 14:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is always a struggle between religion and
regeneration. There are the unseen struggle between demons and elect angels and
the visible struggle on earth between the forces of religion under Satan and
the forces of regeneration under the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The 144,000 Witnesses</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Age of Israel was interrupted by the Church Age. The
Tribulation will complete the last seven years of the Age of Israel. In the Age
of the Israel or the Age of the Jews, Israel was not only custodian of divine
revelation, but also was responsible for its dissemination. They utterly
failed. Now the Jews will have another chance. They will do more evangelizing
in the Tribulation than they did all of the 483 years previously in the Age of
the Israel. These Tribulational evangelists will all be Jews. Their converts
will be Gentiles. Rev. 7:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And I heard the number of those who were sealed, one hundred
and forty-four thousand sealed from every tribe of the sons of Israel:”
(Revelation 7:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Under the fifth cycle of discipline, these Jews are
scattered and will evangelize in Gentile languages. Their ministry will be
worldwide. They will be saved immediately after the Rapture. The description of
the 144,000 is given in Revelation 7:9 and Revelation 14:4. There will be
12,000 from each of the 12 tribes of Israel. Rev. 7:5-8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude
which no one could count, from every nation and all tribes and peoples and
tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white
robes, and palm branches were in their hands;” (Revelation 7:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“These are the ones who have not been defiled with women, for
they have kept themselves chaste. These are the ones who follow the Lamb
wherever He goes. These have been purchased from among men as first fruits to
God and to the Lamb.” (Revelation 14:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“from the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand were sealed, from the
tribe of Reuben twelve thousand, from the tribe of Gad twelve thousand, from
the tribe of Asher twelve thousand, from the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand,
from the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand, from the tribe of Simeon twelve
thousand, from the tribe of Levi twelve thousand, from the tribe of Issachar
twelve thousand, from the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand, from the tribe of
Joseph twelve thousand, from the tribe of Benjamin, twelve thousand were
sealed.” (Revelation 7:5-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Judah is mentioned first as the ruling tribe. Reuben
should have been mentioned first being the first born of Abraham, but he lost
the rulership to Judah. He also lost the priesthood to Levi and lost the double
portion to Joseph. Dan was omitted because it was the tribe of idolatry.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Joseph, the father, is named with Manasseh, the son, as
the double portion tribe, although it actually refers to the Tribe of Ephraim
who could not be mentioned because this tribe led in revolt against Judah.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>These tribes will be the greatest of evangelists. They
will consistently use confession of sin to remain in fellowship. They will all
be celibate males and will live under the law of supreme sacrifice and will
remain celibate. They will work together as a team. Rev. 14:4-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“These are the ones who have not been defiled with women, for
they have kept themselves chaste. These are the ones who follow the Lamb
wherever He goes. These have been purchased from among men as first fruits to
God and to the Lamb. And no lie was found in their mouth; they are blameless.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation
14:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They will be sealed. Rev. 7:3-4. They will be protected
by God and will live through the entire Tribulation. They will be protected
from the events of Revelation 6. The validity of the Gospel message will be
guaranteed just as it always has been by God’s perfect faithfulness. The
results of their evangelism are the converts found in Revelation 7:9-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“saying, &quot;Do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees
until we have sealed the bond-servants of our God on their foreheads.&quot; And
I heard the number of those who were sealed, one hundred and forty-four
thousand sealed from every tribe of the sons of Israel:” (Revelation 7:3-4,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude
which no one could count, from every nation and all tribes and peoples and
tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white
robes, and palm branches were in their hands;” (Revelation 7:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“I said to him, &quot;My lord, you know.&quot; And he said to
me, &quot;These are the ones who come out of the great tribulation, and they
have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.”
(Revelation 7:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>World-wide Evangelism</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Evangelism is maximum dissemination of the Gospel. The
Earth will be evangelized in grace four ways in the Tribulation. There will be
the ministry of the 144,000 Jews. Rev. 7:1-8; Rev. 14:1-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then I looked, and behold, the Lamb was standing on Mount
Zion, and with Him one hundred and forty-four thousand, having His name and the
name of His Father written on their foreheads. And I heard a voice from heaven,
like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder, and the voice
which I heard was like the sound of harpists playing on their harps. And they
sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the
elders; and no one could learn the song except the one hundred and forty-four
thousand who had been purchased from the earth. These are the ones who have not
been defiled with women, for they have kept themselves chaste. These are the
ones who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These have been purchased from among
men as first fruits to God and to the Lamb. And no lie was found in their
mouth; they are blameless.” (Revelation 14:1-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There will be many converts of the 144,000. Rev. 7:9-14;
Rev. 6:9; Rev. 12:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude
which no one could count, from every nation and all tribes and peoples and
tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white
robes, and palm branches were in their hands;” (Revelation 7:9, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“I said to him, &quot;My lord, you know.&quot; And he said to
me, &quot;These are the ones who come out of the great tribulation, and they
have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.”
(Revelation 7:14, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“When the Lamb broke the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar
the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God, and because
of the testimony which they had maintained;” (Revelation 6:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb
and because of the word of their testimony, and they did not love their life
even when faced with death.” (Revelation 12:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There will be the two witnesses in Jerusalem. Rev.
11:1-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;And I will grant authority to my two witnesses, and they
will prophesy for twelve hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.&quot;”
(Revelation 11:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There will be the angels who will evangelize the entire
world just prior to the Second Advent. They will probably take on human form.
It will happen only once in all of human history. Rev. 14:6-7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And I saw another angel flying in midheaven, having an eternal
gospel to preach to those who live on the earth, and to every nation and tribe
and tongue and people; and he said with a loud voice, &quot;Fear God, and give
Him glory, because the hour of His judgment has come; worship Him who made the
heaven and the earth and sea and springs of waters.&quot;” (Revelation 14:6-7,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Grace always precedes judgment. The catastrophe described
in Revelation 6 will take place only after the 144,000 Jews evangelize the
earth. There will be evangelism by disaster such as the Vial Judgments in Revelation
16 as a final thrust to awaken the religious person to their need of Jesus
Christ as Savior. This maximum pressure is bona fide evangelism, providing it
does not tamper with human volition.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There will be four categories of people in the
Tribulation. There will be believers who follow instruction and escape judgment
and believers who get on the fringe of judgment because they get involved in
ecclesiastical religion. There will be unbelievers who make a final negative
decision, receive the Mark of the Beast, and become recipients of judgments. There
will be unbelievers who have not received the Mark of the Beast, so they will
be evangelized by the judgments.</p>
