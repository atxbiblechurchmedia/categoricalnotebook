<h2>Precious Metals in an Economy</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Gold</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Gold has always been related to the economy from the
standpoint of prosperity. Private ownership of gold is biblical. Gen. 13:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver and in gold.”
(Genesis 13:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Gold is said to be good in Genesis 2:12. In Genesis 1:4,
“good” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>טוֹב</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(tob) and means
pleasant, good, agreeable, and beneficial. It is used for God’s concept of the
days of creation. </p>

<p class=Verses>“The gold of that land is good; the bdellium and the onyx stone
are there.” (Genesis 2:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light
from the darkness.” (Genesis 1:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Man was created in the vicinity of gold. Gen. 2:10-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now a river flowed out of Eden to water the garden; and from
there it divided and became four rivers. The name of the first is Pishon; it
flows around the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold. The gold of that
land is good; the bdellium and the onyx stone are there.” (Genesis 2:10-12,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In time of famine, the man with gold and silver can
purchase food. Genesis 41-44, especially chapter 44.  Israel was given silver
and gold for their 400 years of slavery as they left Egypt. Exodus 3:22; Exodus
12:35-36.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But every woman shall ask of her neighbor and the woman
who lives in her house, articles of silver and articles of gold, and clothing;
and you will put them on your sons and daughters. Thus you will plunder the
Egyptians.&quot;” (Exodus 3:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now the sons of Israel had done according to the word of
Moses, for they had requested from the Egyptians articles of silver and
articles of gold, and clothing; and the LORD had given the people favor in the
sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have their request. Thus they
plundered the Egyptians.” (Exodus 12:35-36, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Gold and silver are often mentioned in the same context.
Exodus 20:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“'You shall not make other gods besides Me; gods of silver or
gods of gold, you shall not make for yourselves.” (Exodus 20:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Much gold and silver was used in the making of the
tabernacle of worship. Exodus 25, 26, 28, 30, 31, 32, 35, 36, 37, 39. Gold and
silver have destroyed men through greed. Deut. 7:25; Deut. 8:13; Joshua 7:21;
Joshua 7:24; Joshua 6:19; Joshua 6:24.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;The graven images of their gods you are to burn with
fire; you shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it
for yourselves, or you will be snared by it, for it is an abomination to the
LORD your God.” (Deuteronomy 7:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“when I saw among the spoil a beautiful mantle from Shinar and
two hundred shekels of silver and a bar of gold fifty shekels in weight, then I
coveted them and took them; and behold, they are concealed in the earth inside
my tent with the silver underneath it.&quot;” (Joshua 7:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“They burned the city with fire, and all that was in it. Only
the silver and gold, and articles of bronze and iron, they put into the
treasury of the house of the LORD.” (Joshua 6:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Due to David’s fantastic prosperity, Solomon had large
amounts of gold with which to build the temple. 1 Kings 6 through 1 Kings 10. Gold
is used as a true illustration of character in Job 23:10. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But He knows the way I take; When He has tried me, I
shall come forth as gold.” (Job 23:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As valuable as gold is, Bible doctrine is more valuable.
Psalms 19:9-10; Psalms 119:72; Prov. 3:13-15. </p>

<p class=Verses>“The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring forever; The judgments
of the LORD are true; they are righteous altogether. They are more desirable
than gold, yes, than much fine gold; Sweeter also than honey and the drippings
of the honeycomb.” (Psalms 19:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The law of Your mouth is better to me Than thousands of gold
and silver pieces.” (Psalms 119:72, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“How blessed is the man who finds wisdom And the man who gains
understanding. For her profit is better than the profit of silver And her gain
better than fine gold. She is more precious than jewels; And nothing you desire
compares with her.” (Proverbs 3:13-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Gold is used to describe the courtship in Song of Solomon
5:11 and Song of Solomon 5:14-15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;His head is like gold, pure gold; His locks are like
clusters of dates And black as a raven.” (Song of Solomon 5:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;His hands are rods of gold Set with beryl; His abdomen
is carved ivory Inlaid with sapphires. &quot;His legs are pillars of alabaster
Set on pedestals of pure gold; His appearance is like Lebanon Choice as the
cedars.” (Song of Solomon 5:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Gold and silver in a nation does not in itself mean
greatness. There must be spiritual maturity to achieve true greatness. People
usually can’t take prosperity! Isaiah 2:7-8. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Their land has also been filled with silver and gold And there
is no end to their treasures; Their land has also been filled with horses And
there is no end to their chariots. Their land has also been filled with idols;
They worship the work of their hands, That which their fingers have made.”
(Isaiah 2:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To trust in silver and gold alone for economic
deliverance is not the answer. Obedience to the Word of God is a thousand times
better. Ezekiel 7:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“'They will fling their silver into the streets and their gold
will become an abhorrent thing; their silver and their gold will not be able to
deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD. They cannot satisfy their
appetite nor can they fill their stomachs, for their iniquity has become an
occasion of stumbling.” (Ezekiel 7:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At least one nation in history, Babylon, has been called
the head of gold. Dan. 2:32-38.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;The head of that statue was made of fine gold, its
breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of bronze,” (Daniel
2:32, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“and wherever the sons of men dwell, or the beasts of the
field, or the birds of the sky, He has given them into your hand and has caused
you to rule over them all. You are the head of gold.” (Daniel 2:38, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ was given a gift of gold in Matthew 2:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“After coming into the house they saw the Child with Mary His
mother; and they fell to the ground and worshiped Him. Then, opening their
treasures, they presented to Him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.”
(Matthew 2:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Gold, silver, and precious stones are used as an
illustration of spiritual production in 1 Corinthians 3:12. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold, silver,
precious stones, wood, hay, straw,” (1 Corinthians 3:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Gold cannot buy favor with God. Our faith is much more
precious than gold. James 5:3; 1 Peter 1:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Your gold and your silver have rusted; and their rust will be
a witness against you and will consume your flesh like fire. It is in the last
days that you have stored up your treasure!” (James 5:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“so that the proof of your faith, being more precious than gold
which is perishable, even though tested by fire, may be found to result in
praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ;” (1 Peter 1:7,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Millennium and in eternity, gold will be
prominently in evidence. Rev. 21:18; Rev. 21:21. </p>

<p class=Verses>“The material of the wall was jasper; and the city was pure
gold, like clear glass.” (Revelation 21:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the gates
was a single pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent
glass.” (Revelation 21:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Silver</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Silver is regarded as valuable, the possession of it
indicating true prosperity. Silver was used in a real estate transaction in
Genesis 23 and Joshua 24:32.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now they buried the bones of Joseph, which the sons of Israel
brought up from Egypt, at Shechem, in the piece of ground which Jacob had
bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for one hundred pieces of
money; and they became the inheritance of Joseph's sons.” (Joshua 24:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Lord’s type of prosperity mentioned specifically in
the Bible can include greatness in society, livestock (agrarian economy),
silver, gold, servants, camels (means of transportation), donkeys (means of
hauling materials), and transfer of property to the son. Gen. 24:35-36.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;The LORD has greatly blessed my master, so that he has
become rich; and He has given him flocks and herds, and silver and gold, and
servants and maids, and camels and donkeys. &quot;Now Sarah my master's wife
bore a son to my master in her old age, and he has given him all that he has.”
(Genesis 24:35-36, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The possession of silver and gold was proof of being able
to support a wife and pay the dowry in Genesis 24:53.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The servant brought out articles of silver and articles of
gold, and garments, and gave them to Rebekah; he also gave precious things to
her brother and to her mother.” (Genesis 24:53, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The possession of silver and gold enabled Jacob and his
sons to purchase food in times of famine. Gen. 44:1-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then he commanded his house steward, saying, &quot;Fill the
men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man's money in
the mouth of his sack. &quot;Put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the
sack of the youngest, and his money for the grain.&quot; And he did as Joseph
had told him. As soon as it was light, the men were sent away, they with their
donkeys. They had just gone out of the city, and were not far off, when Joseph
said to his house steward, &quot;Up, follow the men; and when you overtake
them, say to them, 'Why have you repaid evil for good? 'Is not this the one
from which my lord drinks and which he indeed uses for divination? You have
done wrong in doing this.'&quot; So he overtook them and spoke these words to
them.” (Genesis 44:1-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The ability to give gifts of silver was a mark of true
prosperity and good will. Gen. 45:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“To each of them he gave changes of garments, but to Benjamin
he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of garments.” (Genesis
45:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Back wages for 400 years of slavery were paid by the
Egyptians in silver and gold. The wealth of a family was controlled by the
woman in Egypt. Exodus 3:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But every woman shall ask of her neighbor and the woman
who lives in her house, articles of silver and articles of gold, and clothing;
and you will put them on your sons and daughters. Thus you will plunder the
Egyptians.&quot;” (Exodus 3:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Silver can be used in the program of Satan. Exodus 20:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“'You shall not make other gods besides Me; gods of silver or
gods of gold, you shall not make for yourselves.” (Exodus 20:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Silver was a major building material in the tabernacle
and the temple. Books of Exodus and Numbers. Kings in the Old Testament were
told to not multiply four things to themselves: horses, wives, silver and gold.
Horses caused a lot of unnecessary details of life, wives were associated with
false religions, and silver and gold could result in prosperity without proper
priorities. Deut. 17:16-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Moreover, he shall not multiply horses for himself, nor
shall he cause the people to return to Egypt to multiply horses, since the LORD
has said to you, 'You shall never again return that way.' &quot;He shall not
multiply wives for himself, or else his heart will turn away; nor shall he
greatly increase silver and gold for himself.” (Deuteronomy 17:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Silver can generate greed and cause defeat in battle. Silver
and gold were often the wages paid soldiers in battle as they lived off the
enemy they plundered. Joshua 6:19; Joshua 6:24; Joshua 7:21-24.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But all the silver and gold and articles of bronze and
iron are holy to the LORD; they shall go into the treasury of the LORD.&quot;”
(Joshua 6:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“They burned the city with fire, and all that was in it. Only
the silver and gold, and articles of bronze and iron, they put into the
treasury of the house of the LORD.” (Joshua 6:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“when I saw among the spoil a beautiful mantle from Shinar and
two hundred shekels of silver and a bar of gold fifty shekels in weight, then I
coveted them and took them; and behold, they are concealed in the earth inside
my tent with the silver underneath it.&quot;” (Joshua 7:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Silver was used to buy men for evil purposes in the
conspiracy of Abimelech. Judges 9:4. </p>

<p class=Verses>“They gave him seventy pieces of silver from the house of
Baal-berith with which Abimelech hired worthless and reckless fellows, and they
followed him.” (Judges 9:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Silver was behind the work of Delilah in stripping Samson
of his strength. Those with whom you have sex can and often do influence you. Judges
16:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The lords of the Philistines came up to her and said to her,
&quot;Entice him, and see where his great strength lies and how we may
overpower him that we may bind him to afflict him. Then we will each give you
eleven hundred pieces of silver.&quot;” (Judges 16:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Silver has been an object of thievery. A son that had
stolen from his mother. Judges 17:1-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He said to his mother, &quot;The eleven hundred pieces of
silver which were taken from you, about which you uttered a curse in my
hearing, behold, the silver is with me; I took it.&quot; And his mother said,
&quot;Blessed be my son by the LORD.&quot;” (Judges 17:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Silver has always been used to try to buy the favor of
God and to serve in a religious way. Judges 17:8-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Micah then said to him, &quot;Dwell with me and be a father
and a priest to me, and I will give you ten pieces of silver a year, a suit of
clothes, and your maintenance.&quot; So the Levite went in.” (Judges 17:10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Nationalism and great riches of silver and gold is the
concept of 1 Kings 10:1ff.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now when the queen of Sheba heard about the fame of Solomon
concerning the name of the LORD, she came to test him with difficult questions.
So she came to Jerusalem with a very large retinue, with camels carrying spices
and very much gold and precious stones. When she came to Solomon, she spoke
with him about all that was in her heart.” (1 Kings 10:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Great famine can cause terrific inflation, but the man
who had the silver could always eat. 2 Kings 6:25. </p>

<p class=Verses>“There was a great famine in Samaria; and behold, they besieged
it, until a donkey's head was sold for eighty shekels of silver, and a fourth
of a kab of dove's dung for five shekels of silver.” (2 Kings 6:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Nations plunder nations for gold and silver. When a
nation is plundered, the victorious nation takes away the defeated nation’s
treasures. 2 Kings 18:13-16; 2 Kings 25:11-15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king
of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and seized them.
Then Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria at Lachish, saying,
&quot;I have done wrong. Withdraw from me; whatever you impose on me I will
bear.&quot; So the king of Assyria required of Hezekiah king of Judah three
hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.” (2 Kings 18:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The captain of the guard also took away the firepans and the
basins, what was fine gold and what was fine silver.” (2 Kings 25:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the ownership of gold and silver, security and privacy
is very important. Hezekiah played the part of the fool in showing treasure to
the men of Babylon. The one with the gold has the power. 2 Kings 20:12-19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“At that time Berodach-baladan a son of Baladan, king of
Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah, for he heard that Hezekiah had
been sick. Hezekiah listened to them, and showed them all his treasure house,
the silver and the gold and the spices and the precious oil and the house of
his armor and all that was found in his treasuries. There was nothing in his
house nor in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them.” (2 Kings
20:12-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Illustrations of honesty with silver are found in the Word
of God. 2 Kings 22:3-7. Note verse 7 and repairing of the temple under good king
Josiah.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, the king sent
Shaphan, the son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam the scribe, to the house of
the LORD saying, &quot;Go up to Hilkiah the high priest that he may count the
money brought in to the house of the LORD which the doorkeepers have gathered
from the people.” (2 Kings 22:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Only no accounting shall be made with them for the money
delivered into their hands, for they deal faithfully.&quot;” (2 Kings 22:7,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Gold was always much more valuable than silver. 2 Kings
23:33. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Pharaoh Neco imprisoned him at Riblah in the land of Hamath,
that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and he imposed on the land a fine of one
hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.” (2 Kings 23:33, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Gold and silver were used to pay taxes in Israel. 2 Kings
23:34-37.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So Jehoiakim gave the silver and gold to Pharaoh, but he taxed
the land in order to give the money at the command of Pharaoh. He exacted the
silver and gold from the people of the land, each according to his valuation,
to give it to Pharaoh Neco.” (2 Kings 23:35, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When the 5th cycle of discipline was over for the Jews,
the wealth was taken back into the land. Ezra 1. </p>
