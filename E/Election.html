<h2><a name="_D-Election"></a><a name="_Election"></a>Election</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Election means to be selected, chosen, and set apart for
privilege. Election is God’s plan for believers only. Unbelievers are never
said to be elect. God in His foreknowledge knew, in eternity past before
creation itself, that if man was given free will, some would express their free
will by faith in the substitutionary work of Jesus Christ on the Cross, thereby
gaining an eternal relationship with Him. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s foreknowledge is a subset of His omniscience and
includes all that actually will occur in human history. God’s omniscience
includes all knowledge of the universe, angels, and human history. It includes
all that could occur, all that would occur, and all that did not occur or never
will occur.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is the only person elected from eternity
past. The term “my servant” in Isaiah 42:1 refers to the Lord Jesus Christ. “My
chosen” refers to Jesus Christ as the elected one. In 1 Peter 2:6, “a precious
corner stone” also refers to the Jesus Christ as the elected one.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Behold, My Servant, whom I uphold; My chosen one in whom My
soul delights. I have put My Spirit upon Him; He will bring forth justice to
the nations.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah 42:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this is contained in Scripture: “BEHOLD, I LAY IN ZION A
CHOICE STONE, A PRECIOUS CORNER stone, AND HE WHO BELIEVES IN HIM WILL NOT BE
DISAPPOINTED.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Peter 2:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This election took place in eternity past. Eph. 1:4; 2
Tim. 1:9; 1 Peter 1:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world,
that we would be holy and blameless before Him. In love”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians
1:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not
according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace which was
granted us in Christ Jesus from all eternity,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Timothy 1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by the
sanctifying work of the Spirit, to obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with His
blood: May grace and peace be yours in the fullest measure.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Peter 1:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Election is a present possession as well as a future
possession of all Church Age believers due to our position in Christ. Every
believer shares Christ’s election. Col. 3:12; Rom. 8:28-33.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So, as those who have been chosen of God, holy and beloved,
put on a heart of compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Colossians
3:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And we know that God causes all things to work together for
good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.
For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the
image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many brethren; and
these whom He predestined, He also called; and these whom He called, He also
justified; and these whom He justified, He also glorified. What then shall we
say to these things? If God is for us, who is against us? He who did not spare
His own Son, but delivered Him over for us all, how will He not also with Him
freely give us all things? Who will bring a charge against God’s elect? God is
the one who justifies;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 8:28-33, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Election takes place at the moment of salvation through
belief in the work of Jesus Christ. 1 Cor. 1:9; 1 Cor. 1:23-24; 1 Cor. 1:26-28;
2 Thess. 2:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“God is faithful, through whom you were called into fellowship
with His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block and
to Gentiles foolishness, but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks,
Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians
1:23-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For consider your calling, brethren, that there were not many
wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble; but God has
chosen the foolish things of the world to shame the wise, and God has chosen
the weak things of the world to shame the things which are strong, and the base
things of the world and the despised God has chosen, the things that are not,
so that He may nullify the things that are,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 1:26-28,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But we should always give thanks to God for you, brethren
beloved by the Lord, because God has chosen you from the beginning for
salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and faith in the truth.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2
Thessalonians 2:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Election is the foundation of the Church. Election is
based on grace. Election is the basis of facing suffering with blessing. 1
Thess. 1:3-4; Gal. 1:6; Rom. 8:28-30.</p>

<p class=Verses>“constantly bearing in mind your work of faith and labor of
love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the presence of our
God and Father, knowing, brethren beloved by God, His choice of you;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Thessalonians 1:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“I am amazed that you are so quickly deserting Him who called
you by the grace of Christ, for a different gospel;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Galatians 1:6,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And we know that God causes all things to work together for
good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.
For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the
image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many brethren; and
these whom He predestined, He also called; and these whom He called, He also
justified; and these whom He justified, He also glorified.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
8:28-30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Predestination is the other side of the coin. Christ is
predestined. We are in Christ. We share His destiny. Christ is elected “chosen.”
We chose Christ from our free will in a non-meritorious act of faith. Because
we are then in union with Christ, we are chosen or elected in Him. We share
everything He has including His destiny, which includes His predestination. See
category on <a href="#_Union_with_Jesus">Union with Jesus Christ</a>. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Case for Election </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Word of God sets up principles such as grace. God
does not violate these principles. In eternity past, God the Father always had a
purpose in Christ Jesus - the plan of God via grace. Eph. 3:11; Eph. 2:8-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“This was in accordance with the eternal purpose which He
carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 3:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not
of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one
may boast.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 2:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The plan of God includes Positional Truth for Church Age
believers based on believers being placed into union with Christ by the Holy
Spirit at salvation. Jesus Christ also indwells every believer. The believer is
in the Body of Christ via the Baptism of the Holy Spirit. John 14:20; 1 Cor.
12:13. </p>

<p class=Verses>““In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in
Me, and I in you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 14:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether
Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one
Spirit.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 12:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>By being in union with Christ, you share what Christ has
and is. We share;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>His life. 1
John 5:11-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the testimony is this, that God has given us eternal life,
and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has the life; he who does not
have the Son of God does not have the life.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 John 5:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>His
righteousness (+R). 2 Cor. 5:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that
we might become the righteousness of God in Him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Corinthians
5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>His sonship.
Gal. 3:26; John 1:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Galatians
3:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to
become children of God, even to those who believe in His name,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John
1:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>His priesthood.
1 Peter 2:5; 1 Peter 2:9. </p>

<p class=Verses>“you also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual
house for a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
through Jesus Christ.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Peter 2:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But you are A CHOSEN RACE, A royal PRIESTHOOD, A HOLY NATION,
A PEOPLE FOR God’s OWN POSSESSION, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of
Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Peter 2:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>His rulership.
Col. 1:13; 2 Peter 1:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For He rescued us from the domain of darkness, and transferred
us to the kingdom of His beloved Son,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Colossians 1:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“for in this way the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be abundantly supplied to you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2
Peter 1:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>His heirship.
Rom. 8:16-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are
children of God, and if children, heirs also, heirs of God and fellow heirs
with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him so that we may also be glorified with
Him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 8:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>His
sanctification. 1 Cor. 1:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“To the church of God which is at Corinth, to those who have
been sanctified in Christ Jesus, saints by calling, with all who in every place
call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours:”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Corinthians 1:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>His election. 1
Peter 1:2; Eph. 1:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by the
sanctifying work of the Spirit, to obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with His
blood: May grace and peace be yours in the fullest measure.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Peter 1:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world,
that we would be holy and blameless before Him. In love”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians
1:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:0in'>His destiny.
Eph. 1:5; Eph. 1:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to
Himself, according to the kind intention of His will,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians
1:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“also we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined
according to His purpose who works all things after the counsel of His will,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians
1:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Christ is the elected one, the predestined one. We as
Church Age believers share His election and His destiny by choosing for Christ,
by faith. Isaiah 42:1; 1 Peter 2:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Behold, My Servant, whom I uphold; My chosen one in whom My
soul delights. I have put My Spirit upon Him; He will bring forth justice to
the nations.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah 42:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this is contained in Scripture: “BEHOLD, I LAY IN ZION A
CHOICE STONE, A PRECIOUS CORNER stone, AND HE WHO BELIEVES IN HIM WILL NOT BE
DISAPPOINTED.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Peter 2:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>From Eternity Past, you are “chosen in Christ.” “Chosen
in Christ” is the plan of God. You share this plan by choosing Christ. The plan
was given us before the world began.  2 Thess. 2:13; 2 Tim. 1:9; 1 Peter 1:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But we should always give thanks to God for you, brethren
beloved by the Lord, because God has chosen you from the beginning for
salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and faith in the truth.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2
Thessalonians 2:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not
according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace which was
granted us in Christ Jesus from all eternity,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Timothy 1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by the
sanctifying work of the Spirit, to obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with His
blood: May grace and peace be yours in the fullest measure.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Peter 1:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ephesians 1:2-14 speaks of the purpose of God’s plan in
eternity past. Faith is a principle set up in the Word of God. Faith is
non-meritorious because the merit is always in the object of your faith.
Salvation is by faith in Jesus Christ. The principle of grace and of the free
will of man is set forth in Scripture after Scripture.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ,
just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be
holy and blameless before Him. In love He predestined us to adoption as sons
through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will,
to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely bestowed on us in the
Beloved.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 1:3-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness
of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace which He lavished on
us. In all wisdom and insight”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 1:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“also we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined
according to His purpose who works all things after the counsel of His will, to
the end that we who were the first to hope in Christ would be to the praise of
His glory.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 1:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“In Him, you also, after listening to the message of truth, the
gospel of your salvation—having also believed, you were sealed in Him with the
Holy Spirit of promise, who is given as a pledge of our inheritance, with a
view to the redemption of God’s own possession, to the praise of His glory.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians
1:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The character of God (His fairness, His righteousness,
His perfection, His justice) is set forth in Scripture after Scripture. Psalms
145:17; Psalms 18:30; Deut. 32:4; 2 Chron. 19:7; Psalms 89:14; Rom. 3:26.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD is righteous in all His ways And kind in all His
deeds.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 145:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“As for God, His way is blameless; The word of the LORD is
tried; He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 18:30,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““The Rock! His work is perfect, For all His ways are just; A
God of faithfulness and without injustice, Righteous and upright is He.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Deuteronomy
32:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““Now then let the fear of the LORD be upon you; be very
careful what you do, for the LORD our God will have no part in unrighteousness
or partiality or the taking of a bribe.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Chronicles 19:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne;
Lovingkindness and truth go before You.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 89:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“for the demonstration, I say, of His righteousness at the
present time, so that He would be just and the justifier of the one who has
faith in Jesus.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 3:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The false theory that anyone is predestinated to hell or
heaven without the right of choice is incompatible with the principle of grace
and the character of God. Such false views make a farce of the grace plan of
God and they impugn the character of God especially His perfect righteousness (+R)
and Justice. 2 Peter 3:9; Rom. 10:13; 2 Chron. 19:7</p>

<p class=Verses>“The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some count
slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing for any to perish but for all
to come to repentance.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Peter 3:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“for “WHOEVER WILL CALL ON THE NAME OF THE LORD WILL BE SAVED.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
10:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““Now then let the fear of the LORD be upon you; be very
careful what you do, for the LORD our God will have no part in unrighteousness
or partiality or the taking of a bribe.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Chronicles 19:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God gives every member of the human race a choice. John
3:16; John 6:44; John 12:32; Isaiah 53:5-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>““For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten
Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John
3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws
him; and I will raise him up on the last day.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 6:44, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to
Myself.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 12:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But He was pierced through for our transgressions, He was
crushed for our iniquities; The chastening for our well-being fell upon Him,
And by His scourging we are healed. All of us like sheep have gone astray, Each
of us has turned to his own way; But the LORD has caused the iniquity of us all
To fall on Him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah 53:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are all free to avail ourselves of Jesus Christ and
His being judged for our sins. Do not be caught in the debater’s trap of taking
one verse (which perhaps you do not understand completely) to try and prove a
theory that is in opposition to the principles set forth in Scripture after
Scripture is the Word of God, or that is not compatible with the character of
God. 1 Thess. 5:21</p>

<p class=Verses>“But examine everything carefully; hold fast to that which is
good;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Thessalonians 5:21, NASB) </p>
