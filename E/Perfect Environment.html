<h2>Perfect Environment </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the beginning of man’s history, we had perfect
environment on earth for an unknown length of time. At the end of man’s history
(the Millennium) we will have perfect environment for 1,000 years. In the Garden,
Satan came into man’s perfect environment and helped to destroy it. Gen. 3. At
the end of the Millennium, Satan comes into perfect environment and stirs up a
revolt. Rev. 20:3; Rev. 20:7-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and he threw him into the abyss, and shut it and sealed it
over him, so that he would not deceive the nations any longer, until the
thousand years were completed; after these things he must be released for a
short time.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation 20:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“When the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released
from his prison, and will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four
corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for the war; the
number of them is like the sand of the seashore. And they came up on the broad
plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city,
and fire came down from heaven and devoured them. And the devil who deceived
them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the
false prophet are also; and they will be tormented day and night forever and
ever.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation 20:7-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Man’s volition was involved in the destruction of perfect
environment in the Garden. Man’s volition will be involved in the revolt at the
end of the Millennium. Perfect environment did not solve man’s problem in the
Garden. Perfect environment will not solve man’s problem in the Millennium. The
only answer is regeneration of salvation and then the spiritual growth from the
intake and application of Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the end of the Millennium, unbelievers with old sin
natures will join Satan’s revolt even though they have had 1,000 years of
perfect environment. Perfect environment does not improve the old sin nature.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Revolt at the beginning of time was on a personal basis.
Revolt at the end of time will be on a mass basis. The reason for the
Millennium is to prove again that perfect environment is not the answer. The
unbeliever cannot appreciate or enjoy perfect environment. Doctrine in your
frontal lobe creates a perfect environment that goes with you. 1 Cor. 2:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of
God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because
they are spiritually appraised.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 2:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There will be perfect environment in eternity. It will be
beneficial because you have believers in resurrection bodies minus the old sin
nature. In order to start out with perfect environment, there must removal of
religion, of Satan the father of religion, demons, and unbelievers. Rev.
20:2-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And he laid hold of the dragon, the serpent of old, who is the
devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years; and he threw him into the
abyss, and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he would not deceive the
nations any longer, until the thousand years were completed; after these things
he must be released for a short time.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation 20:2-3, NASB)</p>
