<h2><a name="_D-Eternity"></a><a name="_Eternity"></a>Eternity</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Very little is known about eternity. The original
creation of heaven and earth is described in Genesis 1:1 and 2 Peter 3:5. </p>

<p class=Verses>“In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis
1:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For when they maintain this, it escapes their notice that by
the word of God the heavens existed long ago and the earth was formed out of
water and by water,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Peter 3:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Holy Spirit’s restoration of the earth is described
in Genesis 1:3-31. The universe in which we now live is going to be completely
destroyed by fire. 2 Peter 3:5-13; Rev. 21:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But by His word the present heavens and earth are being
reserved for fire, kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2
Peter 3:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, in which the
heavens will pass away with a roar and the elements will be destroyed with
intense heat, and the earth and its works will be burned up.” (2 Peter 3:10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven
and the first earth passed away, and there is no longer any sea.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation
21:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The new heavens and new earth is described in Revelation
21:1 and 2 Peter 3:13. The “new heaven” will be residence of the Church or all
Church Age believers, although the New Jerusalem will play an important part in
our eternal home. The reason is that Jesus Christ will headquarter there and we
are the Bride of Christ.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven
and the first earth passed away, and there is no longer any sea.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation
21:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But according to His promise we are looking for new heavens
and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Peter 3:13,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The “new earth” will be the residence of Israel. This is
the fulfillment of the Abraham and Palestinian Covenant. Land was specifically
promised to Abraham and his descendants forever. The eternal aspect of the
promises brings a new earth in the picture. Three characteristics of the
eternal state and Jesus Christ will be present and accessible to all. There
will be perfect happiness and perpetual newness. Rev. 21:3-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And I heard a loud voice from the throne, saying, “Behold, the
tabernacle of God is among men, and He will dwell among them, and they shall be
His people, and God Himself will be among them, and He will wipe away every
tear from their eyes; and there will no longer be any death; there will no
longer be any mourning, or crying, or pain; the first things have passed away.”
And He who sits on the throne said, “Behold, I am making all things new.” And
He said, “Write, for these words are faithful and true.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation
21:3-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There will be nations in eternity as a memorial to the grace
of God in preserving the human race so they could be born-again. Nationalism is
the basic principle of survival for the human race. The New Jerusalem which
comes from God arrives as a completed package. Apparently it is suspended above
the earth and will be headquarters for the universe of eternity and the
personal residence of the Lord Jesus Christ. The New Jerusalem fulfills a
promise from the faithfulness of God to Abraham and is still unfulfilled. The
Abraham lived in a tent, died in a tent, and was promised a city in the future.
Heb. 11:9-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“By faith he lived as an alien in the land of promise, as in a
foreign land, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow heirs of the same
promise; for he was looking for the city which has foundations, whose architect
and builder is God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 11:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Holy City of Eternity illustrates something of the
glory of eternity. The description of the New Jerusalem is in Revelation 21:9
through Revelation 22:5. Multiply this by infinity and you have a picture of
the eternal state.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of
the seven last plagues came and spoke with me, saying, “Come here, I will show
you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.” And he carried me away in the Spirit to a
great and high mountain, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down
out of heaven from God, having the glory of God. Her brilliance was like a very
costly stone, as a stone of crystal-clear jasper. It had a great and high wall,
with twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels; and names were written on
them, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation
21:9-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then he showed me a river of the water of life, clear as
crystal, coming from the throne of God and of the Lamb, in the middle of its
street. On either side of the river was the tree of life, bearing twelve kinds
of fruit, yielding its fruit every month; and the leaves of the tree were for
the healing of the nations. There will no longer be any curse; and the throne
of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and His bond-servants will serve Him;
they will see His face, and His name will be on their foreheads. And there will
no longer be any night; and they will not have need of the light of a lamp nor
the light of the sun, because the Lord God will illumine them; and they will
reign forever and ever.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation 22:1-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Angels guard the gates. Regenerate man in their position
now and later also in resurrection body is and will remain higher than angels. The
Eternal State thus is indescribably beautiful.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Comparison of Heaven and Hell</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The eternal state will be a very different place for the
residence of believers when compared to unbelievers. A comparison of heaven and
hell below amplifies these differences.</p>

prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself, that
where I am, there you may be also. “And you know the way where I am going.”
Thomas *said to Him, “Lord, we do not know where You are going, how do we know
the way?” Jesus *said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no
one comes to the Father but through Me.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 14:1-6, NASB)</p>

14:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Eternal State for the Believer and Unbeliever</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Man’s initial relationship to God is one of the creature
to the Creator. God is the God of the whole human race by virtue of creation,
whether acknowledged or not. He is not the Father of the human race, only of
those who believe. Jer. 32:27; Gal. 3:26.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh; is anything too
difficult for Me?”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jeremiah 32:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Galatians
3:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Man is a living soul. All souls belong to God. Gen. 2:7; Ezek.
18:4; Dan. 5:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD God formed man of dust from the ground, and
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis
2:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““Behold, all souls are Mine; the soul of the father as well as
the soul of the son is Mine. The soul who sins will die.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ezekiel
18:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“but you have exalted yourself against the Lord of heaven; and
they have brought the vessels of His house before you, and you and your nobles,
your wives and your concubines have been drinking wine from them; and you have
praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood and stone, which do
not see, hear or understand. But the God in whose hand are your life-breath and
all your ways, you have not glorified.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Daniel 5:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Man’s eternal relationship with God is determined by his
response to God’s offer of salvation by faith alone in Jesus Christ. John 3:36.</p>

<p class=Verses>““He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who does
not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(John
3:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are two kinds of people in the human race: believer
and unbeliever - saved souls and lost souls. There are two possible destinations
- a place of bliss for believers (John 14:1-3 and Rev. 21:1 - Rev. 22:7) and a
place of torment (torture) for unbelievers. Luke 16:19-31; Rev. 20:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Do not let your heart be troubled; believe in God, believe
also in Me. “In My Father’s house are many dwelling places; if it were not so,
I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you. “If I go and
prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself, that
where I am, there you may be also.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 14:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of
heaven from God, made ready as a bride adorned for her husband.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation
21:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then He said to me, “It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega,
the beginning and the end. I will give to the one who thirsts from the spring
of the water of life without cost.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation 21:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““In Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torment, and *saw
Abraham far away and Lazarus in his bosom. “And he cried out and said, ‘Father
Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus so that he may dip the tip of his
finger in water and cool off my tongue, for I am in agony in this flame.’“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Luke
16:23-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And if anyone’s name was not found written in the book of
life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation 20:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 5:29, the believer anticipates “a resurrection to
life” where the “good” is acceptance of Jesus Christ and “evil” is rejection of
Jesus Christ. </p>

<p class=Verses>“and will come forth; those who did the good deeds to a
resurrection of life, those who committed the evil deeds to a resurrection of
judgment.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 5:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer anticipates a “very much better” place (Phil.
1:23), eternity in the very presence of God (2 Cor. 5:8), an inheritance
reserved in heaven, (1 Peter 1:4) and a reunion with loved ones in the Lord (1
Thess. 4:16-17).</p>

Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up
together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we shall
always be with the Lord.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Thessalonians 4:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The unbeliever faces eternity separated completely from
God with a “resurrection of judgment” body to reside in the Lake of Fire
forever. John 5:29; Matt. 25:41; Rev. 20:15; Rev. 21:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>““But for the cowardly and unbelieving and abominable and

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer’s soul is stabilized as they live the
spiritual life on earth by gaining <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the soul.
Acts 14:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to
continue in the faith, and saying, “Through many tribulations we must enter the
kingdom of God.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 14:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In eternity, the believer’s soul is delivered by
receiving a resurrection body that has no sin nature. 2 Cor. 5:8; Phil. 3:21. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Believer’s Hope</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer’s hope is that we know facts concerning
eternity. When we die, we will be absent from the body and immediately face to
face with the Lord. 2 Cor. 5:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“we are of good courage, I say, and prefer rather to be absent
from the body and to be at home with the Lord.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Corinthians 5:8,

9:27-28.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once and after
this comes judgment, so Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins
of many, will appear a second time for salvation without reference to sin, to
those who eagerly await Him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 9:27-28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We will have a new home, a new dwelling place. John
14:1-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Do not let your heart be troubled; believe in God, believe
also in Me. “In My Father’s house are many dwelling places; if it were not so,
I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you. “If I go and
prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself, that
where I am, there you may be also.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 14:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We have an eternal inheritance. 1 Peter 1:4-5.</p>

power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last
time.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Peter 1:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There will be no more sorrow, no more tears. Rev. 21:4.</p>

will no longer be any death; there will no longer be any mourning, or crying,
or pain; the first things have passed away.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation 21:4,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Will have a resurrection body with which we will live
with Jesus Christ forever. 1 Thess. 4:16-18; Phil. 3:21; 1 John 3:1-2; 1 Cor.
15:51-57; Phil. 1:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“See how great a love the Father has bestowed on us, that we

appears, we will be like Him, because we will see Him just as He is.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Characteristics of Eternal Home with Christ</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Revelation 21:1, it says that there will be no more
sea. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first
heaven and the first earth passed away, and there is no longer any sea.&quot; 
(Revelation 21:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ will dwell among all believer in
resurrection bodies forever. There will no longer be any tears, death, sorrow,
or pain. No one will have an old sin nature in eternity. There can be no sin or
production of human good. There will be no world system of Satan as we know it
today. Our bodies will be perfect, everlasting, and indestructible. Satan and
all of his demons will be in the Lake of Fire, so they can never deceive again.
Rev. 21:3-4.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And I heard a loud voice from the throne, saying,
&quot;Behold, the tabernacle of God is among men, and He will dwell among them,
and they shall be His people, and God Himself will be among them, and He will
wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there will no longer be any death;
there will no longer be any mourning, or crying, or pain; the first things have
passed away.&quot;&quot;  (Revelation 21:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>In Revelation 21:5, “making all
things new” means no corrosion, rust, rot, decay, mold, or fungus. Nothing will
decay. It will all remain perfect. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He who sits on the throne said, &quot;Behold, I am
making all things new.&quot; And He *said, &quot;Write, for these words are
faithful and true.&quot;&quot;  (Revelation 21:5, NASB)</p>

abominable and murderers and immoral persons and sorcerers and idolaters and
all liars, their part will be in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone,
which is the second death.&quot;&quot;  (Revelation 21:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>The New Jerusalem is described in
Revelation 21:2 and Revelation 21:10.</p>

<p class=Verses> &quot;And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out
of heaven from God, made ready as a bride adorned for her husband.&quot; 
(Revelation 21:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high
mountain, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven
from God,&quot;  (Revelation 21:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>There will be no sun or moon, but
the light will be everywhere coming from Jesus Christ Himself. That means there
will be no night. Rev. 21:23; Rev. 22:5; Rev. 21:25.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And the city has no need of the sun or of the moon to
shine on it, for the glory of God has illumined it, and its lamp is the
Lamb.&quot;  (Revelation 21:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And there will no longer be any night; and they will not
have need of the light of a lamp nor the light of the sun, because the Lord God
will illumine them; and they will reign forever and ever.&quot;  (Revelation
22:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;In the daytime (for there will be no night there) its
gates will never be closed;&quot;  (Revelation 21:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>There will be separate nations.
Rev. 21:24. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the
earth will bring their glory into it.&quot;  (Revelation 21:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>There will be a river and a
street (street is singular not plural) with the tree of life on either side. Rev.
22:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then he showed me a river of the water of life, clear as
crystal, coming from the throne of God and of the Lamb, in the middle of its
street. On either side of the river was the tree of life, bearing twelve kinds
of fruit, yielding its fruit every month; and the leaves of the tree were for
the healing of the nations.&quot;  (Revelation 22:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>There will not be any curse or
any law that cannot be kept. There will also be Christian service and
rulership. Rev. 22:3-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;There will no longer be any curse; and the throne of God
and of the Lamb will be in it, and His bond-servants will serve Him; they will
see His face, and His name will be on their foreheads. And there will no longer
be any night; and they will not have need of the light of a lamp nor the light
of the sun, because the Lord God will illumine them; and they will reign
forever and ever.&quot;  (Revelation 22:3-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Christ is behind our hope. He suffered as our substitute
on the Cross. Communion reminds us of the suffering of Christ. There is
national suffering. There is family suffering. There is personal suffering. There
are many reasons by believers suffer, but the plan of God is bigger than
anything life can throw your way, if you keep in fellowship, in communion with
the Lord.</p>
