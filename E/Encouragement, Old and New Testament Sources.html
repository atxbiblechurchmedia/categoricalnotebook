<h2>Encouragement, Old and New Testament Sources</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>New Testament Sources</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Church Age, the Holy Spirit is the ultimate source
of encouragement<i> </i>for all believers. Every believer has the permanent
indwelling of the Spirit, the filling of the Spirit, the ministry of the Spirit
in teaching, learning, mentoring, and applying Bible doctrine. From the <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine in your soul, you counsel yourself, you comfort yourself, you
warn yourself, you advise yourself. The believer is commanded to continue in
learning Bible doctrine from their pastor‑teacher. 2 Peter 3:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and
Savior Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory, both now and to the day of eternity.
Amen.&quot;  (2 Peter 3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Encouragement comes to a person through the communication
of doctrine. 1 Cor. 14:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But one who prophesies speaks to men for edification and
exhortation and consolation.” (1 Corinthians 14:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Encouragement is based on our position in Christ. Phil.
2:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is
any consolation of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any
affection and compassion,” (Philippians 2:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Exhorting and encouraging was to be a part of the regular
ministry of Titus. 1 Tim. 4:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Until I come, give attention to the public reading of
Scripture, to exhortation and teaching.” (1 Timothy 4:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Encouragement under chastening comes by knowing that this
is an expression of love of the Father and done for your betterment. Heb. 12:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and you have forgotten the exhortation which is addressed to
you as sons, &quot;MY SON, DO NOT REGARD LIGHTLY THE DISCIPLINE OF THE LORD,
NOR FAINT WHEN YOU ARE REPROVED BY HIM;” (Hebrews 12:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Jewish believers were encouraged to accept the
written word of Paul to them in Hebrews 13:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But I urge you, brethren, bear with this word of exhortation,
for I have written to you briefly.” (Hebrews 13:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Consolation or comfort or encouragement based on
possessions, things, and experiences are often more detrimental than helpful.
Luke 6:24; Luke 16:25.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But woe to you who are rich, for you are receiving your
comfort in full.” (Luke 6:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But Abraham said, 'Child, remember that during your life
you received your good things, and likewise Lazarus bad things; but now he is
being comforted here, and you are in agony.” (Luke 16:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul had a deep inner encouragement and comfort through
his relationship with the Corinthian believers. 2 Cor. 7:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Great is my confidence in you; great is my boasting on your
behalf. I am filled with comfort; I am overflowing with joy in all our
affliction.” (2 Corinthians 7:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Real true comfort and encouragement come through the
Scriptures. Rom. 15:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now may the God who gives perseverance and encouragement grant
you to be of the same mind with one another according to Christ Jesus,” (Romans
15:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Comfort and encouragement come directly through the
ministry of the Holy Spirit. One has to be in fellowship to benefit from this
ministry. Acts 9:31.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria
enjoyed peace, being built up; and going on in the fear of the Lord and in the
comfort of the Holy Spirit, it continued to increase.” (Acts 9:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers are often comforted and encouraged by those in
worse circumstances than themselves. Acts 16:40.</p>

<p class=Verses>“They went out of the prison and entered the house of Lydia,
and when they saw the brethren, they encouraged them and departed.” (Acts
16:40, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are comforted and encouraged that we might be able to
comfort others. 2 Cor. 1:3-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the
Father of mercies and God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our affliction
so that we will be able to comfort those who are in any affliction with the
comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.” (2 Corinthians 1:3-4,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A believer who has caused grief and later changed, should
be encouraged so as to not cause them personal grief. 2 Cor. 2:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“so that on the contrary you should rather forgive and comfort
him, otherwise such a one might be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.” (2
Corinthians 2:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul was encouraged and lifted up by the arrival of
Titus. 2 Cor. 7:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But God, who comforts the depressed, comforted us by the
coming of Titus;” (2 Corinthians 7:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul had been comforted by the response of the
Corinthians to his ministry. 2 Cor. 7:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason we have been comforted. And besides our
comfort, we rejoiced even much more for the joy of Titus, because his spirit
has been refreshed by you all.” (2 Corinthians 7:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A state of comfort or encouragement is enjoined upon
believers. It should be pursued. 2 Cor. 13:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Finally, brethren, rejoice, be made complete, be comforted, be
like-minded, live in peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you.” (2
Corinthians 13:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul sent Tychicus to Ephesus to reveal Paul’s state of
affairs that it might be an encouragement to them. Eph. 6:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I have sent him to you for this very purpose, so that you may
know about us, and that he may comfort your hearts.” (Ephesians 6:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul sent Tychicus to Colossae to comfort and encourage
them. Col. 4:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may
know about our circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts;”
(Colossians 4:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Old Testament
Sources</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Moses was commanded to encourage Joshua in Deuteronomy
3:28.</p>

<p class=Verses>“'But charge Joshua and encourage him and strengthen him, for
he shall go across at the head of this people, and he will give them as an
inheritance the land which you will see.'” (Deuteronomy 3:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>People were told by Moses to encourage Joshua in
Deuteronomy 1:38. The hiphil of <span lang=AR-SA dir=RTL>חזק</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (châzaq) means to cause to be encouraged.
</p>

<p class=Verses>“'Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, he shall enter
there; encourage him, for he will cause Israel to inherit it.” (Deuteronomy
1:38, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Encouragement was given to Joshua in leadership in Deuteronomy
31:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then He commissioned Joshua the son of Nun, and said, &quot;Be
strong and courageous, for you shall bring the sons of Israel into the land
which I swore to them, and I will be with you.&quot;” (Deuteronomy 31:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>People encouraged each other in their work in Isaiah
41:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So the craftsman encourages the smelter, And he who smooths
metal with the hammer encourages him who beats the anvil, Saying of the
soldering, &quot;It is good&quot;; And he fastens it with nails, So that it
will not totter.” (Isaiah 41:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Men of Israel encouraged themselves and went back into
battle in Judges 20:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the people, the men of Israel, encouraged themselves and
arrayed for battle again in the place where they had arrayed themselves the
first day.” (Judges 20:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>David encouraged himself in the Lord his God in 1 Samuel
30:6 and Psalms 18:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Moreover David was greatly distressed because the people spoke
of stoning him, for all the people were embittered, each one because of his
sons and his daughters. But David strengthened himself in the LORD his God.” (1
Samuel 30:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“In my distress I called upon the LORD, And cried to my God for
help; He heard my voice out of His temple, And my cry for help before Him came
into His ears.” (Psalms 18:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Israel was encouraged in view of their relationship to
God in 1 Chronicles 19:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Be strong, and let us show ourselves courageous for the
sake of our people and for the cities of our God; and may the LORD do what is
good in His sight.&quot;” (1 Chronicles 19:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Provision was made for the priests and Levites that they
might be encouraged in 2 Chronicles 31:3-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He also appointed the king's portion of his goods for the
burnt offerings, namely, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the
burnt offerings for the sabbaths and for the new moons and for the fixed
festivals, as it is written in the law of the LORD. Also he commanded the
people who lived in Jerusalem to give the portion due to the priests and the
Levites, that they might devote themselves to the law of the LORD. As soon as
the order spread, the sons of Israel provided in abundance the first fruits of
grain, new wine, oil, honey and of all the produce of the field; and they
brought in abundantly the tithe of all.” (2 Chronicles 31:3-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Priests were encouraged by the king to do their functions
in the house of the Lord in 2 Chronicles 35:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Josiah celebrated the Passover to the LORD in Jerusalem,
and they slaughtered the Passover animals on the fourteenth day of the first
month. He set the priests in their offices and encouraged them in the service
of the house of the LORD.” (2 Chronicles 35:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Israelites were encouraged to fulfill their
responsibilities of the application of doctrine in Ezra 10:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Arise! For this matter is your responsibility, but we
will be with you; be courageous and act.&quot;” (Ezra 10:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The courage of the believer will be given added strength
in function according to Psalms 31:24.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Be strong and let your heart take courage, All you who hope in
the LORD.” (Psalms 31:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Encouragement is based on God’s promises and His
character in Deuteronomy 31:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Be strong and courageous, do not be afraid or tremble at
them, for the LORD your God is the one who goes with you. He will not fail you
or forsake you.&quot;” (Deuteronomy 31:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Encouragement is a must because of the responsibilities
at stake. Deut. 31:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then Moses called to Joshua and said to him in the sight of
all Israel, &quot;Be strong and courageous, for you shall go with this people
into the land which the LORD has sworn to their fathers to give them, and you
shall give it to them as an inheritance.” (Deuteronomy 31:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Encouragement is given as a promise of blessing and to
stay on course in Joshua 1:6-7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Be strong and courageous, for you shall give this people
possession of the land which I swore to their fathers to give them. &quot;Only
be strong and very courageous; be careful to do according to all the law which
Moses My servant commanded you; do not turn from it to the right or to the
left, so that you may have success wherever you go.” (Joshua 1:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Encouragement is based on God’s continued presence in
Joshua 1:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous! Do
not tremble or be dismayed, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you
go.&quot;” (Joshua 1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Encouragement is based on the fact that the battle is the
Lord’s. It doesn’t depend on you. Joshua 10:25.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Joshua then said to them, &quot;Do not fear or be dismayed! Be
strong and courageous, for thus the LORD will do to all your enemies with whom
you fight.&quot;” (Joshua 10:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Encouragement is based on the immutability of God. 1
Chron. 28:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then David said to his son Solomon, &quot;Be strong and
courageous, and act; do not fear nor be dismayed, for the LORD God, my God, is
with you. He will not fail you nor forsake you until all the work for the
service of the house of the LORD is finished.” (1 Chronicles 28:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Encouragement is also from knowing that God is on your
side. 2 Chron. 32:7-8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Be strong and courageous, do not fear or be dismayed
because of the king of Assyria nor because of all the horde that is with him;
for the one with us is greater than the one with him. &quot;With him is only an
arm of flesh, but with us is the LORD our God to help us and to fight our
battles.&quot; And the people relied on the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.”
(2 Chronicles 32:7-8, NASB)</p>
