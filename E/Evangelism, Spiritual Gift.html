<h2><a name="_Evangelism,_Spiritual_Gift"></a>Evangelism, Spiritual Gift</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The permanent spiritual gift of evangelism is the second
of the two communication gifts conveyed by God the Holy Spirit at the point of
salvation to only a few male believers in the Church Age. God does the choosing
and is according to God’s plan in eternity past. In Ephesians 4:11, “evangelist”
is <span lang=EL>ευ</span>̓<span lang=EL>αγγελιστη</span>́<span lang=EL>ς</span>
(euaggelistēs) and means a messenger of good. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and
some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers,&quot;  (Ephesians 4:11,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This communication gift gives the evangelist the ability
to gain the attention of crowds. He goes from place to place, town to town,
preaching the Gospel. People get saved through the function of this gift. The
evangelist gives people the Gospel, then basic Bible doctrine and moves on to a
new area. The evangelist must accurately and clearly present the issue of the
Gospel, otherwise gaining the attention of the crowd becomes spiritually
meaningless. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>While the gift of pastor-teacher communicates the whole
realm of Bible doctrine inside the local church, the gift of evangelism
communicates the Gospel and related Bible doctrine outside the local church.
The evangelist is to be conversant with the whole counsel of God. The
evangelist must be able to give an explanation of basic Bible doctrines to the
new believers they encounter.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The purpose of the gift of evangelism is to bring the
Gospel to all nations. The scope of the gift means the evangelist is
responsible for pre-evangelism, evangelism, and post-evangelism up to and
including the doctrine of water baptism. Upon performing the function of water
baptism, the evangelist turns the new believer over to his pastor-teacher in
the local church. Matt. 28:19-20.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;Go therefore and make disciples of all the
nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy
Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I commanded you; and lo, I am with
you always, even to the end of the age.&quot; &quot;  (Matthew 28:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Evangelists must study the culture of the people they are
going to visit and they have to know the background of the people to whom they
are going to present the Gospel. They have to learn something about the
original languages of the Bible and have a good working knowledge of Bible doctrine
and Theology because when they evangelize, they also teach basic Bible truth.
As in all leadership spiritual gifts, preparation is very important. God graces
out every believer at the moment of salvation with talents and abilities that
He determines will be best for that believer.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Content of the Spiritual Gift</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The male believer with the gift of evangelism has the
God-given ability to communicate the Gospel in such a way that he can hold the
unbeliever's attention. This spiritual gift allows the one using the gift to
assemble many people to listen to the presentation of the Gospel. These
unbelievers will give their attention and listen to the evangelist where they
would not listen to anyone else. While listening to something “religious,” the
unbeliever often is on their guard and can be resentful. All of this is overcome
by the spiritual gift of evangelism by bringing the individuals to
God-consciousness while then communicating the Gospel. Rom. 10:13-21.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;How then will they call on Him in whom they have not
believed? How will they believe in Him whom they have not heard? And how will
they hear without a preacher? How will they preach unless they are sent? Just
as it is written, &quot;HOW BEAUTIFUL ARE THE FEET OF THOSE WHO BRING GOOD NEWS
OF GOOD THINGS!&quot;&quot;  (Romans 10:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But I say, surely they have never heard, have they?
Indeed they have; &quot;THEIR VOICE HAS GONE OUT INTO ALL THE EARTH, AND THEIR
WORDS TO THE ENDS OF THE WORLD.&quot;&quot;  (Romans 10:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And Isaiah is very bold and says, &quot;I WAS FOUND BY
THOSE WHO DID NOT SEEK ME, I BECAME MANIFEST TO THOSE WHO DID NOT ASK FOR
ME.&quot;&quot;  (Romans 10:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The evangelist gift is designed to reach the unreachable
with the Gospel message of salvation. The gift of evangelism provides the
ability to teach and express the Gospel so that unbelievers will have a clear
understanding of the issue of salvation. The evangelist usually has a speaking
talent that goes with his gift, but it is the spiritual gift that provides
hearing from the unbeliever. When this spiritual gift functions, the unbeliever
will listen to the Gospel.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The evangelist has the responsibility to follow-up on
basic Bible doctrine to the point of baptizing the convert. He will teach the
significance of the Cross, the believer’s permanent union with Jesus Christ and
the believer’s temporal fellowship. He will teach positional truth. He will
teach biblical confession of sin using 1 John 1:9. He will teach faith-rest. He
will teach how divine good is produced. Then, he will turn the new believer
over to a categorical pastor-teacher in one of several ways. He may start a
church with the converts. A “traveling” pastor-teacher may come. Matt.
28:18-20. </p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, &quot;All
authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. &quot;Go therefore and
make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and
the Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I commanded you;
and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.&quot; &quot; 
(Matthew 28:18-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher will then start teaching basic Bible
doctrine. He will teach them how to recover the filling of the Holy Spirit and
how to become grace oriented. He will teach them the basics until a permanent
pastor-teacher arrives on the scene or the evangelist will refer the believer
to a local church in the area that teaches Bible doctrine and grace.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Contrast Between the Gift of Evangelism and the Gift
of Pastor-Teacher</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The evangelist has a burning desire to see souls won to
Christ and leads souls to Christ. The pastor-teacher will have a burning desire
to see his sheep walk in truth. 3 John 1:4.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I have no greater joy than this, to hear of my children
walking in the truth.&quot;  (3 John 1:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The evangelist in the function of his ministry deals with
unbelievers, whereas the pastor-teacher deals with believers. Eph. 4:12; Matt.
28:18-20.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;for the equipping of the saints for the work of service,
to the building up of the body of Christ;&quot;  (Ephesians 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, &quot;All
authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. &quot;Go therefore and
make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and
the Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I commanded you;
and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.&quot; &quot; 
(Matthew 28:18-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The evangelist deals with communicating the Gospel of
Jesus Christ and teaching basic Bible doctrine, whereas the pastor-teacher
deals with teaching the whole counsel of Bible doctrine. The evangelist may
know as much Bible doctrine as a pastor-teacher, but his gift does not enable
him to communicate it as a shepherd of the flock. The evangelist upon occasion
can do the “work of a pastor” and the pastor the “work of an evangelist.” 2 Tim.
4:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But you, be sober in all things, endure hardship, do the
work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.&quot;  (2 Timothy 4:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Timothy 4:5, the verbs “be, endure, do, and fulfill”
are all aorist active imperatives and are therefore commands from God.
“Fulfill” is <span lang=EL>πληροφορε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(plērophoreō) and means to bear or bring full, to make full, to cause a thing
to be shown to the full, to fulfil the ministry in every part.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The evangelist, however is not to pastor a local church
for any length of time. This is the ministry of the pastor-teacher. The
evangelist visits, goes out to wherever the unbelievers are. The pastor-teacher
does not visit, his gift demands that he be in one place in a local church
studying and teaching. See books of 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, and Titus.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>However the evangelist comes in two packages - one that
constantly travels and has mass meetings and one that stays stationary and
works a local community or region from a local church. Both will always have a
home church where the pastor-teacher keeps him straight.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The evangelist uses much one-on-one method (personal
work) in his ministry. The pastor-teacher does not use a one-on-one method, but
ministers in public assembly under the doctrine of privacy. The evangelist will
always look at the word of God from the standpoint of his spiritual gift and
how he can be equipped to reach the unbeliever. The pastor-teacher will always
look at the Word of God from the standpoint of his spiritual gift and how he
can build up a believer in the faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Occupational Hazards of the Gift of Evangelism</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One occupational hazard of the gift of evangelism is to
try to make everyone into evangelists. Another is trying to get everyone to win
souls as the prime purpose of the Christian life. Another hazard is building
the entire body of Bible doctrine in the Word around evangelism such as
spirituality, growth and spiritual maturity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Another hazard is not studying enough and having four or
five canned messages, or 10 or 12 and doing reruns night after night. Another
occupational hazard of the gift of evangelism is not having a home church that
will put him under a pastor-teacher who will keep him doctrinally straight.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Other occupational hazards include getting into the
snares of Christian celebrity time (big name speakerism--or the foreign Bible
teacher), mass promotions, promoting self with portfolio of statistics,
travels, etc., not handling finances correctly, and getting so big you cannot
control your team. The reward of the gift is in Daniel 12:3 and 1 Peter 5:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Those who have insight will shine brightly like the
brightness of the expanse of heaven, and those who lead the many to
righteousness, like the stars forever and ever.&quot;  (Daniel 12:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the
unfading crown of glory.&quot;  (1 Peter 5:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Evangelism in the Early Church</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The secret to power and production in the early church
was Bible doctrine. They knew doctrine, they disseminated doctrine daily, they
made the issue clear and became controversial. The impact of Christianity
depends upon knowing the content of Bible doctrine, teaching it from the
spiritual gift, and staying consistently in the filling of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This statement in Acts 5:28 was made by the high priest,
leader of the opposition, not Peter or one of the apostles. The significance
was that the unbeliever, the opposition, recognizes the impact of Christianity
only when doctrine is taught. The word “filled” is the perfect active
indicative of <span lang=EL>πληρο</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (plēroō) and
means to make full, to fill up, to complete. This was the result of daily
teaching evangelism and daily teaching edification.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;saying, &quot;We gave you strict orders not to continue
teaching in this name, and yet, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching
and intend to bring this man's blood upon us.&quot;&quot;  (Acts 5:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is no Christianity in the tongues crowd today.
There is no Christianity in the modern healing groups. There is no Christianity
where people are having super-duper experiences, thinking by so doing they are
super-saints. The impact of evangelism and Christianity lies in Bible doctrine.
It is the Word of God that is alive and powerful and the content of the Word is
doctrine and the opposition even recognizes real power. The religious crowd is
more concerned about their reputation rather than salvation. They are more
concerned about their safety than they are about the issue of Christ. Heb.
4:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any
two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of
both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the
heart.” (Hebrews 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Evangelism in Paul’s Ministry</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The evangelistic imperative is to identify with a local
church, know Jesus Christ as your personal Savior, evangelize, instruct new
converts, perform water baptism, and identify the convert with a
pastor-teacher.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The evangelistic pattern is Paul. Paul (then Saul) manifested
negative volition as un unbeliever and manifested the religious attitude toward
Christianity. Acts 9:1. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the
disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest,&quot;  (Acts 9:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul observed Christ as light in whom is no darkness at
all. The issue in evangelism is Christ. Therefore, the message of evangelism
surrounds Christ from Genesis 3 to the present. You have to be rough with some
to get their attention. Paul was one of them. Acts 9:3-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;As he was traveling, it happened that he was approaching
Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him; and he fell to
the ground and heard a voice saying to him, &quot;Saul, Saul, why are you
persecuting Me?&quot; &quot;  (Acts 9:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul hit positive signals at Acts 9:5-6. He was very
hardened by religion and by legalism. For the unbeliever, how hard will you
have to be hit before you will give the Gospel a hearing? Loss of health,
wealth success, loved ones, etc.? The word “persecuting” is the present active
indicative of <span lang=EL>διω</span>́<span lang=EL>κω</span> (diōkō) and
means to persecute, to be mistreated, suffer persecution on account of
something.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And he said, &quot;Who are You, Lord?&quot; And He said,
&quot;I am Jesus whom you are persecuting, but get up and enter the city, and
it will be told you what you must do.&quot; &quot;  (Acts 9:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers are in Christ and therefore when a believer is
persecuted, Christ is persecuted. This is the doctrine of positional truth.
Paul was saved. This was a transitional period for Paul. God-consciousness plus
positive signals means God is going to provide information. Positive volition
expresses itself by faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. 1 Tim. 1:16; John 7:17;
Acts 17:27; Jer. 29:13. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Yet for this reason I found mercy, so that in me as the
foremost, Jesus Christ might demonstrate His perfect patience as an example for
those who would believe in Him for eternal life.&quot;  (1 Timothy 1:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;If anyone is willing to do His will, he will know
of the teaching, whether it is of God or whether I speak from Myself. &quot; 
(John 7:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;that they would seek God, if perhaps they might grope for
Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us;&quot;  (Acts 17:27,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;'You will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with
all your heart.&quot;  (Jeremiah 29:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Evangelism’s Testimony </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The following expressions are used in connection with
giving the Gospel. In Matthew 4:23 and Galatians 2:2, “proclaiming” is <span
lang=EL>κηρυ</span>́<span lang=EL>σσω</span> (kērussō) and means to publish,
proclaim, to be exhibited as a daily newspaper. To make the message available.
To communicate an available message. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Jesus was going throughout all Galilee, teaching in their
synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every kind of
disease and every kind of sickness among the people.&quot;  (Matthew 4:23,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;It was because of a revelation that I went up; and I
submitted to them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but I did so in
private to those who were of reputation, for fear that I might be running, or
had run, in vain.&quot;  (Galatians 2:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Thessalonians 2:2, “to speak” is <span lang=EL>λαλε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (laleō) and means to speak, to talk, to proclaim in a
conversational tone, to clearly communicate the message. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;but after we had already suffered and been mistreated in
Philippi, as you know, we had the boldness in our God to speak to you the
gospel of God amid much opposition.&quot;  (1 Thessalonians 2:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 20:24, “testify” is <span lang=EL>διαμαρτυ</span>́<span
lang=EL>ρομαι</span> (diamarturomai) and means to thoroughly teach the message,
to attest, testify to, solemnly affirm. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;But I do not consider my life of any account as
dear to myself, so that I may finish my course and the ministry which I
received from the Lord Jesus, to testify solemnly of the gospel of the grace of
God.&quot;  (Acts 20:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 15:1, Corinthians 11:7, and Galatians
1:11, “preached” is <span lang=EL>ευ</span>̓<span lang=EL>αγγελι</span>́<span
lang=EL>ζω</span> (euaggelizō) and means to communicate a good message, to
proclaim glad tidings.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now I make known to you, brethren, the gospel which I
preached to you, which also you received, in which also you stand,&quot;  (1
Corinthians 15:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Or did I commit a sin in humbling myself so that you
might be exalted, because I preached the gospel of God to you without
charge?&quot;  (2 Corinthians 11:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For I would have you know, brethren, that the gospel
which was preached by me is not according to man.&quot;  (Galatians 1:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 9:14, “proclaim” is <span lang=EL>καταγγε</span>́<span
lang=EL>λλω</span> (kataggellō) and means to communicate the Gospel in a
negative situation, to denounce. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So also the Lord directed those who proclaim the gospel
to get their living from the gospel.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 9:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Philippians 2:22,  “served” is <span lang=EL>δουλευ</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (douleuō) and means to communicate the Gospel in a team
relationship, father-son, Paul-Timothy. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But you know of his proven worth, that he served with me
in the furtherance of the gospel like a child serving his father.&quot; 
(Philippians 2:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Philippians 4:3, “struggle” is <span lang=EL>συναθλε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (sunathleō) and means to communicate the Gospel in a team
relationship intensively. Emphasis on the energy it took to communicate it -
hardship. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Indeed, true companion, I ask you also to help these
women who have shared my struggle in the cause of the gospel, together with
Clement also and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of
life.&quot;  (Philippians 4:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 15:16, “minister” is <span lang=EL>ι</span>̔<span
lang=EL>ερουργε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (hierourgeō) and means to
minister in priestly service, a sacrificing priest, from <i>ieros</i> (sacred)
and <i>ergon</i> (work). To communicate the Gospel in a technical sense, in
Jewish jargon. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles,
ministering as a priest the gospel of God, so that my offering of the Gentiles
may become acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.&quot;  (Romans 15:16,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 15:19, the word “filled” is <span lang=EL>πληρο</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (plēroō) and means to make full, to fill up, to complete to
fully communicate the Gospel. This was the result of daily teaching evangelism
and daily teaching edification.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;saying, &quot;We gave you strict orders not to continue
teaching in this name, and yet, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching
and intend to bring this man's blood upon us.&quot;&quot;  (Acts 5:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Timothy 1:8, the word “suffering” is <span lang=EL>συγκακοπαθε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (sugkakopatheō) and means to suffer hardship together with
one. To communicate the Gospel, you will be identified with undeserved
suffering. What did I do to deserve this? </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord
or of me His prisoner, but join with me in suffering for the gospel according
to the power of God,&quot;  (2 Timothy 1:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Evangelism’s Reception </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The following expressions are used in connection with
receiving the Gospel. In 2 Corinthians 11:4, the verb “accepted” is <span
lang=EL>δε</span>́<span lang=EL>χομαι</span> (dechomai) and is used in a false
sense. It means to take hold of, to take up, to receive. This verb is used in a
good sense in Martha receiving Christ. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For if one comes and preaches another Jesus whom we have
not preached, or you receive a different spirit which you have not received, or
a different gospel which you have not accepted, you bear this
beautifully.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 11:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 10:16, the word “heed” is <span lang=EL>υ</span>̔<span
lang=EL>πακου</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (hupakouō) and means to listen,
concentrate, to obey, be obedient to, submit to. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;However, they did not all heed the good news; for Isaiah
says, &quot;LORD, WHO HAS BELIEVED OUR REPORT?&quot;&quot;  (Romans 10:16,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Mark 1:15 and Acts 16:31, the word “believe” is the
aorist active imperative of <span lang=EL>πιστευ</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(pisteuō) and means saving faith, to believe, to place confidence and truth
in. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and saying, &quot;The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom
of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel.&quot; &quot;  (Mark 1:15,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;They said, &quot;Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will
be saved, you and your household.&quot;&quot;  (Acts 16:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Galatians 1:7, the word “distort” is <span lang=EL>μεταστρε</span>́<span
lang=EL>φω</span> (metastrephō) and means to change the character, to distort the
divine viewpoint Gospel to a human viewpoint gospel. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;which is really not another; only there are some who are
disturbing you and want to distort the gospel of Christ.&quot;  (Galatians 1:7,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Personal Evangelism</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Although we may not all have the gift of evangelism, we
are all commanded to do the work of an evangelist. Timothy was a
pastor-teacher, yet he was commanded to do the work of an evangelist. 2 Tim.
4:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But you, be sober in all things, endure hardship, do the
work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.&quot;  (2 Timothy 4:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All believers are mandated by God to evangelize because
we are royal ambassadors for Jesus Christ. As such, every believer represents
God before the human race. Therefore, we are personally to witness for Christ
and give the message of reconciliation as opportunities present themselves. The
gift of evangelism must be distinguished from personal witnessing, which is the
responsibility of every believer. 2 Cor. 5:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;namely, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to
Himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and He has committed to us
the word of reconciliation.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 5:19, NASB)</p>
