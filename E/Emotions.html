<h2><a name="_D-Emotions"></a><a name="_Emotions"></a>Emotions</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Emotion is defined as <span style='background:white'>a
conscious mental reaction subjectively experienced as strong feeling usually
directed toward a specific object and typically accompanied by physiological
and behavioral changes in the body. It is also defined as a state of feeling or
the affective aspect of consciousness. Emotions are a part of your soul.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Emotion appears when there is some hindrance to soothe
and complete execution or satisfaction of one’s instincts and this stimulates
the nervous system and feelings. Emotions are a stimuli for action, and
therefore, must be regarded as a form of human energy. Emotional stress, for
example, causes people to act on impulse. The emotion of fear, also a sin,
causes flight.  The emotion of disgust causes repulsion. The emotion of anger
causes violence.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Instincts are reflex behaviors based on emotion rather
than on thought. Emotions are affects or feeling functions. If how you feel
becomes the criterion for your life, you will never be able to execute God’s
plan as a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Emotions is a system of response and feeling. Emotion
does not contain thought, the ability to reason, any common sense, any
vocabulary as a tool for mental function, or doctrinal content. Emotion is
related to human power and influence, but never to divine power and influence. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Emotion and the Christian Way of Life </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is no spiritual activity in emotion. It is a normal
or abnormal physiological or psychological activity, but how you feel has
nothing to do with your spiritual status. How you feel has nothing to do with
any factor in the spiritual life. If you take your emotions and ecstatic
experiences and try to include them into God’s plan, you have entered into a
form of blasphemy. Under some conditions, the use of doctrine in recall or
application often causes an emotional response. You are using your thinking to
recall, apply, and believe a doctrine, and your emotions respond. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>But when you become involved in that evil which makes
emotion the criterion for the spiritual life, you are grieving and quenching
the Holy Spirit. You are not utilizing the power of God. There is no divine
power in emotion. The power is in thought, and that thought must be Bible
doctrine or divine wisdom. Elation and ecstatics are not related to the filling
of the Spirit, they are the expression of emotion.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Certain kinds of emotions are sins such as anger, rage,
fear, and anxiety. Hate is an irrational emotion and is a sin.  Hatred,
resentment, dejection, and defeat are emotional activities. You cannot apply
emotion or its results (anger, fear, worry, hatred, anxiety, murder) to the
problems of life and come up with solutions. All you have by applying these
emotional sins to the problems of life is nothing, or worse, the manufacture of
greater problems, such as murder.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ecstasy is an emotional mood often associated with
spirituality. But you can be either ecstatic or depressed, but still be
spiritual.  The filling of the Spirit is entirely separate from your emotions
and must be separated from them in your thinking. From ecstasy there is also a
tranquil sense of power which is often associated or identified with the
spiritual life, but it is not.  Ecstasy represents maximum wish fulfillment,
but it is not related in any way to the spiritual life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Depression and heightened concern regarding personal
problems is an emotional expression where the believer is out of fellowship.
Emotion has no spiritual connotation. Tension is the function of emotion in
both restlessness and dissatisfaction. Anxiety is heightened or disrupted
tension, an emotional state minus any doctrine. Fear and panic are emotional.
Panic is not merely a high degree of fear, but fear based on prolonged tension.
Insecurity from ignorance of doctrine is emotional, not spiritual.  Depersonalization
is the emotion or feeling of unreality which so many believers seem to have
today.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Emotion is physiological, not spiritual. Emotion is
related to human power under certain conditions, or human failure under certain
conditions, but it is never a part of the spiritual life. Emotion is to be
enjoyed, understood and evaluated, but this is impossible without the absolute
criterion for the Christian way of life - The Word of God, Bible doctrine. Emotion
is not the criterion in the Christian way of life. Emotionalism is a substitute
for ignorance of the Word of God. Use objectivity based on Bible doctrine to
determine whether you are filled with the Holy Spirit. Emotion has a place in
your life. Emotion is the appreciator of the soul. Song of Solomon 1:7; John
12:27; 2 Peter 2:8; Luke 12:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Tell me, O you whom my soul loves, Where do you pasture your
flock, Where do you make it lie down at noon? For why should I be like one who
veils herself Beside the flocks of your companions?”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Song of
Solomon 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““Now My soul has become troubled; and what shall I say, ‘Father,
save Me from this hour’? But for this purpose I came to this hour.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John
12:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“(for by what he saw and heard that righteous man, while living
among them, felt his righteous soul tormented day after day by their lawless
deeds),”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Peter 2:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“‘And I will say to my soul, “Soul, you have many goods laid up
for many years to come; take your ease, eat, drink and be merry.”‘“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Luke
12:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When you are born-again, this information is communicated
to your soul. You may or may not have emotion. Your emotion has nothing to do
with the spiritual reality of your salvation. Emotionalism is only soulish
human activity, unless controlled by the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When emotions respond to the Bible doctrine in the right
lobe of the soul, the believer appreciates God. Where there is no Bible doctrine,
there is no appreciation of God. Emotion is a response to something in the
thought pattern of the soul and is a result of what you think. When you think
Bible doctrine, you appreciate things on the basis of Bible doctrine. Psalms
26:2-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Examine me, O LORD, and try me; Test my mind and my
heart. For Your lovingkindness is before my eyes, And I have walked in Your
truth.&quot;  (Psalms 26:2-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Capacity for life gives confidence and boldness.
Therefore, when the believer functions daily under the grace apparatus for
perception, resulting in maximum doctrine in the right lobe of the soul, they
possesses emotional response and maximum capacity for responding to God’s love.
Psalms 139:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For You formed my inward parts; You wove me in my
mother's womb.&quot;  (Psalms 139:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When you have maximum doctrine in the soul, God possesses
your emotional responses and by possessing your emotional responses, He gives
you in grace the most fantastic capacity for life. When emotion is not in its
proper place, it has an effect on the physical body, like psychosomatic
illness. When you refuse doctrine, you create a vacuum in your soul that draws
in religion and emotionalism. You become more and more involved in these
emotions to the point where you make emotion your criterion for the spiritual
life. You then become one miserable person. See category on <a
href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/S/Spirituality.html">Spirituality</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some make emotion a false criterion of spirituality.
Everyone has emotions. Emotions are to enjoy things in life, such as people, a
beautiful scene, a concert, or a football game. However, emotion has no place
as a criterion or norm or standard for the Christian life. The criterion for
the Christian way of life is the Word of God. When you have Bible doctrine, you
can even appreciate the details of life because they become points of
doctrine. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Good and Bad Emotion</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Emotion is a responder to the content of the soul.
Emotion was never designed by God to replace the mentorship of God the Holy
Spirit as our teacher. Emotion is neither the criterion for the spiritual life
or the reality of the spiritual life. You are never spiritual because you are
emotional. Emotion never solves any problems of life. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer must distinguish between the normal function
of emotion as a good responder to the values of life and the sinful function of
emotion as a reaction to life. As a responder, emotion enhances appreciation
for what is noble and honorable in life. Emotional reaction produces sin, dead
works, evil, and emotional revolt of the soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Good and bad emotion are polar opposites. Good emotion is
a positive response to life’s situations while being filled with God the Holy
Spirit. Bad emotion is the negative reaction to life’s situations while out of
fellowship (carnal) and under the control of the old sin nature.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Good Emotion</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Good emotion is response to the filling of the Holy
Spirit in the spiritual life where the believer listens to, believes, and
applies Bible doctrine resident in the right lobe of their soul. Divine power
is used to deal with life’s problems and situations through thinking and
applying Bible doctrine. God’s solutions do not require emotion. Good emotion
responds to thinking and the values, norms, and standards of the conscience of
the soul. When you are out of fellowship, you abandon the values, norms, and standards
that you developed when you were in fellowship.  Good emotion responds to
thinking of the spiritual life including self-evaluation and the application of
Bible doctrine. Good emotion is a response to something in the thought pattern
of the soul, a result of what you think.</p>

<p class=Verses>“To sum up, all of you be harmonious, sympathetic, brotherly,
kindhearted, and humble in spirit;”  (1 Peter 3:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Good emotions means an appreciation of the finer things
or enjoyable things of life on the basis of who and what God is and His grace
provision. Doctrine is the criterion for emotions, but emotion is not the
criterion for the Christian life. You are not saved because you feel saved. You
are not spiritual because you feel spiritual! Phil. 4:8-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable,
whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of good
repute, if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise, dwell on
these things. The things you have learned and received and heard and seen in
me, practice these things, and the God of peace will be with you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Philippians
4:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The norm or standard for the Christian life is Bible
doctrine, never how you feel. Emotions have absolutely nothing to do with the
spiritual life or the intake and application of Bible doctrine. How you feel
does not determine whether or not you are saved nor whether or not you are
spiritual. Your spiritual status depends upon what the Bible says, therefore
good emotions are based on understanding doctrine taught and believing that
doctrine thus allowing the Holy Spirit to transfer it to the right lobe of the
soul. The believer can also have an emotional response when they see what God
can do in grace as they apply Bible doctrine to the situations in life. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Good emotion also comes from response to the laws of
divine establishment such as patriotism, virtue in government, virtue in
marriage, family values, and personal values. This is true for the believer as
well as the unbeliever. Personal virtues such as honor, integrity, and nobility
of character are sources of good emotion for the believer related to doctrine
and for the unbeliever related to the laws of divine establishment.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The biblical documentation for “joy” combines Bible doctrine
application with good emotional response. When you use Bible doctrine from the
right lobe of your soul to solve life’s problems, </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>you may weep in the night, but in the morning you will have
happiness. Neh. 8:10; Psalms 30:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then he said to them, “Go, eat of the fat, drink of the sweet,
and send portions to him who has nothing prepared; for this day is holy to our
Lord. Do not be grieved, for the joy of the LORD is your strength.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Nehemiah
8:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For His anger is but for a moment, His favor is for a
lifetime; Weeping may last for the night, But a shout of joy comes in the
morning.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 30:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Joy is the function of sharing the happiness of God at a
point of maximum doctrine in the soul, so that the emotions have something good
to appreciate. The Greek verb <span lang=EL>χαι</span>́<span lang=EL>ρω</span><span
lang=EL> </span>(chairo) means to rejoice and is thinking God’s happiness in
contrast to emotion often confused as human happiness. The Greek noun <span
lang=EL>χαρα</span>́ (chara) is translated “joy” and is the quintessence of
combining the mechanics of the spiritual life with a system of thinking, which
elicits the response of good emotion. Col. 1:10-11; 1 Thess. 1:6; Phil. 4:4;
Phil. 1:23-25.</p>

<p class=Verses>“so that you will walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, to
please Him in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in
the knowledge of God; strengthened with all power, according to His glorious
might, for the attaining of all steadfastness and patience; joyously”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Colossians
1:10-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“You also became imitators of us and of the Lord, having
received the word in much tribulation with the joy of the Holy Spirit,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Thessalonians 1:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice!”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Philippians
4:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But I am hard-pressed from both directions, having the desire
to depart and be with Christ, for that is very much better; yet to remain on in
the flesh is more necessary for your sake. Convinced of this, I know that I
will remain and continue with you all for your progress and joy in the faith,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Philippians
1:23-25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Joy is perfect happiness which produces good emotion as
an appreciator of that happiness. We are to be imitators of the Lord. We are not
to imitate personality characteristics. When you get into role model arrogance,
you have bad emotion. Circumstances are not the issue in sharing the perfect
happiness of God. Maximum doctrine circulating in the stream of consciousness
elicits the ultimate in good emotion from a developed capacity for the
spiritual life. Psalms 16:5-7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The LORD is the portion of my inheritance and my cup; You
support my lot. The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places; Indeed, my
heritage is beautiful to me. I will bless the LORD who has counseled me;
Indeed, my mind instructs me in the night.&quot;  (Psalms 16:5-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are to we have an appreciation of God and to be
controlled by our renovated thinking. Not to be dominated by our emotions. Good
emotions are not the criteria for the spiritual life.  When emotion is made the
criterion, we get into false doctrine which appeals to the emotions. When you
take emotion from being the appreciator of things in life and try to make it a
norm or standard for the Christian way of life, you are in trouble and could
become a trouble maker. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A carnal believer cannot have a legitimate emotion
related to the spiritual life. When you are out of fellowship, your emotion is
not the issue. The issue is naming your sins to God the Father and being
restored to fellowship with God. The spiritual life runs on the divine power of
the Holy Spirit, never on how you feel. Even good emotion will not get you back
into fellowship.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Bad Emotion</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Bad emotion is defined as reaction emotion, which makes
how you feel the criterion for the spiritual life instead of Bible doctrine
perceived, believed, and circulating in your soul. Bad emotion is emotion out
of control in a state of reaction toward the teaching of the Word.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Bad emotion is divorced from reality so that the believer
sees the problem but never sees the solution. Bad emotion is pseudo compassion,
pseudo love, crusader arrogance, Christian activism, and similar things. Bad
emotion is the allegation that emotional activity such as remorse or regret
have something to do with being saved or being forgiven for sin.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Bad emotion is often pathological arrogance. Bad emotion
is the function of evil obsession, unrealistic expectation, role model
arrogance, the feet of clay syndrome, iconoclastic arrogance followed by evil
obsession related to legalism, power lust, and allegations of sinless
perfection.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The emotional complex of sins is bad emotion and has a
number of categories – hysteria, hatred, irrationality, guilt, repression, and
hybrid guilt. The hysteria category includes fear, worry, anxiety, consternation,
and panic. The revenge category includes malice, the lust to inflict injury or
suffering on others, revenge motivation, violence, murder, gossip, slander,
maligning, judging, and vilification of others. The hatred category includes
anger, hatred, bitterness, jealousy, loathing, animosity, and implacability.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The irrational category includes tantrums, vulnerability
to imagined insults or snubs, self-pity, whining, sniveling, denial,
projection, and neurosis. The guilt category includes remorse for real or
imagined sins, morbid self-reproach, emotional feelings of culpability,
self-righteous arrogance, arrogant preoccupation with one’s feelings and
impulses, guilt resulting from the manipulation of legalism, and arrogant
preoccupation with the correctness of one’s behavior.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The repression category is defined as the denial of the
reality of the problem because it is too painful or too unpleasant to face.
Repression avoids facing the issue. A part of this is denial, which results in
the projection or transfer of one’s flaws, sins, or failures to someone else.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The hybrid guilt category is one of the most dangerous
categories. In this category, feelings of guilt which cause perpetual anxiety
may be alleviated by a contrived defense mechanism of blaming others for your
own sins. You find someone else and assign them the problem. Therefore, you
avoid the reality of the law of volitional responsibility. The only one to whom
we are responsible when we sin is God the Father.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As a part of the laws of volitional responsibility and
cultural concepts developed from it, apologies are often made to people. But
this is not a part of the spiritual life because this can be done by the
unbeliever and anything the unbeliever can do is not part of the spiritual
life.  Apologizing to others and getting their forgiveness is not confession of
sin and not a part of the spiritual life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mental attitude sins from the old sin nature hinder
capacity for love and life destroy the function of the right lobe of the soul.
Prov. 23:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;My son, if your heart is wise, My own heart also will be
glad;&quot;  (Proverbs 23:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Bad emotions are described in 2 Corinthians 6:11-12 and
Romans 16:17-18. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Our mouth has spoken freely to you, O Corinthians, our heart
is opened wide (I, Paul am giving you Bible doctrine from a full human spirit).
You are not restrained by us, but you are restrained (limited) in your own
affections (emotions).”  (2 Corinthians 6:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now I urge you, brethren, keep your eye on those who cause
dissensions and hindrances contrary to the teaching which you learned, and turn
away from them. For such men are slaves, not of our Lord Christ but of their
own appetites; and by their smooth and flattering speech they deceive the
hearts of the unsuspecting.”  (Romans 16:17-18, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Biblical Words for Emotion</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Human anatomy in the languages of the ancient world often
doubled for functions of the soul because they did not have a psychological
vocabulary or a vocabulary for the soul. Some of the words used for emotions in
the Bible are listed below. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Appetite or Stomach.</u> Prov. 13:25; Prov. 26:22; Rom.
16:17-18; Phil. 3:19</p>

<p class=Verses>“The righteous has enough to satisfy his appetite, But the
stomach of the wicked is in need.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 13:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The words of a whisperer are like dainty morsels, And they go
down into the innermost parts of the body.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 26:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now I urge you, brethren, keep your eye on those who cause
dissensions and hindrances contrary to the teaching which you learned, and turn
away from them. For such men are slaves, not of our Lord Christ but of their
own appetites; and by their smooth and flattering speech they deceive the
hearts of the unsuspecting.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 16:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“whose end is destruction, whose god is their appetite, and
whose glory is in their shame, who set their minds on earthly things.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Philippians
3:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Deeply Stirred</u>. Gen. 43:30; 1 Kings 3:26.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Joseph hurried out for he was deeply stirred over his brother,
and he sought a place to weep; and he entered his chamber and wept there.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis
43:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the woman whose child was the living one spoke to the
king, for she was deeply stirred over her son and said, “Oh, my lord, give her
the living child, and by no means kill him.” But the other said, “He shall be
neither mine nor yours; divide him!”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Kings 3:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Affection</u>. Phil. 1:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For God is my witness, how I long for you all with the
affection of Christ Jesus.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Philippians 1:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Heart</u>. The word “heart” is not used in the Bible
for the human organ that pumps blood through the body’s cardiovascular system.
It is used generally for the right lobe of the soul where <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine is stored and is the staging area for application to the
spiritual life. The heart has no emotional connotation by itself. However, the
doctrinal content in the heart or right lobe of the soul can be appreciated
emotionally. Jer. 4:19; Jer. 31:20; Lam. 1:20; Lam. 2:11; Philemon 1:12;
Philemon 1:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“My soul, my soul! I am in anguish! Oh, my heart! My heart is
pounding in me; I cannot be silent, Because you have heard, O my soul, The
sound of the trumpet, The alarm of war.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jeremiah 4:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““Is Ephraim My dear son? Is he a delightful child? Indeed, as
often as I have spoken against him, I certainly still remember him; Therefore
My heart yearns for him; I will surely have mercy on him,” declares the LORD.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jeremiah
31:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““See, O LORD, for I am in distress; My spirit is greatly
troubled; My heart is overturned within me, For I have been very rebellious. In
the street the sword slays; In the house it is like death.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Lamentations
1:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“My eyes fail because of tears, My spirit is greatly troubled;
My heart is poured out on the earth Because of the destruction of the daughter
of my people, When little ones and infants faint In the streets of the city.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Lamentations
2:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“I have sent him back to you in person, that is, sending my
very heart,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Philemon 1:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Yes, brother, let me benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my
heart in Christ.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Philemon 1:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Mind</u>. The use of the word “mind” in the Bible
refers to the left lobe of the soul. This is the location of all non-spiritual
knowledge that we learn. For the believer, this is where spiritually understood
Bible doctrine (<i>gnosis</i> – knowledge) is transferred from the human spirit
by God the Holy Spirit. <i>Gnosis</i> is Bible doctrine not yet believed and is
not applicable to the spiritual life. The believer must exercise faith belief
in that doctrine whereby the Holy Spirit transfers it to the right lobe of the
soul (the heart) as <i>epignosis</i> or full knowledge. Psalms 7:9; Psalms 26:2;
Jer. 12:2; Jer. 17:10; Jer. 20:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“O let the evil of the wicked come to an end, but establish the
righteous; For the righteous God tries the hearts and minds.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms
7:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Examine me, O LORD, and try me; Test my mind and my heart.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms
26:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“You have planted them, they have also taken root; They grow,
they have even produced fruit. You are near to their lips But far from their
mind.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jeremiah 12:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““I, the LORD, search the heart, I test the mind, Even to give
to each man according to his ways, According to the results of his deeds.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jeremiah
17:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Yet, O LORD of hosts, You who test the righteous, Who see the
mind and the heart; Let me see Your vengeance on them; For to You I have set
forth my cause.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jeremiah 20:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Inward Parts</u>. When the believer has maximum
doctrine in the right lobe of the soul, they possess an emotional response with
maximum capacity for responding to God’s love. As a result, God possesses your
emotional responses and gives you in grace the most fantastic capacity for
life. Psalms 139:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For You formed my inward parts; You wove me in my mother’s
womb.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 139:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Inmost being</u>. Prov. 23:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And my inmost being will rejoice When your lips speak what is
right.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 23:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God’s Testing of Our Emotions</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Emotions are tested by God. The doctrinal content of the
right lobe determines both appreciation and capacity for God’s grace. A mature
believer’s capacity for life gives confidence and boldness. Psalms 7:9; Psalms 26:2;
Jer. 11:20; Jer. 17:10; Jer. 20:12; Rev. 2:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“O let the evil of the wicked come to an end, but establish the
righteous; For the righteous God tries the hearts and minds.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms
7:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Examine me, O LORD, and try me; Test my mind and my heart.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms
26:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But, O LORD of hosts, who judges righteously, Who tries the
feelings and the heart, Let me see Your vengeance on them, For to You have I
committed my cause.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jeremiah 11:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““I, the LORD, search the heart, I test the mind, Even to give
to each man according to his ways, According to the results of his deeds.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jeremiah
17:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Yet, O LORD of hosts, You who test the righteous, Who see the
mind and the heart; Let me see Your vengeance on them; For to You I have set
forth my cause.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jeremiah 20:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In every one of these verses, we have anthropopathisms (attributing
human functions or attributes to deity). God does not test your emotional responses
to the Bible doctrine in your soul at some specific time, but His omniscience
knew billions of years ago in eternity past the status and content of your soul’s
right lobe at any given time. God doesn’t have to test you to know what is
going on!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You cannot hide anything from God. He read your thoughts
billions of years ago in eternity past. You will never be able to hide anything
from God. You can’t fool God! The condition of your soul was known at all times
– now and before time began in eternity past. Therefore, testing here means God
analyzes your capacity for life in order to challenge you to gain more capacity
for life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Since capacity for life is based on the amount of Bible
doctrine in the right lobe of your soul, testing you has to do with whether you
will respond to the test with application of <i>epignosis</i> doctrine in the
power of the Holy Spirit or whether you will react emotionally and rely on your
own capabilities. You may have a good or bad emotional response from that test.
God tests you to your inner most being. God tests how you react, how you
respond, and how you think under pressure. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Your soul’s frame of reference elicits a bonafide
response in your thinking and in your emotions. Jeremiah’s response to his
testing was his use of Bible doctrine in his soul. He also had an emotional
response - double blessing, double appreciation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Emotions Can Be Destroyed </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The emotions can be destroyed by the old sin nature bombarding
them with mental attitude sins. The emotions were never designed to respond to mental
attitude sins. This motivates the emotions to revolt against the right lobe of
the soul, so you have revolution in the soul. Job 16:13; Psalms 73:21; Lam.
3:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>““His arrows surround me. Without mercy He splits my kidneys
open; He pours out my gall on the ground.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Job 16:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“When my heart was embittered And I was pierced within,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms
73:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He made the arrows of His quiver To enter into my inward
parts.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Lamentations 3:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The result is instability, wide emotional swings,
revolution, and chaos. Chaos is temporary or permanent psychosis. Emotional
revolt explains apostasy and why a believer can go apostate. It can also
explain why the carnal believer can get into sublimation, has lack of capacity
for life, lack of capacity for love, and degeneracy. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Emotion Reacts to Tragedy</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In tragedy or catastrophe, your emotions must respond to
Bible doctrine in the right lobe of your soul while in fellowship for any
tranquility of soul. When emotions react so that they rebel against Bible
doctrine in the right lobe, anguish of soul occurs.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Jeremiah 4:19-20, Jeremiah’s emotions were in control and
his soul was in pain regarding the fifth cycle of discipline destruction of
Judah from God’s divine discipline on the nation. His soul was in anguish and
his heart was pounding in his chest. He had genuine pain. “I cannot be silent” means
he had no tranquility of soul on the happiness spectrum. “O my soul” was his
reaction to the fifth cycle of discipline. Lam. 1:20</p>

<p class=Verses>“My soul, my soul! I am in anguish! Oh, my heart! My heart is
pounding in me; I cannot be silent, Because you have heard, O my soul, The
sound of the trumpet, The alarm of war. Disaster on disaster is proclaimed, For
the whole land is devastated; Suddenly my tents are devastated, My curtains in
an instant.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jeremiah 4:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““See, O LORD, for I am in distress; My spirit is greatly
troubled; My heart is overturned within me, For I have been very rebellious. In
the street the sword slays; In the house it is like death.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Lamentations
1:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The heart responds to the emotions which are in control. When
emotion dominates, the heart is troubled and in grievous rebellion. The
emotions are reacting with tears and misery. Lam. 2:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“My eyes fail because of tears, My spirit is greatly troubled;
My heart is poured out on the earth Because of the destruction of the daughter
of my people, When little ones and infants faint In the streets of the city.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Lamentations
2:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Emotion is the Appreciator of the Soul</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Emotion is an appreciator of love, but emotion as a
leader destroys capacity for life. Joseph had always loved his brother in his
heart, but it was not until Benjamin came on the scene that he was reminded how
much he loved his younger brother. Sometimes you are not aware of the love in
your soul until something triggers it and elicits a response in the emotion.
Gen. 43:30.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Joseph hurried out for he was deeply stirred over his brother,
and he sought a place to weep; and he entered his chamber and wept there.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis
43:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Emotional response makes one very aware of the existence
of love in their soul. Of course, your emotions are not designed to respond all
day. If they did, they would be destroyed. You have things to do. But you still
have love for someone in your soul all the time. When triggered, the emotions
respond and make you aware of that love. However, emotions do not contain love.
Remember that the emotions have no doctrinal content. The emotions are simply
responders. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the king said, “The one says, ‘This is my son who is
living, and your son is the dead one’; and the other says, ‘No! For your son is
the dead one, and my son is the living one.’“ The king said, “Get me a sword.”
So they brought a sword before the king. The king said, “Divide the living
child in two, and give half to the one and half to the other.” Then the woman
whose child was the living one spoke to the king, for she was deeply stirred
over her son and said, “Oh, my lord, give her the living child, and by no means
kill him.” But the other said, “He shall be neither mine nor yours; divide him!”
Then the king said, “Give the first woman the living child, and by no means
kill him. She is his mother.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Kings 3:23-27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Kings 3:23-27, the same emotional response to soul
love is shown as in Genesis 43:30 and involves Solomon and two mothers. Both
women claimed the child, but only one woman could be the real mother. When
Solomon stated his intention to cut the child in two to evenly divide the child
between both women, the real mother asked that the baby be spared and given to
the other woman. Based on this, Solomon had allowed the real mother’s love to
be confirmed. Other examples can be found in Philippians 1:8 and 1 John 3:16-17. 
</p>

<p class=Verses>“For God is my witness, how I long for you all with the
affection of Christ Jesus.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Philippians 1:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“We know love by this, that He laid down His life for us; and
we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. But whoever has the world’s
goods, and sees his brother in need and closes his heart against him, how does
the love of God abide in him?”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 John 3:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 23:15-17, there is an illustration of the
relationship between thinking and normal emotion. Emotion is related to unconditional
mental attitude love as stimulating capacity in this area. David is teaching his
son Solomon.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“My son, if your heart is wise, My own heart also will be glad;
And my inmost being will rejoice When your lips speak what is right. Do not let
your heart envy sinners, But live in the fear of the LORD always.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs
23:15-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The communion table is designed to remember and
appreciate our Lord Jesus Christ and His work on the Cross. If you love Him,
your emotions respond in memory to all He is and all He has done for you. The
pertinent doctrines are in your right lobe. The cup and the bread give your
emotion an opportunity to respond to the One unseen whom you love, and yet
still maintain poise and stability in assembled worship.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ritual keeps emotions from getting out of hand. It
provides control and order in assembly. The Scots do the same in their singing
of Auld Lang Syne and toasting the cup. So as believer-priests assembled
together for communion, this is a very tender moment for all of us.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Emotion Stimulates Happiness</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Emotion stimulates happiness. Happiness is in the right
lobe of the soul. The emotions respond and you becomes aware of what is in your
right lobe. The frame of reference in the right lobe provides information for
the memory center which stimulates response in the emotions.  Therefore, the
emotions become a stimulus to happiness. They are not happiness, but they make
you aware that you are happy. Prov. 23:15-16; Philemon 1:7; Philemon 1:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“My son, if your heart is wise, My own heart also will be glad;
And my inmost being will rejoice When your lips speak what is right.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs
23:15-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For I have come to have much joy and comfort in your love,
because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Philemon
1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Yes, brother, let me benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my
heart in Christ.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Philemon 1:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Your conscience contains your norms and standards. The
conscience turns on the emotions stimulating the function of the priesthood. Your
priesthood is stimulated to function when your emotion is stimulated by your
norms and standards. Emotional response to your conscience causes you to have
esprit de corps. Esprit de corps is emotional response or stimulation to your
norms and standards. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The viewpoint in the right lobe provides stimulus or
response from the emotions, as when you hear someone else speak divine
viewpoint. You should stimulated when you hear something on TV that represents
divine viewpoint. This stimulates response to your own viewpoint from Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Emotions and Spirituality in the Church Age</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Christ is absent from the earth during the Church Age,
therefore the filling of the Holy Spirit produces the character and glory of
Christ without emotion being an integral part of spirituality. Gal. 5:22-23;
Gal. 4:19; Rom. 5:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience,
kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things
there is no law.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Galatians 5:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“My children, with whom I am again in labor until Christ is
formed in you—”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Galatians 4:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been
poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
5:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Emotion is never designed to produce character, but to
respond to character. That’s why emotion cannot be a part of spirituality.
Appreciation of Jesus Christ comes through perception of doctrine rather than
emotional function. This does not eliminate emotion, but puts emotion in its
proper place.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Emotional function cannot produce integrity. It cannot
apply doctrine. Emotion is not a part of the filling of the Holy Spirit. In the
Church Age, emotion is a responder to many things in the right lobe, including
doctrine, the laws of divine establishment, love, and patriotism, but emotional
response is never the filling of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Just as grace glues the essence of God together, so
emotion as a responder is distilled grace.  Emotion as an aggressor is concentrated
legalism. You can be depressed for physiological reasons and still be filled
with the Spirit. How you feel has nothing to do with your spiritual status. Emotion
and ecstatics have no spiritual content in the dispensation of the Church Age. 
Therefore, how you feel is never the measure of your spiritual life. Emotional
activity or ecstatics never indicates the level of spiritual activity or spiritual
advance.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Emotion is designed to respond to doctrine in the right
lobe, but is not characteristic of the filling of the Holy Spirit. Ecstatics
belongs to the human race. The filling of the Spirit belongs to the believer.
The emotions can respond or react to the filling of the Spirit, but emotions
cannot be the filling of the Holy Spirit. The purpose of the filling of the
Holy Spirit is perception of Bible doctrine, advance to spiritual maturity, and
production from your ambassadorship, but never the manufacture of ecstatics.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Spirituality and Emotions in The Millennium</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>During the Millennium, Jesus Christ will be physically
present on earth and will have changed the earth to be a perfect environment.
The Angelic Conflict will be suspended with Satan and his demons removed from
the earth. Only in the Millennium when Christ is present on the earth and
ruling the world do emotions or ecstatics characterize the filling of the Holy
Spirit. While there is no spiritual content to emotion in the Church Age, there
will definitely be spiritual content to emotion in the Millennium.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Millennium, the filling of the Holy Spirit will be
designed to appreciate the reigning Christ rather than to produce the character
of Christ. Therefore, ecstatics will then be a legitimate spiritual emotion. Believers
in the Millennium will be universally indwelt with the Holy Spirit as in the
Church Age. Ezekiel 36:27; Ezekiel 37:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>““I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My
statutes, and you will be careful to observe My ordinances.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ezekiel
36:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““I will put My Spirit within you and you will come to life,
and I will place you on your own land. Then you will know that I, the LORD,
have spoken and done it,” declares the LORD.’““&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ezekiel 37:14,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers in the Millennium are also commanded to be
filled with the Holy Spirit. Isaiah 29:19; Isaiah 32:15; Isaiah 44:3; Ezekiel
39:29; Zech. 12:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The afflicted also will increase their gladness in the LORD,
And the needy of mankind will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah
29:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Until the Spirit is poured out upon us from on high, And the
wilderness becomes a fertile field, And the fertile field is considered as a
forest.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah 32:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“‘For I will pour out water on the thirsty land And streams on
the dry ground; I will pour out My Spirit on your offspring And My blessing on
your descendants;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah 44:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““I will not hide My face from them any longer, for I will have
poured out My Spirit on the house of Israel,” declares the Lord GOD.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ezekiel
39:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants
of Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and of supplication, so that they will look
on Me whom they have pierced; and they will mourn for Him, as one mourns for an
only son, and they will weep bitterly over Him like the bitter weeping over a
firstborn.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Zechariah 12:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The filling of the Holy Spirit in the Millennium will be
characterized by ecstatics and emotional appreciation. Emotion will still be an
appreciator, not a character builder. Joel 2:28-29.</p>

<p class=Verses>““It will come about after this That I will pour out My Spirit
on all mankind; And your sons and daughters will prophesy, Your old men will
dream dreams, Your young men will see visions. “Even on the male and female
servants I will pour out My Spirit in those days.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Joel 2:28-29,
NASB)</p>
