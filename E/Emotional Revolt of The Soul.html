<h2><a name="_Emotional_Revolt_of"></a><a name="_D-Emotional_Revolt_of"></a>Emotional
Revolt of The Soul</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The emotional revolt of the soul backed by the old sin
nature causes emotion to become the aggressor rather than the responder. This
causes emotion to become the criterion rather than the <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrinal
content of the right lobe. Therefore, the emotional revolution against the
establishment of the soul causes the malfunction or total failure of the grace
apparatus for perception. The failure of the grace apparatus for perception
makes the Christian life and God’s plan impossible to fulfill. The divine
viewpoint thinking in the right lobe of the soul must control the emotional
pattern for spiritual advance to occur.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Instead of responding to Bible doctrine in the right
lobe, the emotion responds to mental attitude sins, approbation, power lust,
and human good. Then the emotion reacts and revolts against the right lobe and
cuts off any doctrine in the right lobe. Instead of responding to doctrine in
the soul, emotion revolts and takes command of the soul. With the emotion in
command, all capacity, love, and happiness is gone.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Once emotion revolts against the heart and becomes the
aggressor, it loses all capacity for life, is replaced with frustration, and
comes under the influence of the old sin nature. This is called grieving the
Holy Spirit. People in emotional revolt are very frustrated. There is negative
volition to doctrine plus recession of thought replaced by the frantic search
for happiness and total dependence on feeling rather than on common sense. 
People often substitute chemical stimulation for thought.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Emotion can be a hindrance to the plan of God and a
distraction to the perception of doctrine. 2 Cor. 6:11-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Our mouth has spoken freely to you, O Corinthians, our heart
is opened wide. You are not restrained by us, but you are restrained in your
own affections.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Corinthians 6:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>Having lost the ability to
respond to the <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the right lobe, the emotion
becomes inflexible regarding the non‑essentials. Emotional revolt is found in
Revelation 2:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“‘And I will kill her children with pestilence, and all the
churches will know that I am He who searches the minds and hearts; and I will
give to each one of you according to your deeds.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation 2:23,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Therefore, the command to separate from those in
emotional revolt is given. They serve their emotions and there is nothing in
the emotion. How do you deceive the heart? The old sin nature inspires the
emotion to revolt against the right lobe of the soul. Rom. 16:17‑18.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“Now I urge you, brethren, keep your eye on those who cause
dissensions and hindrances contrary to the teaching which you learned, and turn
away from them. For such men are slaves, not of our Lord Christ but of their
own appetites; and by their smooth and flattering speech they deceive the
hearts of the unsuspecting.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 16:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers who live by their emotions are believers whose
emotional revolt has produced chaos in their souls. The emotion is no longer a
responder, but an aggressor. Believers with such chaos of the soul are
troublemakers, therefore other believers are commanded to separate from them. An
example of this would be separation from those involved in the Tongues movement
because their false beliefs and activities are an emotional revolt against the
divine establishment of the soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Emotional Revolt Can Lead to Mental Health Problems </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Lord Jesus Christ blotted out all our sins at
salvation and the filling of the Holy Spirit plus the intake and application of
Bible doctrine will renovate or renew the believer’s thinking. The way of
thinking without <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the soul includes the
mental attitude sins of self-pity, jealousy, a guilt complex for past sins or
failures, subjectively rationalizing everything you think and do to be okay,
feeling one must be emotional to be spiritual, and giving in to the lust
patterns and areas of weakness in the old sin nature. Psalms 103:2-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Bless the LORD, O my soul, And forget none of His benefits;
Who pardons all your iniquities, Who heals all your diseases; Who redeems your
life from the pit, Who crowns you with lovingkindness and compassion;” (Psalms
103:2-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The healing of these soul problems or trends comes from
the consistent intake and application of Bible doctrine. Many people try other
means to counter the effects of emotional revolt such as using drugs or alcohol
to temporarily mask their problems or feelings. Some feel that having an affair
(if married) will solve their problems. Those still single may try numerous
sexual encounters to help them forget their problems. Some try self-help or
psychological counselling to try to solve their problems. Some get so far into
emotional revolt that they try or succeed in suicide to escape their problems. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Without confession of sin to God the Father and their
return to the filling of the Holy Spirit, they cannot correct the trends and
areas of weakness of the old sin nature that controls their soul. Such
believers still have the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, but have quenched and
grieved the Holy Spirit for so long that scar tissue or soul callousness has
developed. Eph. 4:18-19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“being darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life
of God because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of
their heart; and they, having become callous, have given themselves over to
sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness.”
(Ephesians 4:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Only the filling of the Holy Spirit and the consistent
intake and application of Bible doctrine can correct or renovate the soul
damage done or scar tissue caused by emotional revolt. <i>Epignosis</i> Bible
doctrine in the soul will move the emotions back to being a responder rather
than the initiator of the soul and return objective divine viewpoint thinking
back as the initiator. This is renovation of the soul. Eph. 4:23-24.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind, and put on
the new self, which in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness
and holiness of the truth.” (Ephesians 4:23-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><a name="_Encouragement"></a><b>Emotional Revolt of The
Exodus Generation </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Exodus generation was liberated from slavery by the
grace of God in 1441 BC. That generation failed to reach the Land of Promise
because of scar tissue and the emotional revolt of the soul. While the bodies
of the Jews were liberated from slavery, their souls remained in the slavery of
Egypt. Num. 11:5; Num. 20:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;We remember the fish which we used to eat free in Egypt,
the cucumbers and the melons and the leeks and the onions and the garlic,”
(Numbers 11:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Why have you made us come up from Egypt, to bring us in
to this wretched place? It is not a place of grain or figs or vines or
pomegranates, nor is there water to drink.&quot;” (Numbers 20:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This soul slavery was caused by negative volition toward Bible
doctrine. Even though they had the best doctrinal teacher of all time, Moses,
they still were negative. Therefore, when reaching Mt. Sinai the Jews were not
ready for the Mosaic Law as illustrated by the Golden Calf incident in Exodus
32. Which did God provide first? The Mosaic Law or the Promised Land? He
provided first the Law. There was no sense going into the Land unless they
first know how to use their freedom.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The born-again Jews of the Exodus generation had
prolonged negative volition toward Bible doctrine that produced scar tissue in
their souls and caused a vacuum to be created that pulled in Satanic doctrine. Add
to this the emotional revolt of the soul and this is the status of the Exodus
generation. Their souls were in slavery while their bodies were free. A horrible
condition!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God in grace could free their bodies because the body
does not have volition. But God could not free their souls, because before He
can do that the volition in that soul must be positive! Positive volition frees
the soul! For 40 years the Jews remained in soul-slavery after their liberation
from Egypt. That generation never entered the Land due to their continued
negative volition toward God and His grace teaching and grace provision. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>However, their children were positive to God and to His
grace provision and the Word of God taught by Moses. Only the second generation
would enter the Land of Promise. During that 40 years, Moses, one of the three
greatest communicators who ever lived taught them the Mosaic Law. The Mosaic
law was designed to free the souls of the Jews compatible with the status of
their freed bodies.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Emotional Revolt of Israel in Jeramiah’s Day</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The 40 years of the Exodus generation from 1441 BC to
1401 BC is parallel to the 40 years of Jeremiah’s ministry to the Jews from 626
BC to 586 BC. Both Moses and Jeremiah were great preachers. In Jeremiah’s day,
the Jews were free in body, but enslaved of soul. The Jews refused the freedom
of the Mosaic Law in Jeremiah 11:5-7. </p>

<p class=Verses>“in order to confirm the oath which I swore to your
forefathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this
day.&quot;'&quot; Then I said, &quot;Amen, O LORD.&quot; And the LORD said to
me, &quot;Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of
Jerusalem, saying, 'Hear the words of this covenant and do them. 'For I
solemnly warned your fathers in the day that I brought them up from the land of
Egypt, even to this day, warning persistently, saying, &quot;Listen to My
voice.&quot;” (Jeremiah 11:5-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God offered them the blueprint of soul freedom and they
turned it down flat! The Mosaic Law was not promoting morality as its primary
purpose. It contained the basic principles of human freedom. The Mosaic Law was
not designed to define sin, but to promote and preserve human freedom.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The overt manifestation of soul slavery was the same in
both generations. Idolatry. In Exodus it was the golden calf. In Jeremiah’s day
it was Phallic Cult or Baal worship. For 40 years grace did not cease as
Jeremiah like Moses taught Bible doctrine. They certainly did not earn or
deserve His grace. None of us ever deserve God's grace provision and blessing. These
were the two most undeserving generations in all history. Both generations were
Jews.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Jews of Jeremiah’s day rejected Bible doctrine and
the nation returned to physical slavery from which the Lord had taken them. The
Jews of Moses’ day were freed physically, but rejected Bible doctrine and
remained in soul slavery and ultimately died the sin unto death in the desert. 
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Remember that the Jews of the Old Testament did not have
the indwelling or filling of the Holy Spirit when they were saved. But the Jews
of the Old Testament did have the Mosaic Law as a basis for their freedom. The
Mosaic Law is not the basis of spiritual freedom for the Church Age, the Holy
Spirit is now that basis. Gal. 5:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“It was for freedom that Christ set us free; therefore keep
standing firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery.” (Galatians
5:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>How did the Mosaic Law become a yoke of bondage? Through
legalism. The Mosaic Law was given by grace. It was meant for freedom not
bondage! They were set free by faith in Christ and lived in freedom through the
Mosaic Law. By way of contrast, believer-priests of the Church Age are likewise
set free by faith in Christ, however the indwelling Holy Spirit is the basis
for living in spiritual freedom. Gal. 3:2-3; Gal. 3:5-6; Rom. 8:2-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“This is the only thing I want to find out from you: did you
receive the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by hearing with faith? Are you
so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the
flesh?” (Galatians 3:2-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So then, does He who provides you with the Spirit and works
miracles among you, do it by the works of the Law, or by hearing with faith?
Even so Abraham BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS RECKONED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS.”
(Galatians 3:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you
free from the law of sin and of death. For what the Law could not do, weak as
it was through the flesh, God did: sending His own Son in the likeness of
sinful flesh and as an offering for sin, He condemned sin in the flesh, so that
the requirement of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according
to the flesh but according to the Spirit.” (Romans 8:2-4, NASB)</p>
