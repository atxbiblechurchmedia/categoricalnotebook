<h2>Expiation</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Expiation is the act of making satisfaction for an
offense by which the guilt is done away with and the necessity of punishment is
cancelled. In Adam we are all counted guilty. Imputed sin is seen by God as relative
righteousness. We are spiritually dead. The penalty for this relative
righteousness of imputed sin is spiritual death, which cannot have fellowship
with God. Since relative righteousness comes between man and God and God's absolute
righteousness cannot have fellowship with relative righteousness, the human
race owes God an absolute righteousness which they do not have and cannot ever
generate. Isaiah 59:2; 1 Cor. 15:22; Rom. 3:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But your iniquities have made a separation between you and
your God, And your sins have hidden His face from you so that He does not
hear.” (Isaiah 59:2, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made
alive.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 15:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
3:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Barrier: Penalty of Sin</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The absolute righteousness of God cannot have contact or
association with sin. Moreover, absolute righteousness cannot have fellowship
with the best works that man can offer which amount to relative righteousness,
which cannot ever measure up to God’s absolute righteousness. Rom. 3:23; Isaiah
59:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
3:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But your iniquities have made a separation between you and
your God, And your sins have hidden His face from you so that He does not hear.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah
59:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is perfect justice, which demands that disobedience
against His laws be punished. John 3:36. </p>

<p class=Verses>““He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who does
not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(John
3:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Justice placed a penalty on sin of spiritual death. Rom.
6:23. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is
eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 6:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Since absolute righteousness cannot have fellowship with relative
righteousness, we must have God’s perfect righteousness in order to fellowship
with Him. But we can’t supply it no matter how much we desire a relationship
with God. The only solution is expiation based on the work of Jesus Christ on
the Cross.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Work of Christ: Expiation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Lord Jesus Christ took every “IOU” of the human race
and carried them to the Cross and placed them on Himself. Col. 2:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“having canceled out the certificate of debt consisting of
decrees against us, which was hostile to us; and He has taken it out of the
way, having nailed it to the cross.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Colossians 2:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ was judged for our sins, which resulted in
His spiritual death on the Cross. His spiritual death satisfied the justice of
God so in Christ we are counted not guilty. We are seen by God as absolute
righteousness and as spiritually alive, so the guilt is done away with and the
necessity of punishment is cancelled, because God's very own absolute
righteousness has been imputed to every believer at salvation. 2 Cor. 5:18-21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now all these things are from God, who reconciled us to
Himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation, namely, that
God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not counting their
trespasses against them, and He has committed to us the word of reconciliation.
Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were making an appeal
through us; we beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. He made Him
who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that we might become the
righteousness of God in Him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Corinthians 5:18-21, NASB)</p>
