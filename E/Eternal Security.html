<h2><a name="_Eternal_Security"></a>Eternal Security</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Eternal security is defined as an unbreakable
relationship with the integrity of God and depends on the integrity of God. It
is an unbreakable relationship because God will not break the relationship
regardless of what we do or fail to do. Neither God nor man nor angel can
cancel or destroy this unbreakable relationship with God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The instant you believed in the substitutionary spiritual
death of Jesus Christ for all of your sins, the Holy Spirit entered you into
union with the Lord Jesus Christ. This is called the Baptism of the Holy
Spirit. It is a permanent position in Christ and there can be no condemnation
for any believer placed into union with Jesus Christ. This means that you have
a standing before God which is exactly the same as the Lord Jesus Christ. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In our relationship with Jesus Christ, we share
everything the Lord Jesus has at the right hand of God the Father. We share His
absolute righteousness, His eternal life, His priesthood, His election, His
destiny, and His heirship. No one is able to change that relationship – not
you, not even God. This happens at the moment of salvation or the moment we
accept Christ as our Savior. Salvation is the first phase of God’s plan for our
life. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 10:28-30, the “hand of God” is an
anthropomorphism that illustrates eternal security. An anthropomorphism assigns
a human characteristic or a part of the human body to God which God does not
have. It is used to explain God’s policy to the human race in terms we can
easily understand. We as believers are the possession of Jesus Christ and He
will not let any one of us be removed from His hand.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; and I give eternal life to them, and they will never
perish; and no one will snatch them out of My hand. &quot;My Father, who has
given them to Me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of
the Father's hand. &quot;I and the Father are one.&quot; &quot;  (John
10:28-30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In John 10:28-30, “never” is a double negative in the
Greek and means never, no not ever. Now, that is eternal security. Remember, a
double negative in the Greek is different than in the English and provides much
more emphasis on the negative when used. This passage goes on to say that no
one is able to take them out of the hands of either Jesus Christ or the Father.
This means that both the Father and the Son hold us in their hands. This is a
sure-fire and eternal grip. Psalms 37:23-24. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The steps of a man are established by the LORD, And He
delights in his way. When he falls, he will not be hurled headlong, Because the
LORD is the One who holds his hand.&quot;  (Psalms 37:23-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Acts 16:31 says that all who believe in the Lord Jesus
Christ will be saved as well as anyone else in their household who also
believes. This does not mean your children will automatically be saved because
you accepted Christ as Savior, but that you will be saved by believing in
Christ and your children will be saved by believing in Christ. There is no such
thing as salvation by proxy. This is one of the most familiar Gospel passages
in Scripture. Believing means the absence of works or any merit you may have.
You do not need to add anything to it – just believe. We know, however, that
when a child has not reached the age of accountability, or when any individual
has a mental handicap to the extent they cannot understand the Gospel and dies,
they are automatically saved. This is God’s grace. </p>

<p class=Verses>“They said, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved,
you and your household.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 16:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 16:31, “believe” is the constantive aorist of <span
lang=EL>πιστευ</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span><span lang=EL> </span>(pisteuō)<i>
</i>and means to believe in a point of time which is perpetuated throughout
eternity and you shall be saved forever. This is referring to an instant of
faith, and it means once and forever you are saved. “Lord” is <span lang=EL>κυ</span>́<span
lang=EL>ριος</span><span lang=EL> </span>(kurios) and means supreme in
authority or God. He is true and sinless humanity. “Jesus” is <span lang=EL>Ι</span>̓<span
lang=EL>ησου</span>͂<span lang=EL>ς</span><span lang=EL> </span>(Iēsous) and
means Jehovah is salvation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Daniel 7:9-10 says that He would be the Ancient of Days,
being God incarnate. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;I kept looking Until thrones were set up, And the
Ancient of Days took His seat; His vesture was like white snow And the hair of
His head like pure wool. His throne was ablaze with flames, Its wheels were a
burning fire. &quot;A river of fire was flowing And coming out from before Him;
Thousands upon thousands were attending Him, And myriads upon myriads were
standing before Him; The court sat, And the books were opened.&quot;  (Daniel
7:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He is the one sent by God to bring salvation. 1 John
4:14-15. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;We have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son
to be the Savior of the world. Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God,
God abides in him, and he in God.&quot;  (1 John 4:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is no other name under heaven whereby one can be
saved. Our Lord’s commission was to go to the Cross and to die spiritually for
the sins of the entire human race. This was His first coming. His second coming
will be to establish the perfect environment of the Millennium and rule on
earth for the 1,000 years. Acts 4:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;And there is salvation in no one else; for there is
no other name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must be
saved.&quot;&quot;  (Acts 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the moment of salvation, we also enter a second phase
of God’s plan for our lives - the filling of the Holy Spirit which enters us
into the fellowship with God. We regain our filling of the Holy Spirit when we
confess our known sins to God the Father when needed. 1 John 1:9. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&quot;  (1 John
1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Ephesians 5:18 “filled” is <span lang=EL>πληρο</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span><span lang=EL> </span>(plēroō) and means to be filled, to
cause to abound, to furnish or supply liberally, which was used by the Greeks
for the afterlife. It is used for the influence of Bible doctrine and its
subsequent application and obedience in our daily lives as advancing
Christians. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore be careful how you walk, not as unwise men but
as wise, making the most of your time, because the days are evil. So then do
not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is. And do not get
drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit,&quot; 
(Ephesians 5:15-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is also referred to as the mind of the Lord Jesus
Christ in 1 Corinthians 2:16. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL
INSTRUCT HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All of the good things you do should be the fruit of the
Spirit or that inward spiritual production because of being filled with the
Spirit. These are the things which glorify the Lord Jesus Christ. Gal. 5:22-23.
</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,
patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against
such things there is no law.&quot;  (Galatians 5:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Scripture contains all the instruction that mankind
requires as far as in God’s plan for each and every one of us. God also
provided a teaching mechanism through the Holy Spirit and pastor-teachers so
that we can learn of His perfect plan for us. The written Scripture tells us
that it is “inspired by God” or God-breathed and that every believer is to
learn it, believe it, and use it to advance in the spiritual life and to
thereby do divine good or “every good work.” 2 Tim. 3:16-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for
teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; so that
the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.&quot;  (2 Timothy
3:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are three phases in God’s plan for our lives. The
first phase is salvation, the second phase is the believer’s life here on
earth, and the third phase is the believer in eternity. At the instant of
physical death, we are promised that there will be no more tears, no more
death, no more mourning, crying, or pain. Rev. 21:3-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And I heard a loud voice from the throne, saying,
&quot;Behold, the tabernacle of God is among men, and He will dwell among them,
and they shall be His people, and God Himself will be among them, and He will
wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there will no longer be any death;
there will no longer be any mourning, or crying, or pain; the first things have
passed away.&quot;&quot;  (Revelation 21:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul said in 2 Corinthians 5:8 that we are to be
encouraged by the fact that one day we all will be absent from our physical
bodies and be at home in heaven or face-to-face with the Lord. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;we are of good courage, I say, and prefer rather to be
absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord.&quot;  (2 Corinthians
5:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>During our time here on earth, our bodies are really not
ours. We are just pilgrims in this life. We just cannot imagine how wonderful
heaven will be. We cannot imagine having total and perfect joy forever and
ever. The doctrine of eternal security applies to both salvation and to our
time here on earth as believers. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are many reasons for the believer to have absolute
confidence in their eternal security. You must have a basis for everything you
believe. The Bible teaches that once you are saved, you are always saved.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Sealing of the Holy Spirit is Our Guarantee</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The sealing of the Holy Spirit is God’s guarantee of
eternal salvation at the moment of faith in Christ. It is God’s promise that He
will take each and every believer from the moment of salvation here on earth to
eternity and our everlasting home in the third heaven.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God gives us 40 things at the moment of salvation. One of
these is the sealing of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit permanently indwells
our body from the point of salvation onward. In contrast, our soul is
controlled by the Spirit whenever we have confessed known sins to God the
Father. The very fact that there is the universal indwelling of the Spirit
there is the universal possibility of the filling of the Spirit. The sealing of
the Holy Spirit is a pledge from God that we have the indwelling of the Spirit.
The seal refers to the signet ring of a ruler. In the ancient world, this seal
verified the authenticity of both the document and that of the sender. 2 Cor.
1:21-22.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now He who establishes us with you in Christ and anointed
us is God, who also sealed us and gave us the Spirit in our hearts as a
pledge.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 1:21-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ephesians 1:13-14 refers to the seal as God’s pledge to
us that our eternal inheritance cannot be broken. This is like God signing a
promise for us, guaranteeing us all the assets He has laid up for us which
relate to the Christian way of life. These blessings are waiting for us whether
we use them or not. The seal is there and it cannot be broken by Satan, by an
unbeliever, or by our very own volition. God has reserved this for us forever. </p>

<p class=Verses>“In Him, you also, after listening to the message of truth, the
gospel of your salvation—having also believed, you were sealed in Him with the
Holy Spirit of promise, who is given as a pledge of our inheritance, with a
view to the redemption of God’s own possession, to the praise of His glory.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians
1:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God desires that every believer stay in fellowship with
the Holy Spirit and grow to spiritual maturity. It also states that we are all
sealed in our redemption from the penalty of sin through the work of Jesus
Christ on the Cross. Eph. 4:30; 2 Tim. 2:19. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed
for the day of redemption.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 4:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Nevertheless, the firm foundation of God stands, having this
seal, “The Lord knows those who are His,” and, “Everyone who names the name of
the Lord is to abstain from wickedness.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Timothy 2:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sealing was a sign of possession. A seal attached to
something signified ownership. No matter what happens after salvation, God owns
us and will deliver us at the point of ultimate sanctification (i.e., the
Rapture of the Church). Anything to which God attaches His seal belongs to God
forever. Through the function of the integrity of God, we are permanently owned
by God. Therefore, the sealing of the Holy Spirit at salvation is a challenge
to every believer to avoid carnality and maintain their progress towards
spiritual maturity, no matter how many times they may fail along the way. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Our Position in Christ</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer has a permanent position in union with Jesus
Christ. Rom. 8:1; Eph. 1:3-6; Jude 1:1; Col. 2:6-12. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in
Christ Jesus.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 8:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ,
just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be
holy and blameless before Him. In love He predestined us to adoption as sons
through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will,
to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely bestowed on us in the
Beloved.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 1:3-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Jude, a bond-servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, To
those who are the called, beloved in God the Father, and kept for Jesus Christ:”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jude
1:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 8:1 “condemnation” is <span lang=EL>κατα</span>́<span
lang=EL>κριμα</span><span lang=EL> </span>(katakrima) and means damnatory
sentence or condemnation. Condemnation is for the unrepentant unbeliever, not
the believer out of fellowship. If the person continues out of fellowship for
long enough, they may die the sin unto death as did King Saul. They will lose
out on all the rewards of eternity, but will not lose their salvation. To say a
Christian can lose their salvation is erroneous and is arrogance. This
arrogance implies wrongly that there is some sin you can commit which is
greater than the provision of Jesus Christ’s atoning work on the Cross for all
sins of mankind.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There will be divine discipline at some points in every
believer’s life as God’s way of trying to get you to confess your sins and get
back with the Word of God. There is never judgment. The Greek verb “are” in
Romans 8:1 is <i>eime</i> and means the absolute status quo existence,
referring to those who always keep on being in Christ Jesus. If there was a
chance you could lose your salvation, it would not say “to those who always
keep on being in Christ Jesus.” We have an eternal union with Christ Jesus. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Through the Baptism of the Spirit at the point of faith
in Christ for salvation, every believer in the Church Age is entered into union
with Jesus Christ. This is called Positional Sanctification and nothing or no
one can remove this position we have in Christ. Rom. 8:38-39. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels,
nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor
height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us
from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
8:38-39, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every believer in the Church Age shares who and what
Christ is. The last phrase “in Christ Jesus our Lord,” means this is our union
with Christ by the Baptism of the Holy Spirit. Because we are in union with
Christ, nothing can separate us from our eternal salvation. We can never get
out of union with Christ. Being in union with Him means we share His life and
His divine righteousness. 1 John 5:11-13; 2 Cor. 5:21. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And the testimony is this, that God has given us eternal
life, and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has the life; he who does
not have the Son of God does not have the life. These things I have written to
you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you
have eternal life.&quot;  (1 John 5:11-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so
that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.&quot;  (2 Corinthians
5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We share the heirship and destiny of Christ. We are
accepted in Christ forever. We can never lose this fantastic position in
Christ. Eph. 1:4-5; Eph. 1:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the
world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him. In love He predestined
us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind
intention of His will,&quot;  (Ephesians 1:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely
bestowed on us in the Beloved.&quot;  (Ephesians 1:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>We are Members of the Body of Christ </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All Church Age believers being members of the Body of
Christ is another reason to believe in eternal security. The Holy Spirit has
baptized all of us into one body. This makes us forever members of the
invisible Body of Christ, Christ being the head of the Body. This means that
once you are baptized, or identified, with Christ, you cannot be unbaptized.
Therefore, we are forever a part of the Body of Christ whether Jew or Gentile,
slaves or free. Our body is a temple of the Holy Spirit. 1 Cor. 12:13-14.</p>

<p class=Verses> “For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether
Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one
Spirit. For the body is not one member, but many.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians
12:13-14, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Shekinah Glory in the temple of the Jews was a sign
of His blessing to them in Old Testament times. We know today that we are under
His blessing with the indwelling and filling of the Holy Spirit. This
indwelling is parlayed into the filling of the Spirit when we are under the
full influence of the Spirit. This Holy Spirit controlling the believer’s soul
in called the filling of the Holy Spirit. Without this filling of the Spirit,
there is no Christian way of life. We regain the full influence of the Holy
Spirit over the soul through confession of our sins to God the Father. In one
passage, we have both the baptism and the indwelling of the Spirit, so as to
emphasize the importance of every member of the body. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 Corinthians 12:18 goes on to say that Jesus Christ has
designated each believer’s function in the Body of Christ, so you should not
have a superiority complex or an inferiority complex. Every member of the Body of
Christ is equally important for the purpose that God has for us in the function
of our spiritual gifts. Christ makes it very clear in 1 Corinthians 12:21 that
He can never tell them He has no use for them. Every member and part of the Body
is important to Him. At the Rapture of the Church, our body will be a perfect
resurrection body, and will be absolutely perfect, just as His is perfect.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the
body, just as He desired.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 12:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the eye cannot say to the hand, “I have no need of you”;
or again the head to the feet, “I have no need of you.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Corinthians 12:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>A Logical Argument for Eternal Security </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A logical argument for eternal security is that God did
the most for us when we were His enemies and logically will do much more for us
as His sons. In Romans 8:31-32, Paul uses a logical argument to present God’s
way of dealing with mankind. This passage says that if God did the greatest
thing possible at salvation by not sparing His own Son, it follows logically
that He can do less than the greatest thereafter by giving each of us eternal
security. “Less than the greatest” is all that God provides for us in grace
during our lifetime and forever in eternity. If the justice of God can provide
the greater work at salvation, it follows logically that the justice of God can
provide the lesser work for the believer.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us,
who is against us? He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him over for
us all, how will He not also with Him freely give us all things?&quot;  (Romans
8:31-32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Where there is knowledge of the Mosaic Law, we know what
is sin and what is not. Where sin increases, grace abounds even more through
the imputed righteousness of God at salvation. We as believers are not lost nor
are we God’s enemies. Now, He can do more than the most for each of us through
His grace policy. This refers also to the logic of the grace of God toward all
believers. Rom. 5:20-21. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The Law came in so that the transgression would increase;
but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more, so that, as sin reigned
in death, even so grace would reign through righteousness to eternal life
through Jesus Christ our Lord.&quot;  (Romans 5:20-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Nothing and no one else can hinder God from conveying
blessings to us except our own negative volition. Eternal security is related
to blessings from God. The believer’s capacity for understanding the purpose
and source of God’s blessing includes total awareness of eternal security. No
believer can attain spiritual maturity without thoroughly understanding the
doctrine of eternal security. Eternal security is not a possibility for a
believer - it is an absolute and permanent reality, whether you know it or not.
Your eternal security was complete and locked from the moment of salvation
onward through eternity. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>We Are Members of God’s Family </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every believer becomes a part of God’s family as a son of
God at salvation and therefore becomes a member of God’s royal family in the
Church Age. Gal. 3:26; John 1:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Galatians
3:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to
become children of God, even to those who believe in His name,&quot;  (John
1:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Greek verb “are” in Galatians 3:26 is <i>eime</i>
which is an absolute status quo verb and means it will always be this way. The
verb’s mood is of reality and means you always keep on being sons of God (i.e.,
eternal security). The Greek word here for “sons” is <i>huios</i> and means
sons of God. This means both male and female persons are sons of God. This came
from the Roman custom of adopting a son into their family. This was true of
Nero. He was adopted into a Roman family. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In application to our spiritual way of life, when we
expressed faith alone in Christ alone, we were brought into the family of God.
We are adults positionally at the moment of salvation through faith only in Him
and apart from any merit or works on our part. This is placing our complete
reliance in God. We must believe that Jesus Christ is the one and only Savior
to be saved. This is the family of God approach. We are born through
regeneration into the royal family of God and we cannot be unborn out of it any
more than we can be physically unborn.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every one of us has a father and a mother. Once we are
born into that family, we remain in that family no matter what we say or do in
our life. Therefore, once we become part of the family of God, we forever
remain in the family of God. Some believers or sons of God will turn out to be
spiritually mature, but most will not due to their own decisions not to
consistently follow God’s plan for their lives. All are given equal
opportunity, but not all take God up on it. No matter what we do, however, none
of us can leave God’s family. This is eternal security.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Our Inheritance in Jesus Christ </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As members of God’s royal family, we all are joint heirs
with Jesus Christ in that we share His destiny. We will always be an heir of
God no matter how we succeed or how we may fail. Rom. 8:16-17; Titus 3:7; Gal.
4:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are
children of God, and if children, heirs also, heirs of God and fellow heirs
with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him so that we may also be glorified with
Him. &quot;  (Romans 8:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;so that being justified by His grace we would be made
heirs according to the hope of eternal life.&quot;  (Titus 3:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore you are no longer a slave, but a son; and if a
son, then an heir through God.&quot;  (Galatians 4:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When we become born again through personal faith in the
substitutionary spiritual death of Jesus Christ for our sins, we are also
promised a resurrection body when we die, which is being reserved for us in
heaven. We will each receive our perfect resurrection body at the Rapture of
the Church. This is because Jesus Christ first received His resurrection body. 1
Peter 1:3-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
who according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living
hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to obtain an
inheritance which is imperishable and undefiled and will not fade away,
reserved in heaven for you, who are protected by the power of God through faith
for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.&quot;  (1 Peter 1:3-5,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is the author of this inheritance since God guards
this inheritance with His perfect character, His perfect power, and His perfect
immutability or inability to change from absolute perfection in every way.
Therefore, we can have a wonderful confidence in relying on God’s power to keep
us and we know we will always have this perfect inheritance and cannot lose it.
Our eternal security is kept by God’s power, not our power. We are protected
also by the power of God through faith unto our deliverance at the Rapture of
the Church. Our eternal inheritance is kept by the power of God just as we are
kept by the power of God forever.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Salvation is The Perfect Gift of Grace</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One of the most powerful passages in the Bible that
presents the Gospel of Jesus Christ as the perfect non-meritorious gift of
grace is Ephesians 2:8-9. This passage says that we were saved in the past
through faith with the result that we keep on being saved forever. This act was
not from ourselves, but was a perfect gift from God to an imperfect person -
each of us. If we did nothing but believe, how can we boast?</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that
not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no
one may boast.&quot;  (Ephesians 2:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Greek tense in Ephesians 2:8-9 is composed of two
verbs. They are the perfect passive participle of <i>sozo</i> which means to be
saved and the present active indicative of <i>eimi</i>. This verb tense in the
Greek was used to provide a more forceful expression. Nothing is more forceful
than the expression of eternal security of the believer in this passage! In the
Greek language, it is so strong that there is no way to possibly “interpret”
this as anything other than what it is. Every believer is graciously given eternal
life in the few seconds it takes to believe in Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This passage indicates that at the moment of our faith in
Jesus Christ, we were saved and will always be saved. This means we all have
eternal security. The verb <i>eimi</i> presents a universal doctrine which is
an absolute truth that will always exist because God will never change. You can
never lose your salvation! Salvation is not relative. Salvation is an absolute.
In the first few seconds when you first believed in Jesus Christ as your
personal Savior, you were given eternal life by God the Father. This verb tense
in the Greek presents a completed action with eternal results - the doctrine of
eternal security.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The perfect tense is also used in Colossians 2:6 and Romans
8:1 indicate that we were saved in the past with the result that you keep on
being saved forever.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk
in Him,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Colossians 2:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in
Christ Jesus.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 8:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Eternal Security Based on God’s Essence </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God never goes back on His essence and character. Rom.
8:35; Rom. 8:38-39; Rom. 14:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will
tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or
sword?”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 8:35, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels,
nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor
height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us
from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
8:38-39, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Who are you to judge the servant of another? To his own master
he stands or falls; and he will stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
14:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>God's Faithfulness</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our eternal security is based on God’s faithfulness.
Although a believer may say they no longer believe in Jesus Christ, God remains
faithful because He is immutable. When a believer denies Christ, they are out
of fellowship and yet God keeps on abiding faithful. He cannot deny the
unconditional quality of our salvation. The Lord Jesus Christ and the Holy
Spirit indwell you and He cannot deny Himself. 1 Cor. 3:4-5; Rev. 19:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For when one says, “I am of Paul,” and another, “I am of
Apollos,” are you not mere men? What then is Apollos? And what is Paul?
Servants through whom you believed, even as the Lord gave opportunity to each
one.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 3:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and He who
sat on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and wages
war.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation 19:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The experience of a believer denying God is found in 2
Timothy 2:11-13. This passage means that if we died with Him or identified
ourselves with Him on the Cross, so shall we live with Him. However, if we died
with him, we also reject human good and evil. This is Retroactive Positional
Truth. Water baptism is a sign of our rejection of anything produced by our old
sin nature and for anything produced by our being filled with the Holy Spirit. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;It is a trustworthy statement: For if we died with Him,
we will also live with Him; If we endure, we will also reign with Him; If we
deny Him, He also will deny us; If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for
He cannot deny Himself.&quot;  (2 Timothy 2:11-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Baptism teaches past and present positional truth. 2
Timothy 2:11-13 also says that if we persevere, we shall also reign with him.
This is a first class condition in the Greek which means that it is a true
statement and refers to those Christians who grow up spiritually. Those who
deny Him, He will also deny them, meaning denying them eternal rewards, but not
denying them salvation. We can be faithless, but He cannot deny Himself, as He
has promised us. He is always faithful. Some Christians deny God, but God is
immutable and unchangeable, and therefore He remains faithful forever.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is no greater promise than eternal security given
by God to the human race. This is seen in Jude 1:24-25 where a doxology is used
to close the message. Here, the message is very clear - God keeps every promise
He has ever made.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling, and to make
you stand in the presence of His glory blameless with great joy, to the only
God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion and
authority, before all time and now and forever. Amen.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jude
1:24-25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We do not keep ourselves from falling. God keeps on
preventing us from falling and He does so by His grace. God has the infinite
power to maintain the relationship that He started when we first expressed our
faith belief in the salvation work of Jesus Christ. This is eternal security
with great joy. This is ultimate sanctification with indescribable happiness.
The word “Amen” means I believe it. God’s promises depend on His power, not our
power. He has promised to keep us from stumbling and He always keeps His
promises.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Peter 1:3-5, God says He will keep any promise He
makes.</p>

<p class=Verses> “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope
through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to obtain an
inheritance which is imperishable and undefiled and will not fade away,
reserved in heaven for you, who are protected by the power of God through faith
for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Peter
1:3-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>God’s Immutability</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is immutable and cannot ever change from His absolute
perfection. Therefore, He cannot cancel the salvation of any believer once He
has given salvation as a grace gift to everyone who believes in Jesus Christ. God
cannot cancel His grace gift to you no matter how bad or sinful you may become.
James 1:17; Eph. 2:8-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Every good thing given and every perfect gift is from
above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation
or shifting shadow.&quot;  (James 1:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that
not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no
one may boast.&quot;  (Ephesians 2:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>God’s Integrity</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The perfect integrity of God cannot be canceled by the
failure or renunciation of any believer living on earth. God is faithful to His
Word. If we died with Him as we have as believers, then we will live with Him
forever. If we endure suffering for blessing, we will rule with Him as mature
believers. If we deny Him by refusing to grow spiritually, He will not be able
to convey rewards and blessings that spiritual growth always brings. Even
though we may be unfaithful, disbelieving, or faithless following our
salvation, He remains faithful because He cannot deny Himself. 2 Tim. 2:11-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;It is a trustworthy statement: For if we died with Him,
we will also live with Him; If we endure, we will also reign with Him; If we
deny Him, He also will deny us; If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for
He cannot deny Himself.&quot;  (2 Timothy 2:11-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>God’s Eternal Life</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Eternal life means eternal security. When we were born
physically, God imputed human life to our soul. When we believed in Christ, God
the Holy Spirit created a human spirit, to which God the Father imputed eternal
life. Eternal life is the basis for eternal security. Eternal life is life
forever with God. Both eternal life and eternal security are guaranteed by the
virtue or integrity of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is perfect integrity, holiness, and virtue. He is
immutable, and always has perfect integrity. Therefore, God always keeps His
word. Whoever believes in Jesus Christ will be given eternal life. If you have
had faith alone in Christ alone, you have been given God’s very own eternal
life. John 3:15-16; John 3:36; Acts 13:48; John 5:24.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; so that whoever believes will in Him have eternal life.
&quot;For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that
whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life. &quot;  (John
3:15-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he
who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on
him.&quot;&quot;  (John 3:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“When the Gentiles heard this, they began rejoicing and
glorifying the word of the Lord; and as many as had been appointed to eternal
life believed.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 13:48, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses> ““Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears My word, and
believes Him who sent Me, has eternal life, and does not come into judgment,
but has passed out of death into life.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 5:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In pre-salvation grace, the Holy Spirit takes your faith
belief in Jesus Christ and makes it effective for salvation. At that moment,
every believer receives eternal life which cannot be canceled. This eternal
life is in union with Christ. 1 John 5:11-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And the testimony is this, that God has given us eternal
life, and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has the life; he who does
not have the Son of God does not have the life. These things I have written to
you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you
have eternal life.&quot;  (1 John 5:11-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Eternal security is an unbreakable relationship because
it depends entirely on who and what God is, never on who and what we are. Grace
always depends on God’s divine policy in dealing with us as believers. Your
weaknesses cannot cancel God's strength. Your failures cannot nullify or reduce
in any way the integrity of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>God’s Love</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God loves the entire human race with a divine
unconditional love. This absolute love is based on God’s own perfect
characteristics and is motivated by His infinite love. This is the basis for
salvation through the work of Jesus Christ. Christ died spiritually as a
substitute for the entire human race. As believers, we all receive divine
unconditional love because we each now have the very righteousness of God and
we share it in union with the Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, we have something
that God loves, His righteousness and eternal life. We cannot earn the
imputation of divine righteousness. Because we are now justified by means of
His atoning work on the Cross, we have been delivered from the wrath of God and
cannot lose our salvation. Rom. 5:8-10; Eph. 1:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we
were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, having now been justified
by His blood, we shall be saved from the wrath of God through Him. For if while
we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much
more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
5:8-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world,
that we would be holy and blameless before Him. In love”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians
1:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He loves every believer unconditionally. God also has a
divine personal love for the few who fulfill God’s plan for them in the
Christian way of life through positive volition to Bible truth. They grow up
spiritually and God gives them blessings on that basis. These blessings are
imputed to the righteousness which they have in their souls. Divine
unconditional love also is given in eternity to all believers in heaven as they
have perfect resurrection bodies. Additionally, God gives divine personal love
to those in heaven who have matured spiritually while on earth. These are part
of our eternal rewards for growing spiritually and living our lives as unto the
Lord. John 3:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;For God so loved the world, that He gave His only
begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal
life. &quot;  (John 3:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>These are the few who have taken the narrow road and have
become the friends of God. There is no fear in <i>agape</i> love which is God’s
perfect unconditional love for us. This casts out all fear including any fear
of condemnation. Nothing can separate us from the love of God which is in union
with Jesus Christ our Lord. 1 John 4:17-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;By this, love is perfected with us, so that we may have
confidence in the day of judgment; because as He is, so also are we in this
world. There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear
involves punishment, and the one who fears is not perfected in love.&quot;  (1
John 4:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We, as believers, are God’s sons and He can show His
personal love for us. By the transgression of Adam, we all are born spiritually
dead. By the spiritual death of Christ, the grace of God can abound toward the
many who accept this salvation work. Those who receive the abundance of grace
in this life can also receive great spiritual blessing, the much more grace of
God. Rom. 5:15-17.</p>

<p class=Verses> “But the free gift is not like the transgression. For if by
the transgression of the one the many died, much more did the grace of God and
the gift by the grace of the one Man, Jesus Christ, abound to the many. The
gift is not like that which came through the one who sinned; for on the one
hand the judgment arose from one transgression resulting in condemnation, but
on the other hand the free gift arose from many transgressions resulting in
justification. For if by the transgression of the one, death reigned through
the one, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of
righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
5:15-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>God’s Sovereignty</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God does not desire unbelievers to be lost or perish. 2
Peter 3:9; Jude 1:24-25. </p>

<p class=Verses>“The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some count
slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing for any to perish but for all
to come to repentance.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Peter 3:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling, and to make
you stand in the presence of His glory blameless with great joy, to the only
God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion and
authority, before all time and now and forever. Amen.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jude
1:24-25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Those that perish do so willingly because they reject
Christ as Savior. God never desires one of his own to perish, or lose their
salvation, and since God is not willing for this to happen, it most certainly
will not happen. It is His sovereign will. Once saved, always saved! John 3:36.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he
who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on
him.&quot;&quot;  (John 3:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>God’s Righteousness</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is the double portion of sharing the righteousness
of God and eternal life. The doctrine of imputation says that at the moment of
salvation the righteousness of God is credited to our account. Each of us now
have this perfect standing in heaven. Also at the moment of salvation, every
believer received the eternal life of God. There are no exceptions. God’s
eternal life is imputed to our human spirit which God the Holy Spirit also
created for us at the moment of salvation. 2 Cor. 5:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so
that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.&quot;  (2 Corinthians
5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When we receive Christ as our Savior, God actually
imputes to our soul His very own perfect righteousness. At that same moment,
the Holy Spirit enters us into union with Christ called the Baptism of the Holy
Spirit. Here, we share His absolute righteousness. When we first shared His
righteousness, the justice of God was immediately able to allow His omnipotence
to impute His eternal life to our regenerated human spirit. He has given us His
righteousness and His life, so that we are qualified to live with Him forever.
Regeneration is everything that is represented by eternal life in the Christian
soul. We can do nothing to make it happen or help make it happen - God does
everything. Rom. 9:30-33; Rom. 3:22-28; Rom. 4:2-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;What shall we say then? That Gentiles, who did not pursue
righteousness, attained righteousness, even the righteousness which is by
faith; but Israel, pursuing a law of righteousness, did not arrive at that law.
Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as though it were by works.
They stumbled over the stumbling stone, just as it is written, &quot;BEHOLD, I
LAY IN ZION A STONE OF STUMBLING AND A ROCK OF OFFENSE, AND HE WHO BELIEVES IN
HIM WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.&quot;&quot;  (Romans 9:30-33, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something
to boast about, but not before God. For what does the Scripture say?
&quot;ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS CREDITED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS.&quot;
Now to the one who works, his wage is not credited as a favor, but as what is
due. But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the
ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness,&quot;  (Romans 4:2-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At that same moment of salvation, the Baptism of the Holy
Spirit enters us into union with the Lord Jesus Christ, where we share His
eternal life. The doctrine of the double portion says we have the double
portion of God’s righteousness and the double portion of God’s eternal life.
Imputation is a wonderful reason to have confidence in your eternal security.
Wherever you study imputation in the Bible, it teaches that whatever is imputed
by God stays imputed. When God imputes something, it is perfect and because He
is immutable, He cannot change His mind and He cannot reverse His decision. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The imputation of divine righteousness is the only means
of justification. Justification is an eternal relationship with God based on
His integrity, not ours. It is based upon our possession of His righteousness. Rom.
5:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace
with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom also we have obtained our
introduction by faith into this grace in which we stand; and we exult in hope
of the glory of God.&quot;  (Romans 5:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The phrase “this grace in which we stand,” does not refer
to our morality or self-righteousness, but the virtue of God. Our relationship
with God does not depend on our integrity, morality, or virtue. It depends on
His holiness and integrity. The spiritual life is not morality, but far above
morality. Virtue is infinitely greater than morality, but virtue can only be
produced by the filling of the Spirit and the intake and application of Bible
doctrine. Morality can be produced by human self-determination and the energy
of the flesh. This is why so many unbelievers have a morality greater than that
of some believers.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The moment we believe in Jesus Christ, God gives us 40
things. Demons cannot cancel those 40 things. We cannot cancel them by
renouncing God or our faith. Our relationship is based on grace - never on our
merit. God always provides the grace and our eternal standing. If we stood
based on our own strength, we would collapse. We stand in the grace of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You have to be arrogant to think you can commit a sin or
renounce God such that it can cancel the work of God! There is nothing the
believer can do to cancel the faith decision of believing in Christ. No one has
the power or ability to cancel it, no matter how evil they become. In other
words, God is greater than all of us. Still, some people are so arrogant that
they think they are greater than God. The dumbest people around are those who
think they can reject eternal security by attempting to cancel the grace of
God. It cannot be done!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Man's failure does not abrogate the integrity of God.
Man's weakness does not cancel God's strength. Lack of integrity in the
believer cannot cancel the integrity of God. Failure to execute god’s plan for
your life does not cancel your eternal salvation! Unfortunately, we seem to be
far more impressed with our failures than with the integrity of God. That is
our problem. We need to be more impressed with the integrity of God and less
impressed with our failures. This is why many believers don't believe in eternal
security. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Knowing the doctrine of eternal security shouldn’t cause
you to go out and raise hell. Rather, it should motivate you to want to know
more about this wonderful God who has permanently provided such fantastic
things for you because of one non-meritorious decision you made in a few
seconds.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The possession of the righteousness of God forever
eliminates the possibility of losing salvation by any failure on our part. Our
righteousness breaks down because we have an old sin nature. In contrast, God’s
righteousness will never let us down. We have it permanently. Therefore, we
stand before God, not on the basis of our righteousness, but on the basis of
His righteousness. It is the quintessence of human arrogance to assume we can
do anything to cancel or abrogate our eternal salvation. The integrity of God
is infinitely greater than any failure of man. The doctrine of eternal security
is based on the fact that the integrity of God is at stake. God gives and does
not withdraw. He does not and cannot take back anything He gives - ever.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Jesus Christ’s Work on the Cross</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Denying eternal security is to deny the finished work of
the Lord Jesus Christ and reduces the sacrifice of Jesus Christ to the level of
offering bulls and goats. The sacrifice of Christ abides. John 5:24; Heb.
10:14. </p>
