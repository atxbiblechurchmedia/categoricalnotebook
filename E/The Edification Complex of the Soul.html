<h2><a name="_D-The_Edification_Complex"></a><a name="_The_Edification_Complex"></a>The
Edification Complex of the Soul</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The edification complex of the soul is a term for the
attainment of spiritual maturity based on the persistent accumulation and
application of <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the soul. Actually,
the construction material for the edification complex of the soul is <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine. Eph. 4:24.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and put on the new self, which in the likeness of God has been
created in righteousness and holiness of the truth.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians
4:24, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Greek word for “edification” is oἰκοδομή
(oikodomē) and in the overall sense means construction, building up or the
building process. It is a noun built on compounds and has a dual connotation. For
each Church Age believer, <i>oikodomē</i> means to edify, to build or erect a
structure and refers to the spiritual growth of the positive believer in the
Christian way of life that glorifies God. The following three nouns are used
for edification. Rom. 14:19; 2 Cor. 10:8; 2 Cor. 13:10; 1 Cor. 14:5; 1 Cor. 14:12;
1 Cor. 14:26; Eph. 4:12; Eph. 4:16; Eph. 4:29.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“So then we pursue the things which make for peace and the
building up of one another.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 14:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For even if I boast somewhat further about our authority,
which the Lord gave for building you up and not for destroying you, I will not
be put to shame,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Corinthians 10:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason I am writing these things while absent, so
that when present I need not use severity, in accordance with the authority
which the Lord gave me for building up and not for tearing down.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2
Corinthians 13:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Overall, edification refers to the building up of the Body
of Christ during the Church Age. When the body of Christ is completed, the
Rapture of the Church will occur. <span lang=EL>Οι</span>̓<span lang=EL>κοδομη</span>́
(oikodomē) is the act of building or erecting a structure. The process of
construction. Eph. 4:12; Eph. 4:16; Eph. 4:29.</p>

<p class=Verses>“for the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to
the building up of the body of Christ;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by
what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual
part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians
4:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth, but only such
a word as is good for edification according to the need of the moment, so that
it will give grace to those who hear.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 4:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span lang=EL>Οι</span>̓<span lang=EL>κονομι</span>́<span
lang=EL>α</span> (oikonomia) is the result of construction, the completed
structure, hence a complete edification complex of the soul. In 1 Timothy 1:4,
the term “administration” is used in the sense of stewardship of the resulting
structure that God has built in our souls - the edification complex of <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“nor to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which
give rise to mere speculation rather than furthering the administration of God
which is by faith.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Timothy 1:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Oἰκοδόμος (oikodomos) is the builder or contractor,
which is Bible doctrine communicated to the believer’s human spirit while being
filled with the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit’s transfer of that spiritually
understood information to the left lobe of the soul as gnosis or understood
spiritual knowledge. If the believer expresses positive volition (believes it
and accepts it) toward that gnosis Bible doctrine, the Holy Spirit then
transfers and converts the gnosis Bible doctrine into epignosis Bible doctrine
in the right lobe of the soul. Here, that doctrine is ready for application to
the spiritual life. This process is repeated many, many times, thus
constructing an accumulation of the very thinking of Jesus Christ – divine
wisdom. This is the grace apparatus for perception. Acts 4:11. See category on <a
href="#_Grace_Apparatus_For">The Grace Apparatus for Perception.</a></p>

<p class=Verses>““He is the STONE WHICH WAS REJECTED by you, THE BUILDERS, but
WHICH BECAME THE CHIEF CORNER stone.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 4:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Structure of the Edification Complex</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The “structure” which God the Holy Spirit builds within
the right lobe of the believer’s soul is illustrated with five “floors” or
major components and is built using <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine. <i>Epignosis</i>
doctrine means residing doctrine, usable doctrine, Bible teaching which has had
faith applied to it and then transferred to the right lobe of the soul or the
heart. It is the result of the repeated use the grace apparatus for perception.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><img border=0 width=580 height=400 id="Picture 1"
src="The%20Edification%20Complex%20of%20the%20Soul.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Foundation</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The edification complex foundation is the filling of the
Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit empowers the believer’s spiritual life. This is
the same power that enables the believer to understand Bible doctrine taught
and to convert that believed doctrine to <i>epignosis</i> in the right lobe of
the soul. The filling or controlling ministry of the Holy Spirit is needed
every time you get out of fellowship. The believer is promised by God the
Father in 1 John 1:9, that every time the believer names or cites their known
sins to Him, He forgives the known sins and also the unknown or forgotten sins
and restores the believer’s soul to fellowship with Him. The believer is now
filled with the Holy Spirit and can learn and apply Bible doctrine to life’s
situations. Eph. 5:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&quot;  (1 John
1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation,
but be filled with the Spirit,&quot;  (Ephesians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The edification complex can only be built using the power
of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is the power that generates the building
material in the soul – <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All Church Age believers are given divine grace resources
as members of the royal family of God to fulfill the plan of God for our lives.
These resources are provided by God the Father. God the Son continues to uphold
and preserve the universe by the word of His power.  Jesus Christ also
guarantees the protection of the positive believer for the fulfillment of His
will. The omnipotence of God the Holy Spirit provides the divine empowerment
for every believer to live and grow in the spiritual life designed for each of
us exactly as it was first used by the humanity of Jesus Christ while on earth.
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The First Floor</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first floor of the edification complex is doctrinal
orientation whereby the believer gains “sound judgment” or objective thinking
based on the absolutes of the Word of God. This thinking replaces or renovates
the subjective thinking of human viewpoint to become divine viewpoint or grace
thinking based on Bible doctrine in the soul. The believer becomes more
oriented to God's grace resources that have been provided and are revealed
through sound Bible doctrine. The believer then gains a new spiritual perspective
that reveals God's plan for their life. The believer oriented to the grace of
God regards every day as a gift from God. Rom. 12:3; Rom. 14:5-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For through the grace given to me I say to everyone among you
not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think; but to think so as
to have sound judgment, as God has allotted to each a measure of faith.”
(Romans 12:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;One person regards one day above another, another regards
every day alike. Each person must be fully convinced in his own mind. He who
observes the day, observes it for the Lord, and he who eats, does so for the
Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he who eats not, for the Lord he does not
eat, and gives thanks to God.&quot;  (Romans 14:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Second Floor</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The second floor of the edification complex is a genuine
humility which includes teachability. This is authority orientation to the Word
of God and also to those who God has placed in positions of authority over you.
This humility includes orientation to the rule of law, the laws of divine
establishment and an understanding of the authority included in the Divine
Institutions that are a part of the laws of divine establishment. 2 Cor. 13:10.
</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason I am writing these things while absent, so
that when present I need not use severity, in accordance with the authority
which the Lord gave me for building up and not for tearing down.” (2
Corinthians 13:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Peter 5:5, the Greek word for “humility” is <span
lang=EL>ταπεινοφροσυ</span>́<span lang=EL>νη</span> (tapeinophrosunē) and
means a mental attitude thought pattern of grace. Grace thinking recognizes
that we, at no time, earn or deserve any blessing from God.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;You younger men, likewise, be subject to your elders; and
all of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, for GOD IS
OPPOSED TO THE PROUD, BUT GIVES GRACE TO THE HUMBLE.&quot;  (1 Peter 5:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Humility understands that everything depends on who and
what God is and all that He has done. Humility-grace thinking causes the
believer to have no illusion about themselves. Thus, the believer has an
edification complex in their soul instead of an inferiority complex or
superiority complex. They have a relaxed mental attitude.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mental attitude humility produces a relaxed mental
attitude toward believers that have authority over you. This mental attitude
grace enables the spiritual believer to submit to the teaching authority of
another believer, the pastor-teacher, in order to learn Bible doctrine. Only
true humility through the enabling power of the Holy Spirit allows learning of
Bible doctrine. This process causes the believer to become spiritual
self-sustaining.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Third Floor </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The third floor of the edification complex is the
development of a personal love for God the Father. This personal love is
developed through spiritual growth whereby the believer begins to better
understand who God really is, His perfect grace plan, and all that God has
done, what He is continually doing to uphold the believer, and what God has
planned for our eternal future. This is a love for God because of who and what
He is. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Fourth Floor</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fourth floor of the edification complex is impersonal
or unconditional love for others. This includes a relaxed mental attitude
toward others even under difficult circumstances. This is a mental attitude of
patience, forgiveness, graciousness, compassion, and kindness toward others no
matter what they have said or done even if that includes opposition and
hostility toward you. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is the unconditional love for others that depends on
the Bible doctrine in your soul, not the attractiveness of the object of that
love. This is the mental attitude that Jesus Christ demonstrated toward
everyone every day, even to those who were torturing Him and crucifying Him.
This is a very powerful love that reflects the believer’s level of spiritual
maturity and is the very thinking of Jesus Christ. 1 Cor. 2:16. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT
HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.” (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Fifth Floor</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fifth floor of the edification complex is an inner
happiness or sharing the perfect happiness of God the Father. This is a
happiness that masters the details of life without depending on any person or
anything else but the grace of God. Prov. 3:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“How blessed is the man who finds wisdom And the man who gains
understanding.” (Proverbs 3:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Happiness, in its fullest meaning, is the utmost pleasure
we are capable of enjoying in any given situation. Because we are referring to
inner happiness, it can be a situation of prosperity or suffering. Remember,
receiving and retaining inner happiness is something being possessed within our
souls, and is not conditioned by any overt situation or circumstance.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Inner happiness, or God's happiness, is still a potential
to the Christian and depends upon their spiritual growth through the daily
intake and obedience to Bible truth. The first taste of inner happiness comes
from the filling of the Spirit according to Galatians 5:22, Romans 14:17, and 1
Thessalonians 1:6. Happiness is the extension of a relaxed mental attitude.
Such happiness is a mental attitude of joy.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,
patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,&quot;  (Galatians 5:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but
righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.&quot;  (Romans 14:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;You also became imitators of us and of the Lord, having
received the word in much tribulation with the joy of the Holy Spirit,&quot; 
(1 Thessalonians 1:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The experience of inner happiness is limited by the
capacity developed from learning and applying Bible truth from positive
volition. If you have <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the right lobe of your
soul, you have capacity for great happiness. As a new believer, you lack this
capacity and only have the filling of the Spirit without any Bible teaching in
your soul as yet. In order to have great inner happiness on a daily basis
regardless of any circumstance in life, we must possess maximum Bible doctrine
in our soul. This provides the spiritual dynamic to remain Spirit-filled a
maximum amount of the time on a daily basis. The believer carries happiness
with them. Whether circumstances are pleasant or unpleasant, they are the same.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Once you have achieved spiritual maturity through the
maximum intake and application of God's Word, the Lord then shares His own
happiness with you on a maximum basis as seen in John 17:13, John 17:17, and 1
John 1:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;But now I come to You; and these things I speak in
the world so that they may have My joy made full in themselves. &quot;  (John
17:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth.
&quot;  (John 17:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;These things we write, so that our joy may be made
complete.&quot;  (1 John 1:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Synonyms For the Edification Complex</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are many synonyms for the edification complex of
the soul. “Building up” in Ephesians 4:12 and Ephesians 4:16 and “edification” in
Ephesians 4:29. The Greek word here is <span lang=EL>οι</span>̓<span lang=EL>κοδομη</span>́
(oikodomē) and means the act of building or erecting a structure or the
process of construction. In this case, it applies to a structure in the soul.</p>

which is true in Him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the
true Light is already shining. The one who says he is in the Light and yet
hates his brother is in the darkness until now. The one who loves his brother
abides in the Light and there is no cause for stumbling in him. But the one who
hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness, and does not
know where he is going because the darkness has blinded his eyes.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1

the building up of the body of Christ;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by
what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual
part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians
4:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth, but only such
a word as is good for edification according to the need of the moment, so that
it will give grace to those who hear.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 4:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The condition of a local church where the believers
possess edification complexes in their soul results from the communication of
Bible doctrine by the pastor-teacher for the edification of the congregation.
Eph. 4:11-12; Acts 9:31.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some
as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the
saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ;”
(Ephesians 4:11-12, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria
enjoyed peace, being built up; and going on in the fear of the Lord and in the
comfort of the Holy Spirit, it continued to increase.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 9:31,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The prosperity of a local church is not determined by its
size, its membership, its giving, how many were baptized at a certain time, or
any other public relations approach. The prosperity of a church is determined
by the number of edification complexes in that congregation. No church should
ever be evaluated in terms of being friendly or unfriendly. The church isn’t a
lonely hearts club. The purpose of a local church is not to be able to get
acquainted with nice people or with people who can help you in business. The
objective is to come to hear the Word of God and receive it or reject it in
privacy.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is a contrast between edification and the use of
the temporary spiritual gift of tongues. The objective of the Christian life is
the erection of an edification complex in the soul, not speaking in tongues. The
function of tongues was to give the Gospel to unbelievers in their own language
by someone with the gift who had never learned that language. It was a
supernatural gift and got a lot of attention when used properly. It was also a
warning of the coming fifth cycle of discipline to Israel which occurred forty
years later in 70 AD. The use of tongues has not been bona fide since. 1 Cor.
14:3-4; 1 Cor. 14:12; 1 Cor. 14:26.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But one who prophesies speaks to men for edification and
exhortation and consolation. One who speaks in a tongue edifies himself; but
one who prophesies edifies the church.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 14:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“So also you, since you are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek to
abound for the edification of the church.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 14:12,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“What is the outcome then, brethren? When you assemble, each
one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an
interpretation. Let all things be done for edification.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Corinthians 14:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Human knowledge puffs up, but Bible doctrine edifies when
taken into the soul through the filling of the Holy Spirit. 1 Corinthians 14:26
has been terribly misused and abused. You’ve likely heard people say, don’t
learn too much doctrine, you’ll get fat-headed. This refers to <i>gnosis</i> in
any field of knowledge, including scriptural knowledge, which puffs up. 1 Cor
8:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now concerning things sacrificed to idols, we know that we all
have knowledge. Knowledge makes arrogant, but love edifies.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Corinthians 8:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Communication gifts are designed for the edification of
the believer. 2 Cor. 10:8; 2 Cor. 13:10; Eph. 4:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For even if I boast somewhat further about our authority,
which the Lord gave for building you up and not for destroying you, I will not
be put to shame,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Corinthians 10:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason I am writing these things while absent, so
that when present I need not use severity, in accordance with the authority
which the Lord gave me for building up and not for tearing down.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2
Corinthians 13:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“for the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to
the building up of the body of Christ;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The filling of the Holy Spirit is necessary for the
function of the grace apparatus for perception. John 14:26; John 16:12-14; 1
Cor. 2:9-16; Eph. 5:18; 1 John 2:27.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will
send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance
all that I said to you.” (John 14:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but
be filled with the Spirit,” (Ephesians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“As for you, the anointing which you received from Him abides
in you, and you have no need for anyone to teach you; but as His anointing
teaches you about all things, and is true and is not a lie, and just as it has
taught you, you abide in Him.” (1 John 2:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The right lobe of the soul is the target for the grace
apparatus for perception and is where the edification complex is constructed. 1
Cor. 2:12-13; Rom. 8:16, Job 32:8. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the
Spirit who is from God, so that we may know the things freely given to us by
God, which things we also speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in
those taught by the Spirit, combining spiritual thoughts with spiritual words.”
(1 Corinthians 2:12-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are
children of God,” (Romans 8:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;But it is a spirit in man, And the breath of the
Almighty gives them understanding.” (Job 32:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Only <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the right lobe of
the soul can be used for the construction of the edification complex. Eph.
4:23-24; 1 John 2:3; 1 John 2:27; Col. 1:9-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind, and put on
the new self, which in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness
and holiness of the truth.” (Ephesians 4:23-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“By this we know that we have come to know Him, if we keep His
commandments.” (1 John 2:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“As for you, the anointing which you received from Him abides
in you, and you have no need for anyone to teach you; but as His anointing
teaches you about all things, and is true and is not a lie, and just as it has
taught you, you abide in Him.” (1 John 2:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason also, since the day we heard of it, we have
not ceased to pray for you and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge
of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding, so that you will walk in
a manner worthy of the Lord, to please Him in all respects, bearing fruit in
every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God;” (Colossians 1:9-10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The rapid construction of the edification complex is
accomplished through the daily intake of doctrine and faith-patience under
pressure. Pressure causes a person to realize that doctrine is the answer. James
1:3-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance. And
let endurance have its perfect result, so that you may be perfect and complete,
lacking in nothing.” (James 1:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The humanity of Christ possessed an edification complex.
By the time he was 12 years old, He was building it very rapidly. Luke 2:40; Luke
2:52; John 1:14. </p>

<p class=Verses>“The Child continued to grow and become strong, increasing in
wisdom; and the grace of God was upon Him.” (Luke 2:40, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And Jesus kept increasing in wisdom and stature, and in favor
with God and men.” (Luke 2:52, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw His
glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.”
(John 1:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Prerequisites of Edification </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The filling of the Spirit is the only empowerment for the
intake of Bible doctrine. John 14:26; John 16:12-14; 1 Cor. 2:9-16.</p>

<p class=Verses>““But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in
My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I
said to you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 14:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““I have many more things to say to you, but you cannot bear
them now. “But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all
the truth; for He will not speak on His own initiative, but whatever He hears,
He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come. “He will glorify
Me, for He will take of Mine and will disclose it to you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John
16:12-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Confession of sin biblically is the only means of regaining
the filling of the Spirit. Prov. 1:23; 1 Cor. 11:31-32; 1 John 1:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Turn to my reproof, Behold, I will pour out my spirit on you;
I will make my words known to you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 1:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But if we judged ourselves rightly, we would not be judged.
But when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord so that we will not be
condemned along with the world.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 11:31-32, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
John 1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual knowledge (gnosis) is transferred by the Holy
Spirit to the left lobe of the soul from the human spirit through the daily communication
of Bible doctrine. Eph. 4:20-24; 1 John 2:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But you did not learn Christ in this way, if indeed you have
heard Him and have been taught in Him, just as truth is in Jesus, that, in
reference to your former manner of life, you lay aside the old self, which is
being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit, and that you be renewed
in the spirit of your mind, and put on the new self, which in the likeness of
God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians
4:20-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“By this we know that we have come to know Him, if we keep His
commandments.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 John 2:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Through faith belief in the Bible doctrine taught and
understood, the Holy Spirit transfers the <i>gnosis</i> from the left lobe of
the soul to the right lobe of the soul where it becomes <i>epignosis</i> or
believed Bible doctrine. This <i>epignosis</i> or residual doctrine is the only
form of spiritual truth that is applicable to the spiritual life and forms the
basis of the edification complex or structure. Eph. 3:13-21; Col. 1:9-14; Col.
2:7; Col. 3:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“having been firmly rooted and now being built up in Him and
established in your faith, just as you were instructed, and overflowing with
gratitude.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Colossians 2:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and have put on the new self who is being renewed to a true
knowledge according to the image of the One who created him—”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Colossians
3:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Results of the Edification Complex</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Word of Truth is applied, divine good is produced. <i>Epignosis</i>
is applied to life’s situations from the right lobe of the soul. This is the
salt and light principle. Eph. 4:23-24; Matt. 5:13-16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind, and put on
the new self, which in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness
and holiness of the truth.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 4:23-24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt has become
tasteless, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything,
except to be thrown out and trampled under foot by men. “You are the light of
the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden; nor does anyone light a lamp
and put it under a basket, but on the lampstand, and it gives light to all who
are in the house. “Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may
see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew
5:13-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The glory of God is reflected. Any reference to “light”
or “lights” on the part of believers is applicable here. 1 John 1:7; Phil.
2:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but if we walk in the Light as He Himself is in the Light, we
have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us
from all sin.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 John 1:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and
innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse
generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Philippians
2:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The stability of the believer is apparent. Col. 2:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“having been firmly rooted and now being built up in Him and
established in your faith, just as you were instructed, and overflowing with
gratitude.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Colossians 2:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Stockpiling <i>epignosis</i> in the right lobe of the
soul results in a growing spiritual IQ. Eph. 3:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that
you may be filled up to all the fullness of God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 3:19,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Christian fulfills the purpose for which they are on earth.
The whole issue in the Christian life is edification or tearing down. Tearing
down does not mean loss of salvation in this passage, but no erection of an
edification complex. Instead pseudo-building materials are tried that are
useless and cannot ever build an edification complex. 1 Corinthians 3 indicates
that the building must have the proper spiritual materials. 2 Cor. 13:10-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason I am writing these things while absent, so
that when present I need not use severity, in accordance with the authority
which the Lord gave me for building up and not for tearing down. Finally,
brethren, rejoice, be made complete, be comforted, be like-minded, live in
peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you.” (2 Corinthians
13:10-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divine viewpoint
replaces the human viewpoint. Eph. 4:25.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, laying aside falsehood, SPEAK TRUTH EACH ONE of you
WITH HIS NEIGHBOR, for we are members of one another.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians
4:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Discernment
minus mental attitude sins. Eph. 4:26.</p>

<p class=Verses>“BE ANGRY, AND yet DO NOT SIN; do not let the sun go down on
your anger,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 4:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>No room for
Satan’s doctrine in the soul. Eph. 4:27.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and do not give the devil an opportunity.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians
4:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The production
of divine good in business. Eph. 4:28.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He who steals must steal no longer; but rather he must labor,
performing with his own hands what is good, so that he will have something to
share with one who has need.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 4:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The avoidance of the sins of the tongue. A sign of the
maturity of your edification complex is if you are sinning in this area. If
many sins of the tongue, you are a babe or adolescent, not a mature believer.
Eph. 4:29.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth, but only such
a word as is good for edification according to the need of the moment, so that
it will give grace to those who hear.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 4:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The avoidance of the grieving of the Holy Spirit. Eph.
4:31.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander
be put away from you, along with all malice.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 4:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The function of grace. Eph. 4:32.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other,
just as God in Christ also has forgiven you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 4:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual motivation from edification. Edification is the
motivation for unconditional love toward others which provides the tolerance
toward other believers thus allowing them to grow spiritually. Rom. 15:2; 1
Cor. 8:1; 1 Cor. 10:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Each of us is to please his neighbor for his good, to his
edification.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 15:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now concerning things sacrificed to idols, we know that we all
have knowledge. Knowledge makes arrogant, but love edifies.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Corinthians 8:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“All things are lawful, but not all things are profitable. All
things are lawful, but not all things edify.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 10:23,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Grace blessings during the believer’s life. A local
church’s prosperity is directly related to the number of maturing believers in
that church. A nation’s prosperity is also directly related to the number of
maturing believers in that nation. Acts 9:31.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria
enjoyed peace, being built up; and going on in the fear of the Lord and in the
comfort of the Holy Spirit, it continued to increase.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 9:31,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Eternal grace blessings for the believer will be received
at the Judgment Seat of Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Adverse circumstances demonstrate the believer’s ability
to cope with rapidly changing circumstances. The edification complex causes the
believer to stand up under circumstances that change to adversity. 2 Cor. 6:4-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“but in everything commending ourselves as servants of God, in
much endurance, in afflictions, in hardships, in distresses, in beatings, in
imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in sleeplessness, in hunger, in purity,
in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in genuine love, in
the word of truth, in the power of God; by the weapons of righteousness for the
right hand and the left, by glory and dishonor, by evil report and good report;
regarded as deceivers and yet true; as unknown yet well-known, as dying yet
behold, we live; as punished yet not put to death,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Corinthians
6:4-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Therefore, the believer with the edification complex is
stabiliz­ed. Stability from the edification complex causes immediate adjustment
to rapidly changing circumstances. Adaptability is the utilization of the <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine in the edification complex to sudden changes of circumstances.
Adaptability manifested by the believer brings glory to God. Adaptability is
perpetuation of stability into extremes of suffering.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If the believer is without an edification complex,
rapidly changing circumstances cause the believer to become disoriented to the
grace of God. A believer’s happiness does not depend on what people think of them.
The edification complex manifests the glory of God under suffering or rapidly
changing circumstances.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Importance of the Local Church in Edification</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 14:12, “So also you” is a Greek idiom
that should be translated, “this applies to you.” The Corinthians were eager to
get the gift of tongues because it was spectacular and signaled to others that they
were spiritual. In reality, the worst believers in the Bible are described as
having the gift of tongues. “Seek to abound” means you should emphasize
spiritual gifts that edify the Church. The primary spiritual gift in this
category is the gift of pastor-teacher.  The pre-Canon temporary spiritual gifts
did not edify the Church.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So also you, since you are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek to
abound for the edification of the church.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 14:12,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 Corinthians 14:26 emphasizes that all be done in the
local church for edification. There are a number of ways in which we worship
God, but they must all relate to our spiritual growth.  Everything in assembly
worship should be done with a view toward the objective, which is edification. 
The objective is to communicate doctrine, the purpose of which is to produce
edification.</p>

<p class=Verses>“What is the outcome then, brethren? When you assemble, each
one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an
interpretation. Let all things be done for edification.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Corinthians 14:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Edification is the key to the operation of the local
church.  Edification, or the advance to spiritual maturity, is the objective of
the Christian way of life.  In the context of 1 Corinthians 14, the gift of
tongues did not fulfill that purpose.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 Corinthians 14:40 concludes that the gift of tongues
did not do all things properly and in an orderly manner in the Corinthian
church. The gift of tongues only existed for the first 40 years of the Church
Age. Then it was discontinued when the fifth cycle of discipline was
administered to Israel by the Romans in August of 70 A.D. While it did exist,
the gift of tongues illustrated how not to do things decently and in order. For
tongues did not contribute to the principle of edification, nor did it contribute
to doing things properly and in an orderly manner.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But all things must be done properly and in an orderly manner.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Corinthians 14:40, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Pseudo-edification Complexes</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The foundation for the pseudo-edification complex is the
lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes. The building is the pride of life.
1 John 2:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the
lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life, is not from the Father, but is
from the world.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 John 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Another type of structure is the subjectivity complex.
This complex is built on emotionalism, human ability, and human guilt. Thus,
the foundation is self-love. The characteristics of the subjectivity complex
are found in 2 Timothy 3:1-4. 2 Tim. 3:1-7.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But realize this, that in the last days difficult times will
come. For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant,
revilers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy, unloving, irreconcilable,
malicious gossips, without self-control, brutal, haters of good, treacherous,
reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, holding to a
form of godliness, although they have denied its power; Avoid such men as
these. For among them are those who enter into households and captivate weak
women weighed down with sins, led on by various impulses, always learning and
never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Timothy 3:1-7,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A believer with a subjectivity complex has maximum
self-induced misery. They are never a good testimony. They need to use
confession of sin, start a daily intake of the Word, believe the Word by faith,
apply the Bible doctrine to life’s situations and decisions thereby replacing
the scar tissue with an edification complex of the soul. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Life’s Priorities</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Priority number one for edification must be perception, belief,
and application of the mystery doctrine for the Church Age. This demands
concentration under the ministry of the Holy Spirit in the spiritual life via
listening to, believing, and applying Bible doctrine taught by your
pastor-teacher using the grace apparatus for perception. This results in
spiritual growth that changes your thinking from human viewpoint to divine
viewpoint.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As you give Bible doctrine number one priority in your
life, you organize your life around priority Bible doctrine. Therefore, you
have an organized life which means you always give proper time to the
perception, belief, and application of doctrine. As you learn doctrine, your
thinking inevitably begins to change resulting in a progressive “renewing of
your mind.” Rom. 12:2.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by
the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that
which is good and acceptable and perfect.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 12:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Therefore, you begin to organize your thinking around
priority Bible doctrine. The more doctrine you learn, the more you organize
your thinking around doctrine. This maturing in the spiritual life means you more
often use application of the Bible doctrine in your soul to deal with problems
in life. As these doctrinal principles and capabilities are developed in your right
lobe, you concentrate on executing the plan of God for your life through the
doctrine you have learned. That is how you construct the edification complex of
the soul.</p>
