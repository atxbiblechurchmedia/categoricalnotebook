<h2><a name="_Conviction"></a>Conspiracy</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A conspiracy is a group of people trying to overthrow
duly constituted authority. It is a group of people suitably organized for an
evil or unlawful purpose. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Types of Conspiracy</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are six types of conspiracy according to the Word
of God. National conspiracy in Jeremiah 11:9. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD said to me, “A conspiracy has been found among
the men of Judah and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jeremiah
11:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Local conspiracy in Jeremiah 11:21-23. This was the
Anathoth conspiracy. This was Jeremiah’s home town. At one time, he was
extremely popular, but later the locals were out to get him. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the men of Anathoth,
who seek your life, saying, “Do not prophesy in the name of the LORD, so that
you will not die at our hand”; therefore, thus says the LORD of hosts, “Behold,
I am about to punish them! The young men will die by the sword, their sons and
daughters will die by famine; and a remnant will not be left to them, for I
will bring disaster on the men of Anathoth—the year of their punishment.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jeremiah
11:21-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Family conspiracy in Jeremiah 12:6.  </p>

<p class=Verses>““For even your brothers and the household of your father, Even
they have dealt treacherously with you, Even they have cried aloud after you.
Do not believe them, although they may say nice things to you.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jeremiah
12:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Personal conspiracy in Jeremiah 12:7.  </p>

<p class=Verses>““I have forsaken My house, I have abandoned My inheritance; I
have given the beloved of My soul Into the hand of her enemies.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jeremiah
12:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Religious conspiracy in Ezekiel 22:25-31. </p>

<p class=Verses>““There is a conspiracy of her prophets in her midst like a
roaring lion tearing the prey. They have devoured lives; they have taken
treasure and precious things; they have made many widows in the midst of her. “Her
priests have done violence to My law and have profaned My holy things; they
have made no distinction between the holy and the profane, and they have not
taught the difference between the unclean and the clean; and they hide their
eyes from My sabbaths, and I am profaned among them. “Her princes within her
are like wolves tearing the prey, by shedding blood and destroying lives in
order to get dishonest gain. “Her prophets have smeared whitewash for them,
seeing false visions and divining lies for them, saying, ‘Thus says the Lord
GOD,’ when the LORD has not spoken. “The people of the land have practiced
oppression and committed robbery, and they have wronged the poor and needy and
have oppressed the sojourner without justice. “I searched for a man among them
who would build up the wall and stand in the gap before Me for the land, so
that I would not destroy it; but I found no one. “Thus I have poured out My
indignation on them; I have consumed them with the fire of My wrath; their way
I have brought upon their heads,” declares the Lord GOD.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ezekiel
22:25-31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>International Conspiracy in Jeremiah 17:9-10. This is the
conspiracy of emotional revolt of the soul where the old sin nature in the
believer has a love affair with the emotions. The emotions in turn affect the
frontal lobe. A good illustration of this is the tongues movement. </p>

<p class=Verses>““The heart is more deceitful than all else And is desperately
sick; Who can understand it? “I, the LORD, search the heart, I test the mind,
Even to give to each man according to his ways, According to the results of his
deeds.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jeremiah 17:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Characteristics of Conspiracy</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A conspiracy has three organized categories – the plot,
the intrigue, and the machinations. The first category of a conspiracy is the
plot. A plot is a carefully devised plan for the overthrow of authority. It is
the most deliberate of all conspiracies. The plotters are the brains of the
conspiracy, sometimes in the background, but definitely the nerve center of all
conspiracies. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The second category of a conspiracy is intrigue and
involves dupes. This is a system of scheming involving petty and underhanded
methods. It also involves uninformed and unthinking people. This is usually the
type of conspiracy that accidentally falls together. People sit around at a
party and they begin to criticize. People talk over a dinner party and they
begin to criticize. Criticism spreads from one to another. They find they are
in agreement. This leads to intrigue. In Jeremiah 11:9, this involved the
inhabitants of Jerusalem. Dupes are people who have rejected the Word of God
and are in rebellion against duly constituted authority. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD said to me, “A conspiracy has been found among
the men of Judah and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jeremiah
11:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The third category of a conspiracy is machinations.
Machinations are the activity of those who are idle, troublemakers, and don’t
have much to do in life. These are groups who through a crafty and torturous
process seek to harass, destroy, and overthrow or harm establishment or
authority. This would involve organizations in a country that plot to undermine
and subvert the existing duly constituted authority that governs the nation.
This can involve those who destroy by hit and run violence.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The conditions that Jeremiah faced when he said in
Jeremiah 11:9, “A conspiracy has been found,” are exactly parallel to the
situation in the United States today. Jeremiah had already been the victim of a
personal conspiracy through his wife. He survived them all through Bible
doctrine giving iron to his soul.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the men of Anathoth,
who seek your life, saying, “Do not prophesy in the name of the LORD, so that
you will not die at our hand”; therefore, thus says the LORD of hosts, “Behold,
I am about to punish them! The young men will die by the sword, their sons and
daughters will die by famine; and a remnant will not be left to them, for I
will bring disaster on the men of Anathoth—the year of their punishment.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jeremiah
11:21-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There has never been a conspiracy or an apostacy without
first the rejection of Bible doctrine. Jer. 11:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“‘Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but walked, each
one, in the stubbornness of his evil heart; therefore I brought on them all the
words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they did not.’““&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jeremiah
11:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Jeremiah 11:8, “Yet, they did not obey” is the qal
perfect of  <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שׁמע</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (shâma‛) and is negative volition towards
Bible doctrine. “Nor incline their ear” is the niphil of <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>נטה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span>
(nâṭâh) and is stronger and means they had no concentration. It means they
knew they ought to come and hear Moses teach and they knew they ought to come
to Jeremiah’s Bible classes. They would come because they knew they should. It was
the thing to do. You ought to go to church once a week because if you don’t,
God will kick you in the pants. They feel better when they go to church. This a
salve of the conscience.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is how the conspiracy starts. I ought to go, but
there is a good program on TV tonight. I ought to go, but this is one of those
once in a lifetime parties. I ought to go, but I have some dear friends in
town. I ought to go, but…</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What does that mean? That means there is something more
important in your mind when Bible doctrine is communicated face-to-face. That
means you should already have warning bells going off in your soul. That means
your emotions demand titillation, stimulation, pleasure, or ecstatics. That
means your emotions are becoming so demanding they are about to rule your soul.
However, they will not rule until they get into a conspiracy with the old sin
nature! And when the old sin nature dominates the emotions, then the conspiracy
is on. They knew they should come and get Bible teaching, but there was
something to give them an excuse not to. And they would snatch at excuses! Like
straws!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Jeremiah 11:8, “But walked, each one, in the
stubbornness of his evil heart” refers to their life pattern, behavior and
thought pattern. The qal imperfect of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>הלך</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>(hâlak) means they kept on following this pattern. “Stubbornness” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שׁרירוּת</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(sherı̂yrûtha) and is a Hebrew term for
scar tissue and a technical word for the emotional revolt of the soul.
Emotional revolt makes the heart evil! </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Remember there are three categories of emotional revolt -
mental attitude sin revolt, lust type of revolt (power lust, approbation lust,
etc.), and human good revolt. One of these three or a combination work on the
emotions, which are responders only and have no doctrinal content.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An “evil heart” is a destroyed right lobe, like
Nebuchadnezzar in Daniel. “Evil” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>רַע</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (ra) and means
worthless. The heart is worthless because it has lost its authority. The day
that the pastor-teacher loses his authority to teach Bible doctrine in the
local church, he is worthless. The day that someone does not have authority in
a place of authority, that day he is worthless. The heart is the basic
authority of your soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When the police officer doesn’t have authority to arrest,
to shoot, to do whatever is necessary in line of duty, then the law enforcement
is worthless. When an officer in the military cannot command his troops, then
be becomes worthless. When you school teachers do not have authority over your
pupils, your teaching is worthless! When an executive in business cannot set
policy for that business, it becomes worthless! </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“All the words of this covenant” refers to those in
emotional revolt who will receive the cursing of the Mosaic Covenant. Deut.
27:15-26; Deut. 28: 15-48. </p>

<p class=Verses>“‘Cursed is the man who makes an idol or a molten image, an
abomination to the LORD, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and sets it up
in secret.’ And all the people shall answer and say, ‘Amen.’ ‘Cursed is he who
dishonors his father or mother.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’ ‘Cursed
is he who moves his neighbor’s boundary mark.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’
‘Cursed is he who misleads a blind person on the road.’ And all the people
shall say, ‘Amen.’ ‘Cursed is he who distorts the justice due an alien, orphan,
and widow.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’ ‘Cursed is he who lies with
his father’s wife, because he has uncovered his father’s skirt.’ And all the
people shall say, ‘Amen.’ ‘Cursed is he who lies with any animal.’ And all the
people shall say, ‘Amen.’ ‘Cursed is he who lies with his sister, the daughter
of his father or of his mother.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’ ‘Cursed
is he who lies with his mother-in-law.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’ ‘Cursed
is he who strikes his neighbor in secret.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’
‘Cursed is he who accepts a bribe to strike down an innocent person.’ And all
the people shall say, ‘Amen.’ ‘Cursed is he who does not confirm the words of
this law by doing them.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Deuteronomy
27:15-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Jeremiah 11:8, “commanded” is the piel perfect of <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>צוה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(tsâvâh) and is an intense type of
command from God, yet it was rejected. They chose cursing rather than blessing.
All conspiracies come out of the rejection of the authority of the pastor and
the rejection of Bible doctrine. Jer. 11:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD said to me, “A conspiracy has been found among
the men of Judah and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jeremiah
11:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>No one has a right to be a pastor unless he preaches with
authority, dogmatically, emphatically, and without deviation. And when he does,
obviously some will accept, some will reject. When they start going negative,
they get into emotional revolt of the soul and that’s it, the conspiracy is on!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Jeremiah 11:9, “Then the Lord said to me” refers to
Jeremiah. “A conspiracy” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>קשׁר</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (qesher) in the Hebrew and means a
combination of persons who are trying to overthrow duly constituted authority.
This word connotes the three areas of conspiracy.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Has been found” is the niphil perfect of <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>מצא</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> (mâtsâ’) meaning to discover. God permitted this conspiracy
to be uncovered and it became the basis of many of Jeremiah’s messages. “Among
the men of Judah” the men are the leaders of the conspiracy. They are in the
plot involving a few men. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Among the inhabitants of Jerusalem” is the intrigue
category. They are the dupes and pawns. They simply get into petty underhanded
comments back and forth. This is the larger group. These are the stupid ones
that parrot whatever comes out of the plotting.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Conspiracy Examples</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Conspiracy was the basis for one of the most tragic
revolutions of all time, the Absalom revolt. Absalom was the favorite son of
David. If ever a father loved his son, David loved Absalom. No one could hurt
David like Absalom could. 2 Sam. 15:12-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s
counselor, from his city Giloh, while he was offering the sacrifices. And the
conspiracy was strong, for the people increased continually with Absalom. Then
a messenger came to David, saying, “The hearts of the men of Israel are with
Absalom.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Samuel 15:12-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There was a plot, a carefully devised plan, but Absalom
was not in the plot. Then there was intrigue where Absalom became the dupe and
the front of the conspiracy. Then there were machinations, the crafty and
torturous tactics of Saul’s relatives who were still around. This makes quite a
study for conspiracy and how you can get drawn into this without even knowing
it. In fact, often people in the intrigue category and the machinations category
say, “There’s no organized conspiracy.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Conspiracy has been the basis of many assassinations such
as Joash in 2 Kings 12:19-21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now the rest of the acts of Joash and all that he did, are
they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? His
servants arose and made a conspiracy and struck down Joash at the house of
Millo as he was going down to Silla. For Jozacar the son of Shimeath and
Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, struck him and he died; and they
buried him with his fathers in the city of David, and Amaziah his son became
king in his place.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Kings 12:19-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Conspiracy was the basis for the assassination of the son
of Joash, Amaziah in 2 Kings 14:17-19 and 2 Chronicles 25:27. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived fifteen years
after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel. Now the rest of the
acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the
Kings of Judah? They conspired against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to
Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish and killed him there.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2
Kings 14:17-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“From the time that Amaziah turned away from following the LORD
they conspired against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish; but they sent
after him to Lachish and killed him there.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Chronicles 25:27,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is interesting when a conspiracy goes from one
generation to the next. The conspiracy in each generation reached a climax when
the target was liquidated. Again it involved all three categories.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Conspiracy destroyed the Northern Kingdom, among other
things. The last king of the Ten Northern Tribes was Hoshea. He came to the
throne through a conspiracy in 732 BC. 2 Kings 15:30. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the
son of Remaliah, and struck him and put him to death and became king in his
place, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Kings
15:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He loved conspiracy. He conspired against Assyria and as
such he was the last king of the Ten Northern Tribes and Assyria took them
captive under the Fifth Cycle of Discipline. 2 Kings 17:4-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea, who had
sent messengers to So king of Egypt and had offered no tribute to the king of
Assyria, as he had done year by year; so the king of Assyria shut him up and
bound him in prison. Then the king of Assyria invaded the whole land and went
up to Samaria and besieged it three years. In the ninth year of Hoshea, the
king of Assyria captured Samaria and carried Israel away into exile to Assyria,
and settled them in Halah and Habor, on the river of Gozan, and in the cities
of the Medes.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Kings 17:4-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jeremiah was the target of an organized conspiracy. This
conspiracy was based on the rejection of Bible doctrine. Jer. 11:9-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD said to me, “A conspiracy has been found among
the men of Judah and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem. “They have turned back
to the iniquities of their ancestors who refused to hear My words, and they
have gone after other gods to serve them; the house of Israel and the house of
Judah have broken My covenant which I made with their fathers.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jeremiah
11:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Religious conspiracy is the worst because it involves
every category of humanity. This is illustrated by Ezekiel in Ezekiel 22:25-31.</p>

<p class=Verses>““There is a conspiracy of her prophets in her midst like a
roaring lion tearing the prey. They have devoured lives; they have taken
treasure and precious things; they have made many widows in the midst of her. “Her
priests have done violence to My law and have profaned My holy things; they
have made no distinction between the holy and the profane, and they have not
taught the difference between the unclean and the clean; and they hide their
eyes from My sabbaths, and I am profaned among them. “Her princes within her
are like wolves tearing the prey, by shedding blood and destroying lives in
order to get dishonest gain. “Her prophets have smeared whitewash for them,
seeing false visions and divining lies for them, saying, ‘Thus says the Lord
GOD,’ when the LORD has not spoken. “The people of the land have practiced
oppression and committed robbery, and they have wronged the poor and needy and
have oppressed the sojourner without justice. “I searched for a man among them
who would build up the wall and stand in the gap before Me for the land, so
that I would not destroy it; but I found no one. “Thus I have poured out My
indignation on them; I have consumed them with the fire of My wrath; their way
I have brought upon their heads,” declares the Lord GOD.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ezekiel
22:25-31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Apostle Paul was a victim of conspiracy in Jerusalem.
The plot involved the Pharisees who were the legalists in the Sanhedrin. The
dupes were the 40 young men, knuckleheads who would not eat until Paul was
assassinated. The machinations involved the Judaizers who followed him around. Acts
23:12-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“When it was day, the Jews formed a conspiracy and bound
themselves under an oath, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until
they had killed Paul. There were more than forty who formed this plot.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts
23:12-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Cause of Conspiracy</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The cause of conspiracy is rejection of Bible doctrine
(Mosaic Law in the Old Testament). In Jeremiah 11:10, “iniquities of the
ancestors” refers to rejection of the Mosaic Law, specifically the golden calf
incident. The Jews came out of body slavery, but stayed in soul slavery. In 1441-1401
BC, all but Caleb, Joshua and Moses died in the desert under the sin unto death
for their continual negative volition. They would all die and never enter the Land
as their divine discipline from God. Then from soul slavery, they went back to
body slavery under the Chaldeans.</p>

<p class=Verses>““They have turned back to the iniquities of their ancestors
who refused to hear My words, and they have gone after other gods to serve
them; the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken My covenant which
I made with their fathers.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jeremiah 11:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When a nation reaches prosperity, it always does so
because of God’s grace, the laws which God has ordained, the principles of law
and order, privacy, the principle of authority, and the principle of free
enterprise.  But then they forget the grace of God and go into soul slavery and
lapse into body slavery. Whether we in the United States survive or not depends
upon our response to the Word of God.</p>
