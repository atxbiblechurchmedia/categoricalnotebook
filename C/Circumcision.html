<h2>Circumcision</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Circumcision was a sign and a seal. The true significance
of circumcision was not in its perpetuation, but in its institution.  First,
circumcision was a sign that salvation had already taken place - Abraham was
already saved. Then it was a seal. A seal indicates the validity of the thing
to which it is attached - salvation. The seal has no intrinsic value as it is
just wax with an imprint. Rom. 4:11-12.</p>

<p class=Verses> “and he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the
righteousness of the faith which he had while uncircumcised, so that he might
be the father of all who believe without being circumcised, that righteousness
might be credited to them, and the father of circumcision to those who not only
are of the circumcision, but who also follow in the steps of the faith of our
father Abraham which he had while uncircumcised.”  (Romans 4:11-12, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Circumcision was a seal attached to something valuable.
The seal is no good without the substance. The substance is salvation. Abraham’s
circumcision was the seal, just as water baptism is the seal today. When Paul
wrote this, the religious Jews had ignored the substance and had taken the seal
and tried to make it intrinsically valuable. They contended that salvation was
by circumcision, a ritual.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Circumcision was to Abraham what ritual (water) baptism
is to us in the Church Age, in that water baptism indicates that we have
already been saved by faith alone in the work of Jesus Christ alone.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The circumcision of the Jewish child on the 8th day from
birth was a ritual that the parents used to teach their children. The ritual
anticipated that the child would, in the future, accept the Messiah by faith,
to be their Savior. This ritual also indicated faith-rest on the part of the
parents as they anticipated that their child would be saved, in the future and
enjoy the unconditional covenants promised to Abraham and his seed.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Abraham was saved by faith long before he was
circumcised. Because Abraham was saved in status quo of uncircumcision, it
makes him the father (pattern) of all who believe, whether Jew or Gentile.
Since circumcision does not save, then salvation is not a Jewish monopoly in
the Old Testament.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Those who followed the pattern of Abraham (faith) were
saved and God’s perfect righteousness (+R) was imputed to them whether Jew or
Gentile. This excludes the Mosaic Law as a way of salvation, because the Mosaic
Law was given only to the Jews.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Circumcision’s Spiritual Significance </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>First Concept: The initial act of circumcision in the
human race involved Abraham. Gen. 17:8-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>““I will give to you and to your descendants after you, the
land of your sojournings, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting
possession; and I will be their God.” God said further to Abraham, “Now as for
you, you shall keep My covenant, you and your descendants after you throughout
their generations.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis 17:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This initial act of circumcision is identified with
possessing the land of Canaan by Abraham’s seed. Abraham separated himself unto
the Lord and the Lord’s promise. Circumcision in its initial activity was the
seal of faith in God’s promise, indicating that Abraham believed God’s Word.
Gen. 17:10-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>““This is My covenant, which you shall keep, between Me and you
and your descendants after you: every male among you shall be circumcised. “And
you shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin, and it shall be the
sign of the covenant between Me and you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis 17:10-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Second Concept: Circumcision of Abraham was a sign of
imputed righteousness. It is the sign that one has believed and is cleansed by
the blood and has been credited to their account God's very own perfect
righteousness (+R). Rom. 4:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the
righteousness of the faith which he had while uncircumcised, so that he might
be the father of all who believe without being circumcised, that righteousness
might be credited to them,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 4:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Third Concept: Circumcision is a picture of Retroactive
Positional Truth, identification with Christ in His death. Col. 2:11-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and in Him you were also circumcised with a circumcision made
without hands, in the removal of the body of the flesh by the circumcision of
Christ; having been buried with Him in baptism, in which you were also raised
up with Him through faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the dead.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Colossians
2:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There can be no victory in the Christian experience apart
from victory over the old sin nature. One phase of this victory is application
of Retroactive Positional Truth to experience. Rom<span dir=RTL></span><span
lang=HE dir=RTL><span dir=RTL></span>.</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> 6:1-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin so that
grace may increase? May it never be! How shall we who died to sin still live in
it? Or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus
have been baptized into His death? Therefore we have been buried with Him
through baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead through
the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life. For if we
have become united with Him in the likeness of His death, certainly we shall
also be in the likeness of His resurrection, knowing this, that our old self
was crucified with Him, in order that our body of sin might be done away with,
so that we would no longer be slaves to sin; for he who has died is freed from
sin. Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with
Him, knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, is never to die
again; death no longer is master over Him. For the death that He died, He died
to sin once for all; but the life that He lives, He lives to God. Even so
consider yourselves to be dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus.
Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its lusts,
and do not go on presenting the members of your body to sin as instruments of
unrighteousness; but present yourselves to God as those alive from the dead,
and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
6:1-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Fourth Concept: Circumcision was a sign of regeneration. Circumcision
was to the one who was born again in Israel what water baptism is to the one
who is born again in the Church Age. There was one exception. The 8th day
circumcision was a dedication on the part of the parents (no decision by the
child) that they would declare the message of the Christology of the Mosaic Law
to their children. They anticipated by faith that their children would become
believers.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Fifth Concept: Circumcision is a picture of confession of
sin. This is the principle of the circumcision at Gilgal. Confession of sin is
necessary for Christian service. Joshua 5:6-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the sons of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness,
until all the nation, that is, the men of war who came out of Egypt, perished
because they did not listen to the voice of the LORD, to whom the LORD had
sworn that He would not let them see the land which the LORD had sworn to their
fathers to give us, a land flowing with milk and honey. Their children whom He
raised up in their place, Joshua circumcised; for they were uncircumcised,
because they had not circumcised them along the way. Now when they had finished
circumcising all the nation, they remained in their places in the camp until
they were healed. Then the LORD said to Joshua, “Today I have rolled away the
reproach of Egypt from you.” So the name of that place is called Gilgal to this
day.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Joshua 5:6-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jericho fell because the children of Israel were in
fellowship and were operating in God’s grace provision. God did the doing, but
God’s grace must flow through a cleansed channel - because of confession of sin.
Joshua 5:13-15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now it came about when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted
up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man was standing opposite him with his
sword drawn in his hand, and Joshua went to him and said to him, “Are you for
us or for our adversaries?” He said, “No; rather I indeed come now as captain
of the host of the LORD.” And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and bowed
down, and said to him, “What has my lord to say to his servant?” The captain of
the LORD’S host said to Joshua, “Remove your sandals from your feet, for the
place where you are standing is holy.” And Joshua did so.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Joshua
5:13-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There could be no victory over Jericho until there was
victory over carnality. Circumcision denotes separation from the flesh. Today,
this is accomplished by use of 1 John 1:9, self-judgment.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
John 1:9, NASB)</p>
