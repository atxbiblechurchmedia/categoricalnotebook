<h2>Communion, Spiritual Self-Examination</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer is commanded to examine their spiritual
status prior to partaking of the bread and the cup in communion or the
Eucharist. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 11:28, “examine” is the present active
imperative of <span lang=EL>δοκιμα</span>́<span lang=EL>ζω</span> (dokimazō)
and means to test, to analyze, to examine. The imperative is a mandate or
command from our Lord. Believers are to examine themselves in view of being
approved to partake of communion. In other words, are you in fellowship? The
present tense indicates that the believer shouldn’t have to wait until
communion to do this spiritual self-examination. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But a man must examine himself, and in so doing he is to
eat of the bread and drink of the cup.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 11:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believer-priests are to judge themselves. In 1 Corinthians
11:31, “if we judged ourselves rightly” is the imperfect active indicative of <span
lang=EL>διακρι</span>́<span lang=EL>νω</span> (diakrinō) and means to discern,
doubt, judge, be partial. The believer-priest is to stay in fellowship. 1 Cor.
11:33-34.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But if we judged ourselves rightly, we would not be
judged.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 11:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So then, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait
for one another. If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, so that you will not
come together for judgment. The remaining matters I will arrange when I
come.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 11:33-34, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You must pass the test of being in fellowship before
partaking of communion. This is between you and the Lord. If you pass the
fellowship test via confession of known sin using 1 John 1:9, the believer is
also commanded to partake of the bread and the cup in communion. </p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
John 1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If you do not pass the test and do not use 1 John 1:9 to
ensure that you are in fellowship, “judge the body rightly” in 1 Corinthians
11:29, then partaking of communion out of fellowship will result in divine
discipline. This was a problem in the Corinthian church. 1 Cor. 11:30. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For he who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgment to
himself if he does not judge the body rightly.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians
11:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason many among you are weak and sick, and a number
sleep.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 11:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The word “weak” in 1 Corinthians 11:30 is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span
lang=EL>σθενη</span>́<span lang=EL>ς</span> (asthenēs) in the Greek and means
both a spiritual and physical weakness. The word “sick” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓́<span
lang=EL>ρ</span>̓<span lang=EL>ρ</span>̔<span lang=EL>ωστος</span> (arrhōstos)
in the Greek and means diseased or infirm. The phrase “a number sleep” refers
to physical death <span lang=EL>κοιμα</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (koimaō)
of a believer. Matt 14:14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“When He went ashore, He saw a large crowd, and felt compassion
for them and healed their sick.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 14:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Greek word <span lang=EL>δοκιμα</span>́<span lang=EL>ζω</span>
(dokimazō) was used in the secular sense to test the durability, purity,
temper, and worth of a metal.  In a practical sense, it’s used to mean to test,
to try or prove in the hope and expectation that the test will prove
successful, i.e. that the metal passes the test. The Greek word <i>dokimazō</i>
is used in the spiritual sense in the following ways.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Not passing a test in Romans 1:28 and 1 Corinthians 9:27.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any
longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do those things which are not
proper,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 1:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“but I discipline my body and make it my slave, so that, after
I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Corinthians 9:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Functioning under the grace apparatus for perception in
Romans 12:2. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by
the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that
which is good and acceptable and perfect.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 12:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Passing the fire test at the Judgment Seat of Christ in 1
Corinthians 3:13. </p>

<p class=Verses>“each man’s work will become evident; for the day will show it
because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire itself will test the
quality of each man’s work.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 3:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To prove the genuine character of the Corinthian’s love
in 2 Corinthians 8:8.</p>

<p class=Verses> “I am not speaking this as a command, but as proving through
the earnestness of others the sincerity of your love also.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2
Corinthians 8:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Regarding the ministry of Titus who was tried and proven
in 2 Corinthians 8:22. </p>

<p class=Verses>“We have sent with them our brother, whom we have often tested
and found diligent in many things, but now even more diligent because of his
great confidence in you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Corinthians 8:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For a man who is spiritually self-sustaining in Galatians
6:4. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But each one must examine his own work, and then he will have
reason for boasting in regard to himself alone, and not in regard to another.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Galatians
6:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For a believer passing application tests in Ephesians
5:10. </p>

<p class=Verses>“trying to learn what is pleasing to the Lord.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians
5:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Regarding the believer passing the spiritual testing that
cause the building up of the edification complex of the soul in Philippians
1:10.  Here, “excellent” refers to a spiritual maturity where there is a
completed edification complex in the believer’s soul. </p>

<p class=Verses>“so that you may approve the things that are excellent, in
order to be sincere and blameless until the day of Christ;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Philippians
1:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For the constant advantage of being tested spiritually in
1 Thessalonians 2:4. Here, “approved” means the believer is able to take bigger
responsibility in the angelic conflict as a result of God bringing these tests.
</p>

<p class=Verses>“but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with
the gospel, so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God who examines our hearts.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Thessalonians 2:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For a command to all believers to pass all the tests of
life because they have been given sufficient grace resources to handle the
test. 1 Thess. 5:21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But examine everything carefully; hold fast to that which is
good;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Thessalonians 5:21, NASB)</p>
