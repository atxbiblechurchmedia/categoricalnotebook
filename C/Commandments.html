<h2><a name="_Covenants:_Four_Unconditional"></a><a name="_The_Communicator"></a>Commandments</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Mosaic Law </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Mosaic Law contains has three parts that defined
God's policy for Israel – Codex One, Codex Two, and Codex Three. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Codex One is the Ten Commandments or Decalogue. This
defines freedom in terms of morality, privacy, property, and authority. 
Freedom is the basic heritage of a nation to God and is critical for the
function of evangelism, spiritual growth, and missionary outreach. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Codex Two contains the ordinances or the spiritual code.
The spiritual code includes the will and plan of God through ritual and oral
communication. This involved details of the sacred furniture, the structure of
the tabernacle and temple, the holy days, the function of the Levitical
priesthood, and the Levitical offerings.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Codex Three is called the judgments or establishment
code.  It is a compilation of the Laws Of Divine Establishment or the code for
civilization.  It was for both believers and unbelievers in Israel.  It
includes the Divine Institutions - freedom of self-determination (Volition), Marriage,
Family, and Nationalism.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It teaches the sanctity of life and property, freedom
through military victory, separation of the state from business, the profit
motive, and a system of tax laws (tithing). The judgments provide detail
regarding diet, health, sanitation, military training, criminal and civil law,
and capital punishment.  It also included a justice system for handling of
civil disputes, crimes, law enforcement, court trials with laws of evidence and
punishment.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Codex Three rejects Socialism, the welfare state, or any
implication that men are born equal.  Equal opportunity does not imply
equality. It also rejects civil disobedience, revolution in any form, the use
of violence against establishment authority, and anti-Semitism.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An overall characteristic of the Mosaic Law is
objectivity. There is no subjectivity in it nor sensitivity training. The
Mosaic Law and slavery are not compatible. Freedom is enhanced by the Mosaic
Law. People are free because of the grace of God. If you are going to enjoy
life, you must have norms and standards which also present a viewpoint of life.
This all tones up the frame of reference and enables you to have a capacity for
spiritual and temporal life. See the category on the <a href="#_Mosaic_Law">Mosaic
Law</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Codex One - The Ten Commandments</b> </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Ten Commandments were written by God on two stone tablets
and then given to Moses on Mount Sinai. The record of the Ten Commandments can
be found in Exodus 20:2-17 and Deuteronomy 5:6-21.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The First Commandment:</u> Exodus 20:3. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The first commandment deals with worship of only The God
to the absolute exclusion of other gods. There are many religions that worship
other gods. The first commandment also prohibits mental or soul idolatry. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;You shall have no other gods before Me.&quot; 
(Exodus 20:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Second Commandment:</u> Exodus 20:4-6. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The second commandment deals with idols or objects that
depict other gods (any likeness) to which people may render overt worship. This
includes idols such as the golden calf of the Exodus, statues of God or Christ
and “any likeness of what is in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the
water under the earth” which includes worshipping fish, oxen, the cow, or any
animal or bird or sea life. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;You shall not make for yourself an idol, or any
likeness of what is in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the water
under the earth. &quot;You shall not worship them or serve them; for I, the
LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the
children, on the third and the fourth generations of those who hate Me, but
showing lovingkindness to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My
commandments.&quot;  (Exodus 20:4-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Exodus 20:5, “serve them” refers to providing
sacrifices (animal), food, clothing, human sacrifices, and entering into the
sexual activities of the Phallic Cult. “Am a jealous God” is an anthropopathism
that conveys God the Father’s policy of forbidding idolatry in any form. This
was for the protection of Israel and to keep the nation from moral and immoral
degeneracy. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Iniquity of the fathers” means that negative volition
cannot be perpetuated past four generations. If so, divine discipline escalates
to include death of the family line, war, famine, pestilence and the many forms
of the five cycles of divine discipline on a nation that opposes God and turns
away from His mandates. In Jeremiah’s day, negative volition for two
generations resulted in the Fifth Cycle of Discipline. Exodus 20:6 shows the
positive side of this commandment to them that have positive volition toward
God and His commandments. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Overt idolatry is said to be contact with demons which
destroys human freedom and ultimately the nation. 1 Cor. 10:19-21; Isaiah 2:8;
Ezek. 6:4-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“What do I mean then? That a thing sacrificed to idols is
anything, or that an idol is anything? No, but I say that the things which the
Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God; and I do not want
you to become sharers in demons. You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the
cup of demons; you cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of
demons.” (1 Corinthians 10:19-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Their land has also been filled with idols; They worship the
work of their hands, That which their fingers have made.” (Isaiah 2:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;So your altars will become desolate and your incense
altars will be smashed; and I will make your slain fall in front of your idols.
&quot;I will also lay the dead bodies of the sons of Israel in front of their
idols; and I will scatter your bones around your altars. &quot;In all your
dwellings, cities will become waste and the high places will be desolate, that
your altars may become waste and desolate, your idols may be broken and brought
to an end, your incense altars may be cut down, and your works may be blotted
out.” (Ezekiel 6:4-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Third Commandment:</u> Exodus 20:7.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The third commandment means to take an oath using the
name of God such as; “as God is my witness, such and such happened” or to use
God’s name to cover your lies. You can try to coerce some girl to marry you by
saying, “It’s God’s will or the Lord led me to you.” </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in
vain, for the LORD will not leave him unpunished who takes His name in
vain.&quot;  (Exodus 20:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“You shall not take” is the qal imperfect of <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>נשׂא</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(nâśâ') plus the negative is used as a
prohibition. Translation, you shall not lift up the voice. “In vain” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שׁוא</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(shâv') and means for an evil purpose,
for vanity, for a false purpose, for worthlessness. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This commandment prohibits the use of God’s name for vain
and unworthy objects including false testimony in the name of God in a court of
law and false swearing in any phase of life like, “as God is my witness.” You
are either telling the truth or lying. Don’t bring God into it either way!
Other examples include “so help me God” or in most instances, “God willing” or
“God strike me dead.” These false oaths are often connected with an
exaggeration or a half-lie with the intention to deceive. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Therefore, this commandment prohibits using the name of
God to cover a lie, attaching God’s will or God’s name to some project which
you want to get through. God’s name is rightly used in prayer, praise,
thanksgiving, unconditional love toward others, and doctrinal communication.
God’s name is not to be used in profanity, lying, hate, or bullying a
congregation to take a course of action. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Decalogue is designed to defend human liberty and
freedom. “Will not leave him unpunished” is the piel imperfect of <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>נקה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(nâqâh) and means that the Lord will not
acquit him. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Fourth Commandment</u>: Exodus 20:8-10.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Jewish Age, Saturday provided freedom. In the
Church Age, Sunday provides freedom. In Exodus 20:8, “Remember” is the qal
infinitive absolute of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>זכר</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(zâkar) and refers
to the frame of reference and memory center in the right lobe of the soul and
means to think Bible doctrine.  “Sabbath” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שׁבּת</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(shabbâth) and is taken from the verb “to
rest.” “To keep it holy” is the piel infinitive of <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>קדשׁ</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(qâdash) and means to set apart, to consecrate, to do
something on that day they didn’t do on other days - to rest. This means a
complete relaxation day. See category on <a href="#_The_Sabbath">The Sabbath</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.
&quot;Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a
sabbath of the LORD your God; in it you shall not do any work, you or your son
or your daughter, your male or your female servant or your cattle or your
sojourner who stays with you.&quot;  (Exodus 20:8-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Sabbath also recognizes that people who work for a
living have to have time to rest. People need to rest to get ready for the next
week. Without some rest, you become a slave to your job. You need opportunity
to exercise your freedom and personal volition outside the workplace. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Fifth Commandment:</u> Exodus 20:12.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fifth commandment establishes authority early in
everyone’s life. The first authority in life is that of your parents. The fifth
commandment says honor not love. It is more important for children to recognize
the authority of their parents than to love them. Love will follow later in
life. Many a young person has gone back to their parents and said, “I want to
thank you for not letting me run loose. I want to thank you for not letting me
date at 16 when I was so stupid. Thank you for keeping me from doing various
things when everyone else did. Thank you for putting your foot down.”</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Honor your father and your mother, that your days
may be prolonged in the land which the LORD your God gives you.&quot;  (Exodus
20:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Honor means to recognize and orient to the authority of
parents. Children who honor their parents in childhood and teenage years will
live a longer life. See category on <a href="#_Authority_Orientation">Authority
Orientation</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Sixth Commandment:</u> Exodus 20:13.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The sixth commandment has to do with crime. God forbids
murder, the unlawful taking of human life in private vengeance or otherwise.
Murder is the basic violation of human freedom. People should live under the
principle of “live and let live.” Killing is bona fide in justified warfare.
Killing is bona fide in capital punishment. Killing is bona fide in protection
of life, limb and protection of property in defense against criminals. See
category on <a href="#_D-Murder">Murder</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;You shall not murder.&quot;  (Exodus 20:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Seventh Commandment:</u> Exodus 20:14.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The seventh commandment deals with the sanctity of sex
only within marriage of a man and his woman. Acceptance of sexual intercourse
outside of marriage is a good indicator of the level of moral degeneracy of a
society and a nation. Our Lord reminded us in Matthew 5:27-30 that the marriage
sexual relationship must be guarded diligently. See category on <a
href="#_D-Marriage,_Sex_in">Marriage, Sex in Marriage</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You shall not commit adultery.” (Exodus 20:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;You have heard that it was said, 'YOU SHALL NOT
COMMIT ADULTERY'; but I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust
for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. &quot;If your
right eye makes you stumble, tear it out and throw it from you; for it is
better for you to lose one of the parts of your body, than for your whole body
to be thrown into hell. &quot;If your right hand makes you stumble, cut it off
and throw it from you; for it is better for you to lose one of the parts of
your body, than for your whole body to go into hell.&quot;  (Matthew 5:27-30,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Adultery is both a sin and an attack on human freedom.
Capacity for love and life is distorted and ruined, so that adultery not only
abuses freedom, but destroys the possibility for happiness in life. A greater
regard for the sanctity of marriage is needed today. Marriage vows are under
attack today and many say they are not needed anymore and that marriage is
outmoded. The Word of God says otherwise! </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Eighth Commandment:</u> Exodus 20:15.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The eighth commandment emphasizes the right of private
property and forbids theft or stealing that which you do not own. Theft has
negative consequences in most societies. Where theft is allowed or such laws
are not enforced, societal degeneracy results and freedom of property ownership
is lost. Instead, we are to be content with what we have and trust God to
supply all our needs in Christ Jesus. 1 Tim. 6:6; Phil. 4:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;You shall not steal.&quot;  (Exodus 20:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But godliness actually is a means of great gain when
accompanied by contentment.&quot;  (1 Timothy 6:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And my God will supply all your needs according to His
riches in glory in Christ Jesus.&quot;  (Philippians 4:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Ninth Commandment:</u> Exodus 20:16.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The ninth commandment emphasizes the protection of human
freedom through objectivity in the function of the law. This commandment
forbids the sins of libel, slander, deceit, and calls for the truth and nothing
but the truth. The laws of evidence demand truth in courtroom testimony.
Hearsay is not admissible as testimony.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;You shall not bear false witness against your
neighbor.&quot;  (Exodus 20:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The ninth commandment forbids bribery and forgery and
even the least suggestion contrary to truth. Such false witness is the most
damaging in a court of law where false information is given or critical
information is withheld to sway the outcome of the court’s decision. A nation
and a society must function based on the rule of law. It cannot function properly
with unchecked perjury, gossip and maligning.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Tenth Commandment:</u> Exodus 20:17.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The tenth commandment deals with desiring or coveting
that which is not yours. This includes the possessions of others in all forms.
“Covet” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>חמד</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(châmad) and means
to desire, to take pleasure in, to find delectable, to lust after.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you
shall not covet your neighbor's wife or his male servant or his female servant
or his ox or his donkey or anything that belongs to your neighbor.&quot;&quot; 
(Exodus 20:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has promised to meet all our needs, both spiritual
and physical with His grace resources in the spiritual life. Bible doctrine in
the soul produces a contentment with what God has provided. Phil. 4:19; Matt.
6:33; Heb. 13:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And my God will supply all your needs according to His
riches in glory in Christ Jesus.&quot;  (Philippians 4:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness,
and all these things will be added to you.&quot;  (Matthew 6:33, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Make sure that your character is free from the love of
money, being content with what you have; for He Himself has said, &quot;I WILL
NEVER DESERT YOU, NOR WILL I EVER FORSAKE YOU,&quot;&quot;  (Hebrews 13:5,
NASB)</p>
