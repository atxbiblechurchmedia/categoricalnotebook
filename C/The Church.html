<h2><a name="_D-The_Church"></a><a name="_The_Church"></a>The Church</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Beginning of the Church</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Church began on the Day of Pentecost. John 14:16-20
gives a picture of the Church Age relationships with the Holy Spirit and with
the Lord Jesus Christ. Christ is absent during the Church Age and the Holy
Spirit produces His character in spiritually mature believers.</p>

<p class=Verses>““I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Helper,
that He may be with you forever; that is the Spirit of truth, whom the world
cannot receive, because it does not see Him or know Him, but you know Him
because He abides with you and will be in you. “I will not leave you as
orphans; I will come to you. “After a little while the world will no longer see
Me, but you will see Me; because I live, you will live also. “In that day you
will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John
14:16-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Acts 1:5, Acts 11:15, and John 14:20 say the Baptism of
the Holy Spirit happened on the Day of Pentecost which was the beginning of the
Church Age. In the Church Age, the Baptism of the Holy Spirit occurs at the
point of salvation for all believers. It is the Holy Spirit placing every
believer into union with Jesus Christ at the point of salvation.  All Church
Age believers form the Body of Christ. We are placed “in Christ.” At salvation,
the Holy Spirit identifies the individual with the Body of Christ. The term “baptism”
means to identify. </p>

<p class=Verses>“for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with
the Holy Spirit not many days from now.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 1:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them just
as He did upon us at the beginning.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 11:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in
Me, and I in you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 14:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 Corinthians 12:13 says that the Body of Christ is the
Church universal. The Church started in only one local spot in Jerusalem. After
only 30 years, the Church had covered the known world.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether
Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one
Spirit.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 12:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Jewish Age believers were indwelt by the Holy Spirit
on the Day of Pentecost and baptized by the Holy Spirit into the Body of
Christ. They then preached the Gospel to the “devout” Jews, (not saved) present
for the Passover feast. Acts 2:3-5; 2 Cor. 5:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And there appeared to them tongues as of fire distributing
themselves, and they rested on each one of them. And they were all filled with
the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit was giving
them utterance. Now there were Jews living in Jerusalem, devout men from every
nation under heaven.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 2:3-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creature;
the old things passed away; behold, new things have come.&quot;  (2 Corinthians
5:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At that point just as today when someone is born again,
they are filled with the Holy Spirit and are then in fellowship with the Lord.
Those Jewish Age believers also received at least one spiritual gift. For
example in Acts 2:4, the gift of tongues.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to
speak with other tongues, as the Spirit was giving them utterance.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts
2:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“When the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in
one place. And suddenly there came from heaven a noise like a violent rushing
wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. And there appeared
to them tongues as of fire distributing themselves, and they rested on each one
of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with
other tongues, as the Spirit was giving them utterance.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts
2:1-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the time of their belief in Jesus Christ before the
Day of Pentecost, they already had been regenerated and sealed by the Holy
Spirit. Now, they are the Church and have received the same seven things from
the Holy Spirit that every born-again believer receives in the Church Age. See
category on the <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/H/Holy%20Spirit%2C%20Seven%20Salvation%20Ministries.html">Holy Spirit, Seven Salvation
Ministries.</a></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 19:1-7, Jewish Age believers were placed into the
Body of Christ through the Baptism of the Holy Spirit. </p>

<p class=Verses>“It happened that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed
through the upper country and came to Ephesus, and found some disciples. He
said to them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?” And they
said to him, “No, we have not even heard whether there is a Holy Spirit.” And
he said, “Into what then were you baptized?” And they said, “Into John’s
baptism.” Paul said, “John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the
people to believe in Him who was coming after him, that is, in Jesus.” When
they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. And when
Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they began
speaking with tongues and prophesying. There were in all about twelve men.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts
19:1-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Mystery</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The doctrine of the Mystery in mentioned in Ephesians
3:3-6. In Ephesians 3:3 is the revelation of the mystery. In Ephesians 3:4 is
the knowledge of the mystery. In Ephesians 3:5 is the definition of the
mystery. In Ephesians 3:6 is the content of the mystery. </p>

<p class=Verses>“that by revelation there was made known to me the mystery, as
I wrote before in brief. By referring to this, when you read you can understand
my insight into the mystery of Christ, which in other generations was not made
known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and
prophets in the Spirit; to be specific, that the Gentiles are fellow heirs and
fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus
through the gospel,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 3:3-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Up until the time of our Lord’s ministry on earth, the
Church was a complete mystery. The “Church” did not exist in the Old Testament,
nor was it revealed in the Old Testament. In Ephesians 3:1-10, “mystery” is <span
lang=EL>μυστη</span>́<span lang=EL>ριον</span> (mustērion) in the Greek and means
to be known to those on the inside and not to those on the outside. The mystery
is the New Testament and has reference to Church Age truth. The Church Age was
prophesied in the New Testament by Jesus Christ in Matthew 16:18 and John
14:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“that by revelation there was made known to me the mystery, as
I wrote before in brief. By referring to this, when you read you can understand
my insight into the mystery of Christ, which in other generations was not made
known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and
prophets in the Spirit;” (Ephesians 3:3-5, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“To me, the very least of all saints, this grace was given, to
preach to the Gentiles the unfathomable riches of Christ, and to bring to light
what is the administration of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God
who created all things; so that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made
known through the church to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly
places.” (Ephesians 3:8-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I
will build My church; and the gates of Hades will not overpower it.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew
16:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in
Me, and I in you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 14:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This doctrine refers to the Old Testament and Gospels
where the “Church” could be mentioned but isn’t. This passage approaches the
Church Age (death, burial, resurrection, ascension) and then stops. If the
passage has any more to say, it skips the Church Age and goes into the
Tribulation, Millennium, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Church Age (mystery) was not mentioned in the Old
Testament or in the Gospels other than in Matthew 16:18 and John 13-17 in our
Lord’s Upper Room Discourse. Eph. 3:5. In Matt. 16:18, the Church is still
future.</p>

<p class=Verses>“which in other generations was not made known to the sons of
men, as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in the
Spirit;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 3:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses> ““I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I
will build My church; and the gates of Hades will not overpower it.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew
16:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Holy Spirit takes the believer at the point of
salvation and enters them into Union with Christ. This only happens in the
Church Age. The Baptism of the Holy Spirit actually began on the Day of
Pentecost, although it is not mentioned until Acts 11:15 as “us at the
beginning” referring to the apostles on the Day of Pentecost and in Acts 11:16
which quotes Acts 1:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>““And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them just
as He did upon us at the beginning.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 11:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““And I remembered the word of the Lord, how He used to say, ‘John
baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.’“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts
11:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with
the Holy Spirit not many days from now.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 1:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The crucifixion, death, resurrection and ascension of
Jesus Christ took place during the Age of Israel or the Jewish Age. The Church
Age began on the Day of Pentecost. The Church Age is called the “stewardship of
God’s grace” in Ephesians 3:2-3. This is because a maximum amount of grace is
available to Church Age believers. For example, the Jews had failed in their
responsibility, but the Jews were the first believers and were made part of the
“Church.”</p>

<p class=Verses>“if indeed you have heard of the stewardship of God’s grace
which was given to me for you; that by revelation there was made known to me
the mystery, as I wrote before in brief.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 3:2-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Invisible Church</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Greek word for “Church” is <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span
lang=EL>κκλησι</span>́<span lang=EL>α</span> (ekklesia) and means that which is
called out. Up until the time of our Lord’s ministry on earth, the Church was a
complete mystery.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Church universal (and invisible in the true biblical
sense) is made up of both Jew and Gentile who accept the Lord Jesus Christ as
their Savior. From the moment of regeneration, they cease to be Jew or Gentile
and become members of the Church. Gal. 3:26-28; Col. 3:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. For
all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.
There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is
neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Galatians
3:26-28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“a renewal in which there is no distinction between Greek and
Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave and freeman, but
Christ is all, and in all.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Colossians 3:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 12:12, the Church is called the Body of
Christ with many members. Rom. 12:4-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For even as the body is one and yet has many members, and all
the members of the body, though they are many, are one body, so also is Christ.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Corinthians 12:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For just as we have many members in one body and all the
members do not have the same function, so we, who are many, are one body in
Christ, and individually members one of another.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 12:4-5,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the point of salvation, the Holy Spirit baptizes all
believers into the Body of Christ. 1 Cor. 12:13. In Colossians 1:18, Christ is
designated as the head of the body, the Church.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether
Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one
Spirit.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 12:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He is also head of the body, the church; and He is the
beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that He Himself will come to have
first place in everything.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Colossians 1:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Church is the Lord’s redeemed called from the old
creation (in Adam) into Christ. 1 Cor. 15:22; 2 Cor. 5:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made
alive.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 15:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creature; the
old things passed away; behold, new things have come.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2
Corinthians 5:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Church is likened to a growing, but not yet completed
structure. Eph. 2:21-22; 1 Cor. 3:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“in whom the whole building, being fitted together, is growing
into a holy temple in the Lord, in whom you also are being built together into
a dwelling of God in the Spirit.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 2:21-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s field, God’s
building.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 3:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Through the production of the filling Holy Spirit,
Christ’s character is formed in the Church Age believer. The Spirit’s fruit is
produced in the believer. The believer is conformed to His image. Gal. 4:19;
Gal. 5:22-23; Rom. 8:28-29.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;My children, with whom I am again in labor until Christ
is formed in you—&quot;  (Galatians 4:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,
patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against
such things there is no law.&quot;  (Galatians 5:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And we know that God causes all things to work together
for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His
purpose. For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to
the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many
brethren;&quot;  (Romans 8:28-29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When the last believer has been added to the Church, the
Lord will remove His Church from the earth at the Rapture. John 14:3; 1 Thess.
4:13-17; Eph. 5:27.</p>

<p class=Verses>““If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and
receive you to Myself, that where I am, there you may be also.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John
14:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But we do not want you to be uninformed, brethren, about those
who are asleep, so that you will not grieve as do the rest who have no hope.
For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with
Him those who have fallen asleep in Jesus. For this we say to you by the word
of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord,
will not precede those who have fallen asleep. For the Lord Himself will
descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the
trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive
and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord
in the air, and so we shall always be with the Lord.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Thessalonians 4:13-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“that He might present to Himself the church in all her glory,
having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that she would be holy and
blameless.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 5:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Lord Himself builds His church. Matt. 16:18; Acts
2:47.</p>

<p class=Verses>““I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I
will build My church; and the gates of Hades will not overpower it.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew
16:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“praising God and having favor with all the people. And the
Lord was adding to their number day by day those who were being saved.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts
2:47, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Church when in heaven will be called the “Bride of
Christ.” Rev. 19:6-8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then I heard something like the voice of a great multitude and
like the sound of many waters and like the sound of mighty peals of thunder,
saying, “Hallelujah! For the Lord our God, the Almighty, reigns. “Let us
rejoice and be glad and give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb has
come and His bride has made herself ready.” It was given to her to clothe
herself in fine linen, bright and clean; for the fine linen is the righteous
acts of the saints.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation 19:6-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Other words used for the Church are; Position in Christ,
In Christ, Body of Christ, Church Universal, Church Invisible, and Bride of
Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><a name="_The_Church,_General"></a><b>Construction of The
Church </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Although God saw fit not to make known this mystery prior
to the Church Age, He had planned the Church and the believing members of it
before the foundation of the world. Eph. 1:4. </p>

<p class=Verses>“just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world,
that we would be holy and blameless before Him. In love”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians
1:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The structure of the Church could not begin until after
the Lord Jesus Christ had died, risen and ascended to the third heaven and was
seated at the right hand of God the Father. The Church is called the “Body of
Christ” in Ephesians 1:22-23. Christ is the head of the body or the Church.
Col. 1:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He put all things in subjection under His feet, and gave
Him as head over all things to the church, which is His body, the fullness of
Him who fills all in all.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 1:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He is also head of the body, the church; and He is the
beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that He Himself will come to have
first place in everything.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Colossians 1:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The construction of the Church is given in Ephesians
2:19-22. The founder of the Church is Jesus Christ (Eph. 2:20b) who is the
Chief Cornerstone. Jesus Christ has always been the only source of salvation
for the Church Age and all previous dispensations. Jesus Christ brings Jew and
Gentile together in Christ in the Church Age.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are
fellow citizens with the saints, and are of God’s household, having been built
on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the
corner stone, in whom the whole building, being fitted together, is growing
into a holy temple in the Lord, in whom you also are being built together into
a dwelling of God in the Spirit.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians 2:19-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The historical foundation of the Church is the Church Age
spiritual gifts of apostleship and prophecy, which were possessed by the early
church leaders and historical founders of the Church. Eph. 2:20; Matt. 16:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“having been built on the foundation of the apostles and
prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the corner stone,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians
2:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I
will build My church; and the gates of Hades will not overpower it.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew
16:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The meaning of the name “Peter” (his new name) was “the
little rock” or “a little chip off of a big rock.” Peter understood that he was
exactly like any other believer - a small living stone which, when fitted
together, made up the Church or Body of Christ. Peter understood that he was
not “the rock” on which the Lord’s Church would be built, but that Christ was
the foundation of the Church. 1 Peter 2:4-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And coming to Him as to a living stone which has been rejected
by men, but is choice and precious in the sight of God, you also, as living
stones, are being built up as a spiritual house for a holy priesthood, to offer
up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. For this is
contained in Scripture: “BEHOLD, I LAY IN ZION A CHOICE STONE, A PRECIOUS
CORNER stone, AND HE WHO BELIEVES IN HIM WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.” This
precious value, then, is for you who believe; but for those who disbelieve, “THE
STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS REJECTED, THIS BECAME THE VERY CORNER stone,” and, “A
STONE OF STUMBLING AND A ROCK OF OFFENSE”; for they stumble because they are
disobedient to the word, and to this doom they were also appointed. But you are
A CHOSEN RACE, A royal PRIESTHOOD, A HOLY NATION, A PEOPLE FOR God’s OWN
POSSESSION, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you
out of darkness into His marvelous light;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Peter 2:4-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is the Rock. A rock is hard, solid, safe and
sturdy foundation on which to put up a building of any size. You would not
erect a building on a pebble. All believers in this dispensation are considered
“living stones” who are “acceptable to Jesus Christ.” 1 Cor. 10:4; Psalms
18:31.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and all drank the same spiritual drink, for they were drinking
from a spiritual rock which followed them; and the rock was Christ.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Corinthians 10:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For who is God, but the LORD? And who is a rock, except our
God,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 18:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 16:18-19, the phrase “I will build My church”
is a future event. The phrase “keys of the kingdom of heaven” means the
prerogative of witnessing that would bring new believers to the Body of Christ
or the Church.</p>

<p class=Verses>““I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I
will build My church; and the gates of Hades will not overpower it. “I will
give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever you bind on earth
shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall have
been loosed in heaven.”“  (Matthew 16:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The growth of the “building” in Ephesians 2:21 refers to
each new believer being added to the Body of Christ by the Baptism of the Holy
Spirit. 1 Cor. 12:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“in whom the whole building, being fitted together, is growing
into a holy temple in the Lord,”  (Ephesians 2:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For even as the body is one and yet has many members, and all
the members of the body, though they are many, are one body, so also is
Christ.”  (1 Corinthians 12:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Holy Spirit holds this Church together. Within each
individual believer there should be built an edification complex in their soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Jewish Age Believers Become Members of The Church </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Jewish Aage believers were made Church Age believers
at Ephesus. This is just one illustration of the transition. In Acts 19:1,
“some disciples” were Jewish Age believers.</p>

<p class=Verses>“It happened that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed
through the upper country and came to Ephesus, and found some disciples.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts
19:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 19:2, Paul is determining whether they are Old
Testament or New Testament believers.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He said to them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you
believed?” And they said to him, “No, we have not even heard whether there is a
Holy Spirit.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 19:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 19:3, “Into what” means on what basis. “Into
John’s baptism” confirms the fact that they were Jewish Age believers. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And he said, “Into what then were you baptized?” And they
said, “Into John’s baptism.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 19:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 19:4, “repentance” means a complete change of
mental attitude concerning Jesus Christ. You do not repent of your sins. The
object of the verb “to repent” is Jesus Christ. It is a synonym of belief. The
word “repent” does not include any reference to “sorrow for sin.” Repent is
simply the mental attitude you have toward Jesus Christ when you believe in His
work for your sins on the Cross. When you believe, you repent. When you repent,
you believe.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Paul said, “John baptized with the baptism of repentance,
telling the people to believe in Him who was coming after him, that is, in
Jesus.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 19:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 19:5, “were baptized” is in the aorist tense and
means a point of time. “In the name” means into the person of the Lord Jesus
Christ. This is referring to the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, which entered them
into union with Christ.</p>

<p class=Verses>“When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the
Lord Jesus.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 19:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>These Old Testament Jewish believers could not have Positional
Truth without the death, burial, resurrection and ascension of our Lord Jesus
Christ. Christ had not died in the Old Testament (historically) therefore,
there was no Baptism of the Holy Spirit in the Old Testament. John 7:37-39.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood
and cried out, saying, “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink. “He
who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, ‘From his innermost being will flow
rivers of living water.’“ But this He spoke of the Spirit, whom those who
believed in Him were to receive; for the Spirit was not yet given, because
Jesus was not yet glorified.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 7:37-39, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 19:6, “laid his hands upon them” means to show
that Paul was identified with them. The phrase “speaking with tongues” meant to
show they were identified with Pentecost.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit
came on them, and they began speaking with tongues and prophesying.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts
19:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Within one generation, the Age of Israel believers became
Church Age believers in union with Christ. Christianity has already spread
throughout the inhabited world.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Team Concept of the Church</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Lord Jesus Christ is absent from the earth, seated at
the right hand of the Father. Every believer represents Him. 2 Cor. 5:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were
making an appeal through us; we beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to
God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Corinthians 5:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every believer is part of the Body of Christ, in union
with Christ. 1 Cor. 12:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether
Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one
Spirit.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 12:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Because we in union with Christ the Holy Spirit has
sovereignly bestowed upon us at least one spiritual gift. 1 Cor. 12:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But one and the same Spirit works all these things,
distributing to each one individually just as He wills.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Corinthians 12:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The different parts of the body are analogous to
spiritual gifts. 1 Cor. 12:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For even as the body is one and yet has many members, and all
the members of the body, though they are many, are one body, so also is Christ.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Corinthians 12:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual gifts determine the believer’s position on the
team or the Body of Christ. All spiritual gifts depend upon the filling of the
Holy Spirit for operation and resulting divine production. The filling of the
Holy Spirit is more important than any spiritual gift. 1 Cor. 12.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Christian way of life, all authority and
responsibility is based upon spiritual birth and the sovereign bestowal of
spiritual gifts by the Holy Spirit. For maximum divine production from your
spiritual gift, you need the filling of the Holy Spirit plus Bible doctrine in
the right lobe of your soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every Church Age believer has at least one spiritual
gift. It is to the advantage of the Body of Christ to have all spiritual gifts
operational. One of the great factors of a local church is the consistent
function of believers in fellowship functioning in service through the area of
their spiritual gift.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What you do in the Christian life in way of service
depends upon your spiritual gift, plus knowing the techniques and growing up
spiritually resulting in the development of the edification complex in the soul.
We all have the same position in Christ, but while living on earth, we have
different spiritual gifts. Some gifts carry more authority than others.
Distinction of gifts does not in any way make you inferior or superior. Each
gift determines the believer’s responsibilities in the plan of God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><a name="_A_Categorical_and"></a><b>The Relation of the
Church to Government</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the New Testament, the Church is instructed to pray
for governmental authorities, since they are appointed by God. 1 Tim 2:1-4. The
Church is further instructed to be in subjection to such powers in 1 Peter
2:13-16, Titus 3:1, and Romans 13:1-7 because these governments are God’s
representatives to carry out God’s will.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;First of all, then, I urge that entreaties and prayers,
petitions and thanksgivings, be made on behalf of all men, for kings and all
who are in authority, so that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all
godliness and dignity. This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our
Savior, who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the
truth.&quot;  (1 Timothy 2:1-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every human
institution, whether to a king as the one in authority, or to governors as sent
by him for the punishment of evildoers and the praise of those who do right.
For such is the will of God that by doing right you may silence the ignorance
of foolish men. Act as free men, and do not use your freedom as a covering for
evil, but use it as bondslaves of God.&quot;  (1 Peter 2:13-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Remind them to be subject to rulers, to authorities, to
be obedient, to be ready for every good deed,&quot;  (Titus 3:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>During the Tribulation, the governments will be
controlled by Satan because the restraining ministry of God the Holy Spirit
will have been removed. The Church must be delivered before this time for it
could not be subject to such a government. Rev. 13:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;they worshiped the dragon because he gave his authority
to the beast; and they worshiped the beast, saying, &quot;Who is like the
beast, and who is able to wage war with him?&quot;&quot;  (Revelation 13:4,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is silence concerning the Tribulation in the
Epistles. Much instruction is given concerning trials and tribulations, but
none of the nature mentioned in Revelation 6-19.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Regarding the sealing of the 144,000 Jews in Revelation 7
and Revelation 14, as long as the Church is on earth, none are saved to a
special Jewish relationship. All who are saved are placed in a positional
relationship with Christ. Col. 1:26-29; Col. 3:11; Eph. 2:14-22; Eph. 3:1-7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;that is, the mystery which has been hidden from the past
ages and generations, but has now been manifested to His saints, to whom God
willed to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the
Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. We proclaim Him,
admonishing every man and teaching every man with all wisdom, so that we may
present every man complete in Christ. For this purpose also I labor, striving
according to His power, which mightily works within me.&quot;  (Colossians 1:26-29,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;a renewal in which there is no distinction between Greek
and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave and freeman,
but Christ is all, and in all.&quot;  (Colossians 3:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>During the Tribulation, the Church must be absent because
God seals 144,000 Jews, 12 from each tribe, reflecting the fact that these
seven years are Jewish in flavor rather than neither Jew nor Gentile, bond nor
free. The only Church mentioned in Revelation 6 through Revelation 19 is the
false, harlot church. The true Church, if present on earth, would not be
ignored. </p>

<p class=Verses>“The Spirit and the bride say, “Come.” And let the one who
hears say, “Come.” And let the one who is thirsty come; let the one who wishes
take the water of life without cost. I testify to everyone who hears the words
of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the
plagues which are written in this book; and if anyone takes away from the words
of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his part from the tree of life
and from the holy city, which are written in this book. He who testifies to
these things says, “Yes, I am coming quickly.” Amen. Come, Lord Jesus.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation
22:17-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Church Age Ends at the Rapture, Seven Years Before
the Second Advent.</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Thessalonians 4:17, “caught up together” is the
Greek word <span lang=EL>α</span>̔<span lang=EL>ρπα</span>́<span lang=EL>ζω</span>
(harpazō) and means to be caught up or to be carried away. The Latin
translation used the word <i>rapturo</i> from which we get the English word “rapture.”
</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together
with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we shall always be
with the Lord.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Thessalonians 4:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are two major interpretations of Scripture
regarding the Rapture of the Church. One is called Pre-tribulationalism where
the Rapture occurs before the seven years of the Tribulation. The other interpretation
is Post-tribulationalism where the Rapture occurs after the Tribulation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Pre-tribulationalism rests essentially on one major
premise, the literal method of interpretation of the Scriptures. As an adjunct
to this, the pre-tribulationists believe in a dispensational interpretation of
the Word of God. They find that the Word makes many distinctions between Israel
and the Church. Also, the Church is a mystery not revealed in the Old
Testament. Only the Pre-tribulation position guards the biblical teaching of the
imminence of the Rapture meaning that Jesus Christ can return for the Church at
any time.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Post-tribulationalism erroneously takes the
Pre-tribulation position and is quite new, having started with the Darbyites,
known as Plymouth Brethren. However, the early Church believed in the imminent
return of Christ. 1 Thess. 4:13-18. Paul looked for the imminent blessed hope
in Titus 2:13. Many of the Church fathers believed in an imminent return in the
1st , 2nd, 3rd, and 4th centuries AD. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the
glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus,&quot;  (Titus 2:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A distinction must be made between the Rapture and Second
Advent in the area of signs. Since the Church is given the hope of an imminent
return of Christ, there can be no signs given to her as to when this event will
take place.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Conditions That Will Exist Prior to the Rapture</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are many signs concerning the Second Advent, but no
signs concerning the Rapture of the Church. However, certain conditions will
exist at the end of the Church Age. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There will be denial of God. 2 Tim. 3:2-5. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money,
boastful, arrogant, revilers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy,
unloving, irreconcilable, malicious gossips, without self-control, brutal,
haters of good, treacherous, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather
than lovers of God, holding to a form of godliness, although they have denied
its power; Avoid such men as these.&quot;  (2 Timothy 3:2-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There will be denial of Christ. 1 John 2:18; 1 John 4:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Children, it is the last hour; and just as you heard that
antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have appeared; from this we
know that it is the last hour.&quot;  (1 John 2:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from
God; this is the spirit of the antichrist, of which you have heard that it is
coming, and now it is already in the world.&quot;  (1 John 4:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There will be denial of Christ’s return. 2 Peter 3:3-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Know this first of all, that in the last days mockers
will come with their mocking, following after their own lusts, and saying,
&quot;Where is the promise of His coming? For ever since the fathers fell
asleep, all continues just as it was from the beginning of
creation.&quot;&quot;  (2 Peter 3:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There will be denial of the faith. 1 Tim. 4:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some
will fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and
doctrines of demons, by means of the hypocrisy of liars seared in their own
conscience as with a branding iron,&quot;  (1 Timothy 4:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There will be denial of sound doctrine and Christian
liberty. 2 Tim. 4:3-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For the time will come when they will not endure sound
doctrine; but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for
themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires, and will turn away
their ears from the truth and will turn aside to myths.&quot;  (2 Timothy
4:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There will be denial of the separated life, of authority,
and of morals. 2 Tim. 3:1-13; Jude 1:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;that they were saying to you, &quot;In the last time
there will be mockers, following after their own ungodly lusts.&quot;&quot; 
(Jude 1:18, NASB)</p>
