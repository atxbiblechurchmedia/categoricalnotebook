<h2>The Local Church </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Local Church Purpose </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are four main principles regarding the purpose of
the local church. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Building up the believer in the local congregation.</u>
This would be the basic function. Taking the believer to spiritual maturity.
Scriptures are abundant. Methods include daily classes, recorded lessons,
literature, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Evangelization and missions:</u> Scriptures are
abundant and to challenge this concept would be stupid. Providing to others
outside the local assembly, information for edification purposes. 1 Cor. 9:7-15.
Also the other sheep concept in John 10:16. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Each one must do just as he has purposed in his heart,
not grudgingly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.&quot;  (2
Corinthians 9:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For the ministry of this service is not only fully
supplying the needs of the saints, but is also overflowing through many
thanksgivings to God.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 9:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;I have other sheep, which are not of this fold; I
must bring them also, and they will hear My voice; and they will become one
flock with one shepherd.&quot;  (John 10:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Training of spiritual gifts</u>: Deacons must first be
proved and includes the communication gifts as well as the administration
gifts. One of the responsibilities is to teach men that they may be able to
teach others also. 1 Tim. 3.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Timothy 2:2, “entrust” is the second aorist middle
indicative of <span lang=EL>παρατι</span>́<span lang=EL>θημι</span>
(paratithēmi). Paul commands Timothy, the pastor of the church at Ephesus, to
teach other men whose purpose it will be to teach others also. “Teach” is the
aorist active infinitive of <span lang=EL>διδα</span>́<span lang=EL>σκω</span>
(didaskō) and is a command not given to a church, but to a pastor of a church,
who is to teach men who will be able to teach.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The things which you have heard from me in the presence
of many witnesses, entrust these to faithful men who will be able to teach
others also.&quot;  (2 Timothy 2:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The practice of training other men for the ministry:</u>
This was done by the Lord Himself, of the disciples, in the Gospels. This was
done by Paul of many men mentioned in the book of Acts. This was commanded of
Timothy as the pastor of the Ephesus church. 2 Tim. 2. Titus was told to ordain
men to the ministry that had been taught. Titus 1. Paul admonished many of the churches
to accept his men in training as they would minister occasionally. 1 Cor.
16:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without
cause to be afraid, for he is doing the Lord's work, as I also am.&quot;  (1
Corinthians 16:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Certain men were chosen to be seconds to Paul in his
ministry. This was an act of the church. Titus and another brother were helpers
in the ministry. Financial responsibility to Titus and the brother was enjoined
by Paul upon the Corinthians. Paul administrated the finances of the
communicating leadership. 2 Cor. 8:16-24; 2 Cor. 8:8. 2 Corinthians 8:24 is
explained by 2 Corinthians 8:8 in context. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore openly before the churches, show them the proof
of your love and of our reason for boasting about you.&quot;  (2 Corinthians
8:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I am not speaking this as a command, but as proving
through the earnestness of others the sincerity of your love also.&quot;  (2
Corinthians 8:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 8:19, “appointed” is the aorist passive
participle of <span lang=EL>χειροτονε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(cheirotoneō) and means to appoint by vote and therefore, to enable one to
have charge of some office or duty. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and not only this, but he has also been appointed by the
churches to travel with us in this gracious work, which is being administered
by us for the glory of the Lord Himself, and to show our readiness,&quot;  (2
Corinthians 8:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Local Church Priorities</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is one pastor-teacher per local church with final
authority. He has four priorities, to study, to teach, to work with the church
deacon board to resolve problems in the local church, and to exercise
leadership authority over his family. Phil. 1:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus, To all
the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, including the overseers and
deacons:&quot;  (Philippians 1:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The deacons’ priorities are to take in Bible doctrine
daily, to oversee local church function, to exercise their spiritual gift of
administration by carrying out local church policy, to troubleshoot problems in
the local church, to function as examples of grace application in their job
where they earn a living, and to exercise leadership authority over their families.
1 Tim. 3; 1 Tim. 5:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But if anyone does not provide for his own, and
especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse
than an unbeliever.&quot;  (1 Timothy 5:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For men in the congregation, the priority order should be
daily intake of Bible doctrine, daily prayer, your wife, your family including
raising your children, and lastly your job. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For women in the congregation, the priority order should
be daily intake of Bible doctrine, daily  prayer, your husband, your family including
raising your children, and lastly your job either in business or as a household
manager.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The ultimate purpose of the local church is to grow
spiritually the congregation of believers who will thereby function under their
spiritual gifts.<b> </b>Eph. 4:12; Eph. 4:15-16; 1 Cor. 10; Deut. 32.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;for the equipping of the saints for the work of service,
to the building up of the body of Christ;&quot;  (Ephesians 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all
aspects into Him who is the head, even Christ, from whom the whole body, being
fitted and held together by what every joint supplies, according to the proper
working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building
up of itself in love.&quot;  (Ephesians 4:15-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The local church is the basis for missionary activity.
The local church should be supported in the Church Age. A sound missionary
organization proceeds out of sound local churches resulting in missionaries
founding sound local churches in other countries. The Church began by meeting
in homes for Bible class. Rom. 16:5; Acts 12:12; Col. 4:15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“also greet the church that is in their house. Greet Epaenetus,
my beloved, who is the first convert to Christ from Asia.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
16:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And when he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the
mother of John who was also called Mark, where many were gathered together and
were praying.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 12:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Greet the brethren who are in Laodicea and also Nympha and the
church that is in her house.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Colossians 4:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Local Church Selection</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A local church is a group of believers living in one
geographical location generally meeting in a building of some kind or a home,
and in the early Church under persecution, a cave or catacomb. 1 Cor. 1:2; 1
Thes. 1:1; Phil. 1:1; Rev. 2; Rev. 3. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;To the church of God which is at Corinth, to those who
have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, saints by calling, with all who in every
place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours:&quot;  (1
Corinthians 1:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Paul and Silvanus and Timothy, To the church of the
Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and
peace.&quot;  (1 Thessalonians 1:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus, To all
the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, including the overseers and
deacons:&quot;  (Philippians 1:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is limited to the believers in that area, whereas the
universal Church includes all believers dead and living everywhere. Eph.
1:22-23; Eph. 5:25-27; Col. 1:17-19; Col. 2:9-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He put all things in subjection under His feet, and
gave Him as head over all things to the church, which is His body, the fullness
of Him who fills all in all.&quot;  (Ephesians 1:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the
church and gave Himself up for her, so that He might sanctify her, having
cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, that He might present to
Himself the church in all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle or any such
thing; but that she would be holy and blameless.” (Ephesians 5:25-27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together.
He is also head of the body, the church; and He is the beginning, the firstborn
from the dead, so that He Himself will come to have first place in everything.
For it was the Father's good pleasure for all the fullness to dwell in Him,”
(Colossians 1:17-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For in Him all the fullness of Deity dwells in bodily
form, and in Him you have been made complete, and He is the head over all rule
and authority;&quot;  (Colossians 2:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When you enter a local church, how do you evaluate it to
confirm it is the one for you to obtain spiritual food? You should ask the
following questions. Is the local church emphasized? Is the Bible taught verse
by verse on a daily basis by a pastor-teacher with emphasis on knowing Bible
doctrine? Do the activities of the local church center in daily study and exposition
of the Word of God or does it emphasize a program to keep people busy who
attend? </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What is the attitude toward Hebrew, Greek, verbal
inspiration and literal interpretation? Is the categorical approach followed?
Is teaching evangelism used as well as person-to-person evangelism without
invading the privacy of the person taught? Is the youth interest built on Bible
doctrine or youth activities? Does missionary emphasis center on biblical
rapport rather than program or personality? </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ultimately, the right local church will be determined by
your ability to identify the one teaching Bible doctrine as your right pastor.
This doesn’t mean to have to like him personally or that you like his
personality, or anything about him. You identify him through his teaching as
your right pastor. Therefore recognition of the pastor’s authority and
submission to it is a must. Heb. 13:7; Heb. 13:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Remember those who led you, who spoke the word of God to
you; and considering the result of their conduct, imitate their faith.&quot; 
(Hebrews 13:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch
over your souls as those who will give an account. Let them do this with joy
and not with grief, for this would be unprofitable for you.&quot;  (Hebrews
13:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Church Membership</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Membership is for any believer who recognizes the
authority of the pastor-teacher and attends regularly. In the early Church, the
sermons were very long. Acts 20:6-12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“We sailed from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread,
and came to them at Troas within five days; and there we stayed seven days. On
the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul
began talking to them, intending to leave the next day, and he prolonged his
message until midnight. There were many lamps in the upper room where we were
gathered together. And there was a young man named Eutychus sitting on the
window sill, sinking into a deep sleep; and as Paul kept on talking, he was
overcome by sleep and fell down from the third floor and was picked up dead.
But Paul went down and fell upon him, and after embracing him, he said, “Do not
be troubled, for his life is in him.” When he had gone back up and had broken
the bread and eaten, he talked with them a long while until daybreak, and then
left. They took away the boy alive, and were greatly comforted.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts
20:6-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Membership in a local church requires that they be
believers in Jesus Christ. Acts 2:41; Acts 2:47.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So then, those who had received his word were baptized;
and that day there were added about three thousand souls.&quot;  (Acts 2:41,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;praising God and having favor with all the people. And
the Lord was adding to their number day by day those who were being
saved.&quot;  (Acts 2:47, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The local church includes members of the Body of Christ resulting
from the Baptism of the Holy Spirit at salvation. 1 Cor. 12:12-13; 1 Cor.
12:25-27.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For even as the body is one and yet has many members, and
all the members of the body, though they are many, are one body, so also is
Christ. For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or
Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one
Spirit.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 12:12-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;so that there may be no division in the body, but that
the members may have the same care for one another. And if one member suffers,
all the members suffer with it; if one member is honored, all the members
rejoice with it. Now you are Christ's body, and individually members of
it.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 12:25-27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Members of the Body of Christ must do all things decently
and in order. Therefore, the local church must do all things decently and in
order. 1 Cor. 14:40.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But all things must be done properly and in an orderly
manner.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 14:40, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Timothy 5:8-9, “put on the list” refers to church
membership and with it an obligation of the local church to render aid to those
who are unable to provide for themselves by other means. In this case, it was a
poor widow with no other means to support herself. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But if anyone does not provide for his own, and
especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse
than an unbeliever. A widow is to be put on the list only if she is not less
than sixty years old, having been the wife of one man,&quot;  (1 Timothy 5:8-9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Peter 5:2, “the flock of God among you” refers to a
specific local church group.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;shepherd the flock of God among you, exercising oversight
not under compulsion, but voluntarily, according to the will of God; and not
for sordid gain, but with eagerness;&quot;  (1 Peter 5:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Hebrews 10:25, “assembling together” is <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span
lang=EL>πισυναγωγη</span>́ (episunagōgē) and means an assembly of believers,
a gathering. Today, the local church is where they are to assemble. The local
church building can be anything that the pastor and deacon board have
determined. It may even be the home of one of the congregation who has offered
their home for services. This was common in the early Church. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the
habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more as you see the day
drawing near.&quot;  (Hebrews 10:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When churches were persecuted, they met anywhere they
could. There were no church buildings until the union of the church and state.
The last sanctuary or temple was destroyed in 70 AD. Church buildings came
after 300 AD. They observed the Lord’s Supper every Sunday. The Word of God
should be taught daily so believers can get doctrine daily. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Ingredients of a Good Congregation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Strangely, a good congregation is not a religious
congregation, nor a rich congregation, nor the in congregation in town. It does
not have to have a dignified gentleman as the pastor, nor does it have to have
a program. It does not have religious salesmen peddling their wares door to
door.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A good congregation is one that is positive to Bible
doctrine and recognizes the primacy of the Word of God. In Revelation chapters
2 and 3, seven different local church congregations are evaluated. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s will for dissemination of Bible doctrine in the
Church Age is a local church. Matt. 16:18; Rev. 2; Rev. 3. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this
rock I will build My church; and the gates of Hades will not overpower
it.&quot;  (Matthew 16:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The only bona fide classroom for teaching doctrine in the
Church Age is a local church headed up by a pastor-teacher. Eph. 4:11-13. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and
some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the
saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ; until
we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of
God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the
fullness of Christ.&quot;  (Ephesians 4:11-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher should be passionate about teaching his
congregation Bible doctrine on a daily basis. As the pastor-teacher teaches
doctrine, the capacity of the congregation to love Jesus Christ increases. This
capacity is increased because they are functioning under the grace apparatus
for perception. This is only possible as a pastor functions under the ICE
concept (isagogically, categorically, and exegetically) of Scriptural
interpretation. Phil. 2:25-30.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore I have sent him all the more eagerly so that
when you see him again you may rejoice and I may be less concerned about you.
Receive him then in the Lord with all joy, and hold men like him in high
regard;&quot;  (Philippians 2:28-29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The congregation must have positive volition toward Bible
doctrine being taught resulting in assembling to hear more doctrine. In
Philippians 2:29, “Receive” is <span lang=EL>προσδε</span>́<span lang=EL>χομαι</span>
(prosdechomai) and means to receive to one’s self, to admit, to give access to
one’s self. This is face-to-face teaching. Heb. 10:25. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Receive him then in the Lord with all joy, and hold men
like him in high regard;&quot;  (Philippians 2:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the
habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more as you see the day
drawing near.&quot;  (Hebrews 10:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God can multiply a local church’s ministry into a
worldwide testimony. Rom. 1:7-8. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;to all who are beloved of God in Rome, called as saints:
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. First, I
thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, because your faith is being
proclaimed throughout the whole world.&quot;  (Romans 1:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God constantly evaluates local congregations and tests
them. Rev. 2 and 3. The ingredients of a good congregation include teachable positive
believers who are faithful to the Word of God. To function as a congregation,
they must also respect the privacy and the rights of other believer-priests.
The inevitable result is that relaxed atmosphere of live and let live even
while being tested or enduring undeserved suffering. Rev. 2:5; Rev. 2:10. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;'Therefore remember from where you have fallen, and
repent and do the deeds you did at first; or else I am coming to you and will
remove your lampstand out of its place—unless you repent.&quot;  (Revelation
2:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;'Do not fear what you are about to suffer. Behold, the
devil is about to cast some of you into prison, so that you will be tested, and
you will have tribulation for ten days. Be faithful until death, and I will
give you the crown of life.&quot;  (Revelation 2:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ingredients of a good congregation include being able to
handle spiritual testing and undeserved suffering. They will be rewarded at the
Judgment Seat of Christ. They hate false doctrine and love divine truth. They stay
in fellowship the majority of the time and by doing so, avoid divine discipline.
They hear and believe the Bible doctrine taught and stay positive so they can
be effective in the Angelic Conflict. Rev. 2:14-16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;'But I have a few things against you, because you have
there some who hold the teaching of Balaam, who kept teaching Balak to put a
stumbling block before the sons of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols
and to commit acts of immorality. 'So you also have some who in the same way
hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans. 'Therefore repent; or else I am coming to
you quickly, and I will make war against them with the sword of My
mouth.&quot;  (Revelation 2:14-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The good congregation should have inner happiness in
their souls from the intake of doctrine as well as the edification complex of
the soul and maximum doctrine in the right lobe. The good congregation grows to
spiritual maturity. This means freedom from reversionism. This means having
objectivity so that the congregation can benefit from the pastor’s ministry
without getting tangled up in or being disillusioned by the pastor’s old sin
nature. Rev. 3:1-6; Rev. 3:2; Luke 8:14. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;'Wake up, and strengthen the things that remain, which
were about to die; for I have not found your deeds completed in the sight of My
God.&quot;  (Revelation 3:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;'He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to
the churches.'&quot;  (Revelation 3:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;The seed which fell among the thorns, these are the
ones who have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with worries
and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to maturity.&quot; 
(Luke 8:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The good congregation knows dispensational truth.  There
is no confusion about the place of the Jews as a nation. There is no confusion between
the Church Age and the Tribulation. Rev. 3:7-13; Rev. 3:9-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;'Behold, I will cause those of the synagogue of Satan,
who say that they are Jews and are not, but lie—I will make them come and bow
down at your feet, and make them know that I have loved you. 'Because you have
kept the word of My perseverance, I also will keep you from the hour of
testing, that hour which is about to come upon the whole world, to test those
who dwell on the earth.&quot;  (Revelation 3:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The good congregation comprehends the folly of being a
lukewarm Christian. Rev. 3:14-22</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;'I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot; I
wish that you were cold or hot. 'So because you are lukewarm, and neither hot
nor cold, I will spit you out of My mouth.&quot;  (Revelation 3:15-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;'Those whom I love, I reprove and discipline; therefore
be zealous and repent. 'Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears
My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and will dine with him, and
he with Me.&quot;  (Revelation 3:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Local Church Finances</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The principle of equal responsibility is stated in 2
Corinthians 8:9-15. As there should be an equality in giving so there should be
an equality in handling. One believer does not give to alleviate the
responsibility of the giving of another believer. Even so, one fund should not
be used to alleviate the responsibility of another fund. Just as a believer
cannot rely on another to take up his slack, neither can one fund rely on
another fund to take up its slack. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that
though He was rich, yet for your sake He became poor, so that you through His
poverty might become rich.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 8:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;at this present time your abundance being a supply for
their need, so that their abundance also may become a supply for your need,
that there may be equality;&quot;  (2 Corinthians 8:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The principle of communicator’s priority is found in Acts
6:3-4. This is the matter of the business of the local church being given to
deacons to allow the communicator to give himself to the ministry of the Word
unhindered by the normal pursuits of life. If the deacon duties can distract
communicators, much more so do the normal life pursuits hinder the ministry of
the communicators.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Therefore, brethren, select from among you seven
men of good reputation, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may put in
charge of this task. &quot;But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the
ministry of the word.&quot;&quot;  (Acts 6:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The principle of support of communicators is found in 2
Corinthians 12:13. Much is made of the tentmaking of Paul. Not much, however,
is said that this was done under the principle of supreme sacrifice and not the
norm or standard. Paul states that the inferiority of the Corinthian church was
in the area of non-support to him. Paul says, “Forgive me this wrong.”</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For in what respect were you treated as inferior to the
rest of the churches, except that I myself did not become a burden to you?
Forgive me this wrong!&quot;  (2 Corinthians 12:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 12:13, “wrong” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span
lang=EL>δικι</span>́<span lang=EL>α</span> (adikia) and means the wrong of
depriving another of what is his. The Corinthians were deprived of their
rightful responsibility to support Paul. Paul’s taking from the other churches
deprived them of their responsibility. As a result, they were inferior.
“Inferior” is the aorist passive indicative of <span lang=EL>η</span>̔<span
lang=EL>ττα</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (hēttaō) and means that they were
made this way by Paul’s actions. It means to be less than they should be by
now.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 11:8-9 and 2 Corinthians 11:12, we find
the statements of Paul’s actions regarding support and the accompanying
factors. In 2 Corinthians 11:8, “I robbed other churches” is <span lang=EL>συλα</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (sulaō) and means to rob, to plunder. This Greek word is
closely connected to another Greek word σκῦλον (skulon) which means to take
the skin off someone. It means to strip the body of arms, to peal the arms from
the body. The robbing is described by the aorist active participle of <span
lang=EL>λαμβα</span>́<span lang=EL>νω</span> (lambanō) and means taking or
receiving. His robbing of other churches was the receiving of support, while at
the same time, the Corinthian church was getting the benefit.</p>

<p class=Verses> &quot;I robbed other churches by taking wages from them to
serve you;&quot;  (2 Corinthians 11:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But what I am doing I will continue to do, so that I may
cut off opportunity from those who desire an opportunity to be regarded just as
we are in the matter about which they are boasting.&quot;  (2 Corinthians
11:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 11:9, “burden” is <span lang=EL>καταναρκα</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (katanarkaō) and means to weigh heavily upon. Paul states
that he did not weigh heavily upon them for support and there was a definite
reason behind it. In 2 Corinthians 12:13, Paul uses the same term to define his
wrong to them. Paul did accept support from the Macedonian believers to help in
the Corinthian work. But this was for a very specific purpose stated in 2
Corinthians 12:12</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and when I was present with you and was in need, I was
not a burden to anyone; for when the brethren came from Macedonia they fully
supplied my need, and in everything I kept myself from being a burden to you,
and will continue to do so.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 11:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The signs of a true apostle were performed among you with
all perseverance, by signs and wonders and miracles.&quot;  (2 Corinthians
12:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>However, one must remember we are talking of the
functions of one man, an apostle, operating in several churches, not just one
church, operating as a man, not as a corporate body of believers. The purpose
for Paul’s actions set forth in 2 Corinthians 12:12. This was done to “cut off
opportunity from those who desire an opportunity to be regarded.” This was done
to eliminate anything or anyone from using this as a gripe tactic.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>2 Corinthians 11:12, “occasion” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span
lang=EL>φορμη</span>́ (aphormē) and has several meanings taken together which
give the import of Paul’s reasons for not demanding support from the
Corinthians. They are; a base from which one attacks another with reference to
an attack on a financial basis, that by which an endeavor is excited and goes
forth, that which provides the incentive for other actions, and the opportunity
or resource to which we look to get something done.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But what I am doing I will continue to do, so that I may
cut off opportunity from those who desire an opportunity to be regarded just as
we are in the matter about which they are boasting.&quot;  (2 Corinthians
11:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>2 Corinthians 11:12, “desire” is the present active
participle of <span lang=EL>θε</span>́<span lang=EL>λω</span> (thelō) and
means to wish for a thing. It is without the article in Greek, therefore, is
anartharous in construction. This means that the participle indicates that the
action described in the participle is a characteristic of the person. In other
words, Paul knew that there were some Corinthians who were always looking for
something to nail him with. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is indicated by the last phrase in 2 Corinthians 11:12
“to be regarded just as we are” means that in order that they might glory,
having caught Paul, and therefore, show themselves just like him. In other
words, he has found things wrong with them and pointed it out. Now they
continually look for something in him that they can point out and be equal with
him. He knows this financial issue is just the thing they would pounce on.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The entire chapter of 1 Corinthians 9 sets forth the
concept that the ones who communicate live by the resources to whom they
communicate.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Church Universal</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers are said to be “in Christ” during the Church
Age. This is Positional Truth. This is the Church universal. No matter how
carnal or how much in emotional revolt or reversionism, you are in Christ, if
you have been saved. There is no way to be kicked out of the Church universal.
1 Cor. 1:2; 1 Cor. 1:30; Rom. 8:1; Rom. 8:38-39; 2 Cor. 5:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;To the church of God which is at Corinth, to those who
have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, saints by calling, with all who in every
place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours:&quot;  (1
Corinthians 1:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But by His doing you are in Christ Jesus, who became to
us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and
redemption,&quot;  (1 Corinthians 1:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are
in Christ Jesus.&quot;  (Romans 8:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor
angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,
nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us
from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.&quot;  (Romans
8:38-39, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creature;
the old things passed away; behold, new things have come.&quot;  (2 Corinthians
5:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Corinthians 5:17, “old things are passed away” does
not mean to give up demon rum or going with wild women. There are no taboos
involved here. The applications are many. There is no such thing as closed
communion. That is blasphemy. 1 Cor. 11:22-32.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;What! Do you not have houses in which to eat and drink?
Or do you despise the church of God and shame those who have nothing? What
shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? In this I will not praise you.&quot; 
(1 Corinthians 11:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the
Lord in an unworthy manner, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the
Lord. But a man must examine himself, and in so doing he is to eat of the bread
and drink of the cup. For he who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgment to
himself if he does not judge the body rightly.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 11:27-29,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Regarding baptism, every time some people think of
baptism they think of water. Yet, there are seven baptisms in Scripture. In Ephesians
4:5, “One Lord, one faith, one baptism” is referring to the Baptism of the Holy
Spirit joining each of us into union with Christ at the point of salvation. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;one Lord, one faith, one baptism,&quot;  (Ephesians 4:5,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are so many goofy things are going on in local
churches today. They include loving everybody, get a program with every member
involved, get more youth directors, and have the choir directors direct this
and direct that. Everything but the systematic teaching of the Word of God. I
have ladies in my church who have more Bible doctrine than 80% of the
fundamental pastors around the country.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the Church universal, includes every believer in
Christ, living or dead. When you express faith in Jesus Christ to belong to the
Body of Christ (the Church universal), there is no biblical information on
“joining the local church.” 1 Cor. 12:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For even as the body is one and yet has many members, and
all the members of the body, though they are many, are one body, so also is
Christ.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 12:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>But, many, many passages indicate that local churches
were comprised of believers in the Lord Jesus Christ. Believers who recognized
the authority of the pastor-teacher. Believers who have the conviction that
this is my “right” pastor-teacher. 1 Cor. 12:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I do not want
you to be unaware.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 12:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 9:31, the word “church” is <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span
lang=EL>κκλησι</span>́<span lang=EL>α</span> (ekklēsia) and is an old Attic
Greek word for assembly. Athens was the only true democratic city-state in the
ancient world. Every citizen was a member of congress and when congress
convened they all assembled in a large hall (30,000 - 40,000) This was an <i>ekklēsia</i>.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and
Samaria enjoyed peace, being built up; and going on in the fear of the Lord and
in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it continued to increase.&quot;  (Acts 9:31,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some fraternities had an <i>ekklēsia</i>. In Acts 7:38,
“congregation” is the same word and is used for the assembly of Jews in the Old
Testament. This has nothing to do with the Church. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;This is the one who was in the congregation in the
wilderness together with the angel who was speaking to him on Mount Sinai, and
who was with our fathers; and he received living oracles to pass on to
you.&quot;  (Acts 7:38, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 18:17, you do not have a local church, but a
synagogue called an <i>ekklēsia</i>. In Acts 19:25, we have a meeting of a
union for business or political reasons. The word “church” does not appear in
the passage, but it does in secular background.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the
church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a
Gentile and a tax collector.&quot;  (Matthew 18:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;these he gathered together with the workmen of similar
trades, and said, &quot;Men, you know that our prosperity depends upon this
business.&quot;  (Acts 19:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Local Church Ultimates</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The local church is the ultimate authority from God and
for the communication of His thinking to believers in the Church Age. This
includes the precept which is the categorical imperative of Isaiah 28:9 and the
lines of Scripture, which furnish the fuel for the precepts.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;To whom would He teach knowledge, And to whom would
He interpret the message? Those just weaned from milk? Those just taken from
the breast?&quot;  (Isaiah 28:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The local church is the ultimate means of communication
from God through His Word. Matt. 28:19-20. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations,
baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit,
teaching them to observe all that I commanded you; and lo, I am with you
always, even to the end of the age.&quot;&quot;  (Matthew 28:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The local church communicates Bible doctrine
authoritatively through a man with the spiritual gift of pastor-teacher. He
eventually will teach on a daily basis. Heb. 3:13; Heb. 10:25.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But encourage one another day after day, as long as it is
still called &quot;Today,&quot; so that none of you will be hardened by the
deceitfulness of sin.&quot;  (Hebrews 3:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the
habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more as you see the day
drawing near.&quot;  (Hebrews 10:25, NASB)</p>
