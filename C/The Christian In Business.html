<h2>The Christian In Business</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Christian in business whether employer or employee is
in full time Christian service just as a missionary, pastor, evangelist or
Christian worker is in full time Christian service. Why? Every believer has the
same salvation. Jude 1:3; Eph. 4:11. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Beloved, while I was making every effort to write you about
our common salvation, I felt the necessity to write to you appealing that you
contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all handed down to the
saints.” (Jude 1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some
as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers,” (Ephesians 4:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every believer is an ambassador for Jesus Christ and
represents Him on earth. 2 Cor. 5:20. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were
making an appeal through us; we beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to
God.” (2 Corinthians 5:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every believer is exhorted to “walk in the Spirit,” to
“grow,” and to erect an edification complex in their soul. Gal. 5:16; 2 Peter
3:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the
desire of the flesh.” (Galatians 5:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory, both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.”
(2 Peter 3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers have a difference in spiritual gifts given by
grace and a difference of spiritual growth at any given period. No one can
dedicate themselves to full time Christian service because they are already
born-again into it. The Christian in business is regarded as being in full time
Christian service. The work-a-day world is divided into two categories - labor
and management. In business, the chain of command must recognized. 1 Cor. 12; 1
Tim. 6:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“All who are under the yoke as slaves are to regard their own
masters as worthy of all honor so that the name of God and our doctrine will
not be spoken against. Those who have believers as their masters must not be
disrespectful to them because they are brethren, but must serve them all the
more, because those who partake of the benefit are believers and beloved. Teach
and preach these principles.” (1 Timothy 6:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Mental and physical hard work are the oil of success in
the business world. Bosses are not to exploit their employees because the labor
is worthy of their hire. Also, the employee is to put in a full day’s work.
Gen. 3:19; 1 Tim. 6:2. </p>

<p class=Verses>“By the sweat of your face You will eat bread, Till you return
to the ground, Because from it you were taken; For you are dust, And to dust
you shall return.&quot;” (Genesis 3:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Those who have believers as their masters must not be
disrespectful to them because they are brethren, but must serve them all the
more, because those who partake of the benefit are believers and beloved. Teach
and preach these principles.” (1 Timothy 6:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer is to represent God in their business or
where they work. You represent God in your area of work, full time, just as the
pastor-teacher does for his local church. 1 Tim. 6:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If anyone advocates a different doctrine and does not agree
with sound words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ, and with the doctrine
conforming to godliness,” (1 Timothy 6:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Dishonesty in business, whether mental attitude sins,
sins of the tongue, or even overt sin will destroy your testimony as a believer
in business. A believer out of fellowship will eventually be inconsistent in
some way by griping, cheating, not putting more than a full day if necessary,
or not following orders to the letter, knifing others in the back, embezzling,
and so on. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The oil that makes business run as smoothly as possible
is godliness accompanied with contentment. Godliness gives stability in
business and refers to reflecting the glory of God. 1 Tim. 6:6; 1 Cor. 6:20.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“But godliness actually is a means of great gain when
accompanied by contentment.” (1 Timothy 6:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For you have been bought with a price: therefore glorify God
in your body.” (1 Corinthians 6:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Erecting the edification complex of the soul through the
consistent intake and application of <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine is only
possible through the filling of the Holy Spirit and results in Christ’s
character being formed within the believer. Contentment is the resultant mental
attitude of stability of spiritual self-sufficiency, satisfied with what God has
provided for you in grace, not restlessness. Gal. 4:19; Gal. 5:22-23.</p>

<p class=Verses>“My children, with whom I am again in labor until Christ is
formed in you—” (Galatians 4:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience,
kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things
there is no law.” (Galatians 5:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If a believer in business whether employee or employer
has inner spiritual stability, their outward needs are very simple. It is
actually the luxuries of life that cause inflation and one of the factors in
the weakness and instability of a nation. 1 Tim. 6:7-8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For we have brought nothing into the world, so we cannot take
anything out of it either. If we have food and covering, with these we shall be
content.” (1 Timothy 6:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Your mental attitude toward money is an indicator of an
edification complex or lack of it. Money is only a detail of life. If you have
it and are spiritually mature, you can enjoy it.  If you don’t have it, you
still have Bible doctrine and God's grace resources. 1 Tim. 6:9-10; Phil. 4:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a
snare and many foolish and harmful desires which plunge men into ruin and
destruction. For the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil, and some by
longing for it have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with
many griefs.” (1 Timothy 6:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Not that I speak from want, for I have learned to be content
in whatever circumstances I am.” (Philippians 4:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the business world, in your daily work, you may need a
crash program of Bible doctrine as the ultimate answer to your work-related
problems. This crash program should involve daily categorical Bible study.
Working hard does not necessarily mean 16-hour days on the job. Don’t confuse
hard work with long hours. There is no contradiction between the need for daily
Bible study and the command to work hard. 1 Tim. 6:11-12; Gen. 3:19; 1 Cor.
4:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But flee from these things, you man of God, and pursue
righteousness, godliness, faith, love, perseverance and gentleness. Fight the
good fight of faith; take hold of the eternal life to which you were called,
and you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.” (1 Timothy
6:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“By the sweat of your face You will eat bread, Till you return
to the ground, Because from it you were taken; For you are dust, And to dust
you shall return.&quot;” (Genesis 3:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore I exhort you, be imitators of me.” (1 Corinthians
4:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The gift of pastor-teacher takes the most study time of
any spiritual gift. But when a pastor-teacher does the spade work and
communicates the Word of God he has learned, you obtain a more concentrated and
correct input of Bible doctrine than in any other form. It is categorized, so
your study involves studying the portion of the Word that the pastor-teacher is
teaching or has taught. Spiritual self-sufficiency and maturity is the goal.</p>
