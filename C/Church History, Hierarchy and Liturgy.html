<h2><a name="_Church_History,_The_3"></a>Church History, The Development of the
Hierarchy and Liturgy of the Church</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The hierarchy in its beginning: </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The primacy of the Roman Bishop. He became “first among
equals.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The dominance of the Roman Bishop by 590 AD.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Arose because of a need for centralization of power. 
Arose because of a need for efficiency. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Resulted from historical events: Rome was the largest
city. Rome was the center of activity. There was the shift of imperial power to
the East. The bishop was the defense of Rome in the absence of the emperor. The
emperor in Constantinople was too remote. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Petrine doctrine was entrenched in the minds of
people, 590 AD, relating to the Roman bishop being in the apostolic succession
of Christ. Orthodox doctrines guaranteed by the bishop, expressed by church
councils. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The decline of other bishoprics: The Council of
Constantinople in 381 gave the primacy of bishops to Rome, placed him in
primacy. Patriarch given place second to the bishop. Emperor Valentinian III,
445 AD, recognized primacy of Roman bishop in spiritual matters.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Monks and missionaries gave much allegiance to the Roman
bishop.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Strong and able men in the chair at Rome: Damasus:
encouraged Jerome to write Latin Vulgate. Leo I: the strongest, defended Rome
against Attalla, the Hun; defended Rome against the Vandals.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The development of the liturgy of the Church</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The
secularization of the Church:</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Union of church and state under Constantine. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Patriarch became subject to emperors in the East but in
the West, the Pope or bishop of Rome remained over civil authority. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The influx of pagans in the West: liturgy adapted to the
customs of the pagans.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Church begins to look to the state for discipline.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Worship changed from democratic to aristocratic worship
and resulted in separation of the clergy and laity. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The results
of secularization of the Church: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Liturgy adapted to pagans: introduced idols, images,
angels, saints, etc. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Worship changed from democratic to aristocratic,
resulting in clergy and laity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Special days began to appear:  Sunday declared by
Constantine as the day of worship for the Roman Empire. Both church and state
recognized it, civil as well as religious. Christmas was established on a
yearly basis. The Feast Epiphany: a feast in January celebrating the coming of
the Magi to visit the infant Christ. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ceremonies became sacraments; outward sign instituted by
Christ to give grace. Marriage: by Augustine. Penance: by Cyprian. Ordination
and holy orders. Confirmation: done usually about 12-13 years of age after
catechism. Extreme unction: anointing by the priest before death. Baptism:
infant baptism washes away original sin. The mass: introduced Sacredotalism,
the belief that the substance of the ordinance is efficacious through the
priestly celebrant. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The development of the Doctrine of Mariolatry: The
veneration of Mary as the “Mother of God”: 590 AD. The Immaculate Conception
became dogma: 1854 AD.  The Miraculous Assumption, ascension of Mary, became
dogma: 1950 AD. Eternal virginity, by Clement and Tertullian.  Intercessory
prayers ascribed to Mary: 590 AD. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The development of the Veneration of Saints:  First,
relics. Secondly, images and pictures, materialized for pagans. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Pilgrimages: Became part of worship after 313 AD.  Gave
rise to the Crusades: </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Architecture: The basilica was for the unbaptized. The
church nave, for the baptized, the area behind the altar for the choir and
priests. The church was called a cathedral if it housed the chair of the
bishop.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Medieval Pope: 590-800 AD</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Gregory the Great: 590-604 AD. </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>His mother was a nun. He became the ambassador to
Constantinople from 579-589 AD.  He renounced his wealth.  He had a legal
education and was an administrator. He expanded the power of the Roman bishop
as Pope though he disdained this title, 590 AD. He became supreme over all as a
result of a conflict with John the Faster, Patriarch of Constantinople. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He was a missionary, sent Augustine to England as a
missionary. He was an administrator and financed the war against the Lombard
King. Organized the Gregorian Chant into worship. He was a writer and
theologian. In his theology he embraced; inherent sin as a disease; the will is
free, but its goodness is lost; purgatory; verbal inspiration, with tradition
equally inspired; involved in the growth of the sacrifice of mass; held to
predestination. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Medieval Popes: 590-816 AD. </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There were 38 popes during this period of time.  A sketch
on the popes from 590-816 AD (not all of them). </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Gregory, the Great: 590-604 AD </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Honorius I: 625-638 AD </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>St. Martin I: 649-555 AD </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>St. Zachary: 741-752 AD </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Stephen III: 752-757 AD </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Adrain I: 772-795 AD </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>St. Leo III: 795-816 AD</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>These will be sketched in brief to give a picture of the
papacy during the Medieval period of the church from 590-800 AD.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The sketches of the Medieval Popes (excluding Gregory,
the Great) </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Honorius I: 625-638 AD.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Was a disciple of Gregory the Great.  Had many
achievements but one major charge against him was that of his neglect in
settling a dispute on the unity of the Wills of Christ, without sufficient
consideration.  A later Pope, Leo II, at Council of Constantinople in 581
condemned Honorius for failing to denounce the heresy, monothelite
controversy.  For a time, all the Popes were required to denounce him, because
of this blunder, when they took the throne. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>St. Martin I: 649-655 AD </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When elected Pope he had himself consecrated before
getting the praise of the emperor. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He assembled a council of 105 bishops at Lateran and
defended the doctrine of the two wills of Christ and denounced the monothelites
again. The emperor, Constans II, finally succeeded in his control of Martin by
getting him removed to Constantinople where he tried him for treason and had
him exiled to Crimea. Martin died of starvation in Crimea because of neglect. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>St. Zachary: 741-752 AD </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Was a native of southern Italy, of Greek descent. Was
learned and eloquent. Translated into Greek the “dialogues” of Gregory, the
Great. Established a better relation between the Frankish kingdom while still
maintaining favor with the Greeks. Sanctioned the suppression of the
Merovingian dynasty and elevated Pepin the Short in the Frankish kingdom. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Stephen III: 752-757 AD</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>During his reign the Papal States were founded.  Had
difficulty with the Lombard kings so crossed the Alps to gain assistance from
Pepin the Short, the Frankish king.  Pepin had promised to make Stephen III a
temporal so after Pepin was successful against the Lombard kings, he returned
and gave the territory won from the Lombards to Stephen, placing the keys to
their cities on the tomb of St. Peter. April 26, 757 was the basic founding of
the Papal States.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Adrain 1: 772-795 AD </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He, too, was troubled by the Lombards and he called upon
Charlemagne who marched into Italy and conquered the Lombards’ kingdom and made
it a part of the Frankish kingdom.  In this victory, Charlemagne did several
things: Confirmed the donation of territory made by Pepin. Considered Rome a
Frankish city. Wanted to Germanize the church. After 780 Adrain I began to coin
money in his own name. Was much loved because of his care of the afflicted and
his care of all the churches. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>St. Leo III; 795-816 AD </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Leo followed Adrain I as the Pope, elected one day later.
 Adrain’s relatives led a bitter opposition to Leo, charged him with adultery,
waylaid him, maltreated and imprisoned him. He fled to the court of
Charlemagne. Charlemagne returned Leo safely to Rome and proceeded with an
investigation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Charlemagne became personally involved in the case about
800 AD. Charlemagne accepted Leo’s own testimony of innocence, since there was
no higher word than the Pope. His opposition were classed as rebels. Two days
later Leo crowned Charlemagne Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire in St. Peter’s.
Thus, established the Holy Roman Empire. This established a new relationship
between the Empire and the Papacy.</p>
