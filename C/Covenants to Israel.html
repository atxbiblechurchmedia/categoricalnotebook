<h2><a name="_D-Covenants_to_Israel"></a><a name="_Covenants_to_Israel"></a>Covenants
to Israel </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A covenant is a written agreement or promise usually
under seal between two or more parties especially for the performance of some
action. The covenants to Israel are God’s agreements and promises of grace
provision for the nation of Israel. The Hebrew word for “covenant” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>בּרית</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> (berı̂yth) in the Old Testament. In the New Testament, the
Greek word is <span lang=EL>διαθη</span>́<span lang=EL>κη</span> (diathēkē). Those
in the nation of Israel must be descendants of Abraham (racial Jews) and must
have accepted Jesus Christ as their Savior. To inherit God's eternal promise,
they must have eternal life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Jew had to believe in Jesus Christ as their Savior in
order to receive God's grace blessings of the unconditional covenants. The Jew
cannot gain their spiritual heritage without first believing in Jesus Christ. Being
a Jew genetically does not qualify anyone to benefit from these covenants.  Unbelievers
cannot inherit eternal life or benefit from these unconditional covenants. Only
Jewish believers benefit from these covenants.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Covenants are defined in the Old Testament as God
expressing favor toward some group of people. God's favor is always expressed
as grace provision. The ones being favored can never earn the grace that God
sovereignly bestows. God will always fulfill His promises because He is
infinitely able to do so through His omnipotence and He is also immutable, so
He cannot back out of the promises He makes. So the covenants to Israel can be
defined as the sovereign will of God establishing His promises to bless the nation
of Israel.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are five covenants to Israel. Four are unconditional
and one is conditional. The following diagram illustrates the four
unconditional covenants and their relationship to each other.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><img width=500 height=400 id="Picture 1"
src="Covenants%20to%20Israel.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Abrahamic Covenant </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Abrahamic Covenant is found in the conversation
between God and Abraham in Genesis 12, 13, 15, 17, and 22. Abraham and his seed
were promised land (the land of Canaan), seed (descendants), and blessing
(through faith) forever if they utilize God’s grace provision. This is the
basic covenant.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Abrahamic Covenant defines the new race of Jews for the
nation of Israel. Abraham became the first of a race of Jews and the first
Jewish believer at age 99. His circumcision was the outward sign of his belief
in the future Messiah for salvation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Abrahamic Covenant says that the seed of the woman,
the humanity of Christ, will descend from Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Gen. 12:1-3;
Gen. 13:15-16; Gen. 15:18; Gen. 22:15-18; Gen. 26:3-4; Exodus 6:2-8. See
category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/A/Abrahamic%20Covenant.html">The Abrahamic Covenant</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now the LORD said to Abram, &quot;Go forth from your
country, And from your relatives And from your father's house, To the land
which I will show you; And I will make you a great nation, And I will bless
you, And make your name great; And so you shall be a blessing; And I will bless
those who bless you, And the one who curses you I will curse. And in you all
the families of the earth will be blessed.&quot;&quot;  (Genesis 12:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;for all the land which you see, I will give it to you and
to your descendants forever. &quot;I will make your descendants as the dust of
the earth, so that if anyone can number the dust of the earth, then your
descendants can also be numbered.&quot;  (Genesis 13:15-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying,
&quot;To your descendants I have given this land, From the river of Egypt as
far as the great river, the river Euphrates:&quot;  (Genesis 15:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Palestinian or Land Covenant </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Palestinian or Land Covenant is based on the
Abrahamic Covenant and amplifies the land promises. Israel’s ownership of the
land is unconditional, but possession is based upon obedience to the plan of
salvation and spiritual growth in grace. Deut. 30:1-8; Gen. 15:18; Joshua 1:3-4;
Num. 34:1-12. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook//P/Palestinian%20or%20Land%20Covenant.html">The Palestinian or
Land Covenant</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying,
&quot;To your descendants I have given this land, From the river of Egypt as
far as the great river, the river Euphrates:&quot;  (Genesis 15:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Every place on which the sole of your foot treads,
I have given it to you, just as I spoke to Moses. &quot;From the wilderness and
this Lebanon, even as far as the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land
of the Hittites, and as far as the Great Sea toward the setting of the sun will
be your territory.&quot;  (Joshua 1:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Davidic Covenant </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Davidic Covenant amplifies the seed promises of the
Abrahamic Covenant. Among the seed (descendants of Abraham) would be the humanity
of the God-man Jesus Christ (the seed of the woman of Genesis 3:15) who would
descend from the tribe of Judah through the family of David and become the Savior
of mankind. 2 Sam. 7:12-16; Psalms 89:20-37. See category on <a
href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/D/The%20Davidic%20Covenant%20to%20Israel.html">The Davidic Covenant to Israel</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>““When your days are complete and you lie down with your
fathers, I will raise up your descendant after you, who will come forth from
you, and I will establish his kingdom. “He shall build a house for My name, and
I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. “I will be a father to him
and he will be a son to Me; when he commits iniquity, I will correct him with
the rod of men and the strokes of the sons of men, but My lovingkindness shall
not depart from him, as I took it away from Saul, whom I removed from before
you. “Your house and your kingdom shall endure before Me forever; your throne
shall be established forever.”‘““&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Samuel 7:12-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And I will put enmity Between you and the woman, And
between your seed and her seed; He shall bruise you on the head, And you shall
bruise him on the heel.&quot;&quot;  (Genesis 3:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The New Covenant </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The New Covenant promises the restoration of the nation of
Israel (only regenerate Jews) at the Second Advent of Jesus Christ. The
restored nation of Israel will exist in the Millennium. The New Covenant amplifies
the blessing promises of the Abrahamic Covenant. It provided for conversion
through the blood of the everlasting covenant and soul grace apparatus. Jer.
31:31-34; Rom. 11:27; Gal. 4:4; Heb. 8:8-12; Heb.10:15-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>““Behold, days are coming,” declares the LORD, “when I will
make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah, not
like the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day I took them by the
hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, My covenant which they broke,
although I was a husband to them,” declares the LORD. “But this is the covenant
which I will make with the house of Israel after those days,” declares the
LORD, “I will put My law within them and on their heart I will write it; and I
will be their God, and they shall be My people. “They will not teach again,
each man his neighbor and each man his brother, saying, ‘Know the LORD,’ for
they will all know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them,”
declares the LORD, “for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will
remember no more.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jeremiah 31:31-34, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;THIS IS MY COVENANT WITH THEM, WHEN I TAKE AWAY THEIR
SINS.&quot;” (Romans 11:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth
His Son, born of a woman, born under the Law,&quot;  (Galatians 4:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us; for after saying,
&quot;THIS IS THE COVENANT THAT I WILL MAKE WITH THEM AFTER THOSE DAYS, SAYS
THE LORD: I WILL PUT MY LAWS UPON THEIR HEART, AND ON THEIR MIND I WILL WRITE
THEM,&quot; He then says, &quot;AND THEIR SINS AND THEIR LAWLESS DEEDS I WILL
REMEMBER NO MORE.&quot;” (Hebrews 10:15-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The “seed of the woman,” the resurrected Jesus Christ,
will return to the earth at the Second Advent to restore the nation of Israel.
Our Lord will rule and bless the nation of Israel throughout the Millennium. See
category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/NO/New%20Covenant%20to%20Israel.html">The New Covenant to Israel</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Old Covenant or Mosaic Law</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Mosaic Law is God’s covenant to Israel that defines God’s
spiritual and governing policy for the nation of Israel. It is the only conditional
covenant to Israel and involves both believers and unbelievers. The Mosaic Law
contains God’s statutes and ordinances and laws that address every aspect of
life in the nation of Israel including legal freedoms, the laws and functions
of divine establishment, and the functions of the spiritual life for believers
in Israel. Exodus 19:3; Lev. 26:46; Rom. 3:19; Rom. 9:4.  See category on <a
href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/M/The%20Mosaic%20Law.html">The Mosaic Law</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Moses went up to God, and the LORD called to him from the
mountain, saying, &quot;Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob and tell the
sons of Israel:&quot;  (Exodus 19:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;These are the statutes and ordinances and laws which the
LORD established between Himself and the sons of Israel through Moses at Mount
Sinai.&quot;  (Leviticus 26:46, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now we know that whatever the Law says, it speaks to
those who are under the Law, so that every mouth may be closed and all the
world may become accountable to God;&quot;  (Romans 3:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;who are Israelites, to whom belongs the adoption as sons,
and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the Law and the temple
service and the promises,&quot;  (Romans 9:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><a name="_Davidic_Covenant"></a><b>Covenants, Survey of
Genesis to Lamentations</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Genesis</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Abrahamic Covenant: Gen. 12:1-3: Land, seed, blessing.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now the LORD said to Abram, &quot;Go forth from your
country, And from your relatives And from your father's house, To the land
which I will show you; And I will make you a great nation, And I will bless
you, And make your name great; And so you shall be a blessing; And I will bless
those who bless you, And the one who curses you I will curse. And in you all
the families of the earth will be blessed.&quot;&quot;  (Genesis 12:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Exodus</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Law: the format for obedience under Palestinian
Covenant and staying in the Promised Land.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Leviticus</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Abrahamic Covenant - basically the Palestinian
Covenant because it deals with possession of the Land. Not the gaining it, but
the holding of it. The five cycles of discipline. Leviticus 26.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Numbers</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Abrahamic Covenant - first opportunity at Palestinian
Covenant. National Discipline - 38 1/2 years in wilderness. Jewish Dispensation
- two generation concept.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Deuteronomy</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Abrahamic Covenant - preparation to enter upon the
Palestinian Covenant. Deut. 12:l-32; Deut. 28 through Deut. 30. The second
statement of the Law.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Joshua</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Abrahamic Covenant - Palestinian division of the Covenant
in focus. The acquisition of part of the land but failure to take all of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Judges</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Abrahamic Covenant - Palestinian Covenant threatened.
Ownership of the land, always secure. Possession, conditional, therefore
hanging in the balance.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Ruth</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Relationship to Covenants only in the perpetuation of
seed of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob; Ruth in line of David, therefore the Davidic
Covenant.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>1 Samuel</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Abrahamic Covenant - the Land partially occupied though
still containing many enemies. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>2 Samuel</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Abrahamic Covenant: The actual format of the Davidic
Covenant under three principles - house, kingdom and throne. The establishing
of the lineage of David as line of the Messiah and building this on his son,
Solomon’s line. David’s life and discipline. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>1 Kings</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Abrahamic Covenant - about to lose the Land, great
apostacy from the Law.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>2 Kings</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Abrahamic Covenant. Royal line of David constantly
threatened. Palestinian Covenant under constant threat because of breaking
Mosaic Covenant. Royal line of David constantly threatened ended with removal
of north and south from the land under the Fifth Cycle of Discipline.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>1 Chronicles and 2 Chronicles</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Five cycles of discipline - Chronicles ends with both
north and south in captivity, North to Assyria, South to Babylon.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Ezra</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Abrahamic Covenant - Judah again in their land,
possessing it, under the Palestinian Covenant. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Nehemiah</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Abrahamic Covenant - Israel in part, Judah technically,
back in the land to begin anew, later to come under the fourth cycle of
discipline under Rome in 63 BC, then to the Fifth Cycle of Discipline under
Titus the Roman general in 70 AD.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Esther</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Covenant Relationship - Davidic Covenant--preservation of
the Seed, remnant while in captivity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Job</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>No particular identification with the Abrahamic Covenant.
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Psalms</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>No particular identification with the Abrahamic Covenant.
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Ecclesiastes</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ecclesiastes does not relate to the covenants except in
the fact that Solomon, the one involved, was to be the major executor of the
Davidic Covenant from the standpoint of house, kingdom, and throne. The major
contribution of the book of Ecclesiastes is to show the human viewpoint
thinking, procedures and end of a mature believer in reversion.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Song of Solomon</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>No particular identification with the Abrahamic Covenant.
