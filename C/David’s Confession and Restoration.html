<h2>David’s Confession and Restoration After the Bathsheba Incident </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 51:1, David prayed for God to have mercy on
him. He had recognized the slavery of sin.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For the choir director. A Psalm of David, when Nathan the
prophet came to him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba. Be gracious to me, O
God, according to Your lovingkindness; According to the greatness of Your
compassion blot out my transgressions.” (Psalms 51:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 51:2, David prayed for God to blot out his
transgressions. He had recognized the need for isolation of sins. He wanted God
to wash him from iniquity, his sins. This was David’s recognition of cleansing
with emphasis on the process. He had recognized the moral consequences of his
sins. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity And cleanse me from my
sin.” (Psalms 51:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 51:3-4, David recognized his transgression and
his sin. He also recognized that he had sinned against God and he understood
God's right to administer divine discipline. Psalms 51:3-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For I know my transgressions, And my sin is ever before me.
Against You, You only, I have sinned And done what is evil in Your sight, So
that You are justified when You speak And blameless when You judge.” (Psalms
51:3-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 51:5-6, we have David’s desire was to be
cleansed of his sin and transgression. David realized that the source of his
sin and transgression was his own negative volition tempted by his own old sin
nature. David recognized his sinful state and confessed his sin to God the
Father. David realized that he had sinned against God and God had the right to
bring discipline on him for what he had done. David understood what God wanted
in his spiritual life. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, And in sin my mother
conceived me. Behold, You desire truth in the innermost being, And in the
hidden part You will make me know wisdom.” (Psalms 51:5-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 51:7-8, David realized how that process became
real and the objective realized. David identified the Bible doctrine for
application pertinent to his need. David’s thoughts turned to the lost joy and
happiness when a believer is out of fellowship. Back in fellowship, he was able
to see from divine viewpoint the utterly horrible nature of sin and the
repulsiveness of sin.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Purify me with hyssop” was his recognition of Old
Testament sacrifices. He recognized his personal need for cleansing from sin
and desired to be washed and made clean. David wants God to make him to “hear
joy and gladness.” This was his recognition of inner happiness.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Purify me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; Wash me, and I
shall be whiter than snow. Make me to hear joy and gladness, Let the bones
which You have broken rejoice.” (Psalms 51:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>David recognized the shamefulness of sin and that God
cannot look on sin. He was intent on the isolation of his sins. Psalms 51:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Hide Your face from my sins And blot out all my iniquities.”
(Psalms 51:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>David’s mind turned to the rebuilding of that which was
broken down. He surveyed the damage caused by what he had done and recognized
the rebuilding process needed. David recognized that removal of scar tissue in
his soul was necessary. He had a great appreciation for the fellowship and
friendship of God and didn’t want to be turned aside from this. Psalms 51:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Create in me a clean heart, O God, And renew a steadfast
spirit within me.” (Psalms 51:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>David was momentarily struck with the realization that
the enduement of the Holy Spirit could be removed as divine discipline. He did
not want that. He recognized the need for fellowship with God the Holy Spirit
in the Jewish dispensation. Psalms 51:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do not cast me away from Your presence And do not take Your
Holy Spirit from me.” (Psalms 51:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>David recognized the need for inner happiness and the
only means of gaining this is God’s sustaining grace. He also recognized his
responsibility once personally restored to fellowship with the Holy Spirit.
Psalms 51:12-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Restore to me the joy of Your salvation And sustain me with a
willing spirit. Then I will teach transgressors Your ways, And sinners will be
converted to You.” (Psalms 51:12-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Again David cried out for the joy, capacity of inner
happiness, and the sustainment of God. From his own desires and needs, he
became aware once again of his objectives, his purpose, his ministry, that they
might not follow the path he had previously taken. His realization of personal
influence jarred him. He realized his positive impact on people in instruction
and his negative impact from his sinning. He no longer wanted any part of that.
“Deliver me from bloodguiltiness” and “open my lips” were David’s recognition
of God’s enablement. Psalms 51:14-15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, the God of my
salvation; Then my tongue will joyfully sing of Your righteousness. O Lord,
open my lips, That my mouth may declare Your praise.” (Psalms 51:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>David recognized that only God can provide enablement for
divine good production. He had already blown most things. Only God could
salvage what was left. He got the point formed and stated as if it suddenly hit
him: God does not want sacrifices, He wants changed souls, then He will accept
the sacrifices. David anticipated the time of sacrificing as normal with the
blessings of God. The doctrines of God are portrayed in the sacrifices in the
temple. Psalms 51:16-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For You do not delight in sacrifice, otherwise I would give
it; You are not pleased with burnt offering. The sacrifices of God are a broken
spirit; A broken and a contrite heart, O God, You will not despise.” (Psalms
51:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>David closes his “confession of sin” by a return to the
rebuilding of his soul. Terms for Zion and Israel were used idiomatically for
David’s private life. This was often done in the Old Testament. David
recognized the needs of others and the damage caused to his kingdom while in
the 15 months of reversionism. Psalms 51:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“By Your favor do good to Zion; Build the walls of Jerusalem.”
(Psalms 51:18, NASB)</p>
