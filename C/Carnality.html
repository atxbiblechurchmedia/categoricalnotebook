<h2><a name="_Carnality"></a>Carnality </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Carnality is the believer in a state of sin where the
soul is under the control of the old sin nature. The old sin nature is the
source of temptation to sin, but the source of sin is your volition. After
salvation, the believer continues to possess their old sin nature and
therefore, continues to sin. 1 John 1:8; Rom. 5:12; Rom. 7:14-15.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves and
the truth is not in us.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 John 1:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world,
and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned—”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
5:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For we know that the Law is spiritual, but I am of flesh, sold
into bondage to sin. For what I am doing, I do not understand; for I am not
practicing what I would like to do, but I am doing the very thing I hate.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
7:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><img width=500 height=350 src="Carnality1.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The old sin nature is deceitful and desperately sick.
Jer. 17:9; Psalms 5:2-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>““The heart is more deceitful than all else And is desperately
sick; Who can understand it?”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jeremiah 17:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Heed the sound of my cry for help, my King and my God, For to
You I pray. In the morning, O LORD, You will hear my voice; In the morning I
will order my prayer to You and eagerly watch. For You are not a God who takes
pleasure in wickedness; No evil dwells with You. The boastful shall not stand
before Your eyes; You hate all who do iniquity.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 5:2-5,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer’s soul in carnality is under the control of
the old sin nature. Rom. 7:18-20; 1 Cor. 3:1-3; 1 Cor. 5. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my
flesh; for the willing is present in me, but the doing of the good is not. For
the good that I want, I do not do, but I practice the very evil that I do not
want. But if I am doing the very thing I do not want, I am no longer the one
doing it, but sin which dwells in me.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 7:18-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual men,
but as to men of flesh, as to infants in Christ. I gave you milk to drink, not
solid food; for you were not yet able to receive it. Indeed, even now you are
not yet able, for you are still fleshly. For since there is jealousy and strife
among you, are you not fleshly, and are you not walking like mere men?”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Corinthians 3:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The old sin nature frustrates bona fide production in the
life of the believer. Rom. 7:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For while we were in the flesh, the sinful passions, which
were aroused by the Law, were at work in the members of our body to bear fruit
for death.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 7:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The old sin nature is acquired genetically from the
father’s chromosomes. Psalms 51:5; Rom. 5:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world,
and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned—”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
5:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, And in sin my mother
conceived me.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 51:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are four main characteristics that make up the old
sin nation. The Area of Weakness produces sins. The Area of Strength produces
human good. The Lust Patterns produce various types of lusts and the Trends
produce Legalism / Asceticism and Antinomianism / Lasciviousness.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><img width=500 height=410 id="Picture 1"
src="Carnality2.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Our resurrected body will be exactly like that of the
resurrected humanity of Jesus Christ and will not have an old sin nature. 1
John 3:1-2; Phil. 3:20-21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“See how great a love the Father has bestowed on us, that we
would be called children of God; and such we are. For this reason the world
does not know us, because it did not know Him. Beloved, now we are children of
God, and it has not appeared as yet what we will be. We know that when He
appears, we will be like Him, because we will see Him just as He is.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
John 3:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For our citizenship is in heaven, from which also we eagerly
wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ; who will transform the body of our
humble state into conformity with the body of His glory, by the exertion of the
power that He has even to subject all things to Himself.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Philippians
3:20-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The best that the old sin nature can produce is human
good works that God’s absolute righteousness considers “like a filthy garment”
and completely unacceptable. Isaiah 64:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For all of us have become like one who is unclean, And all our
righteous deeds are like a filthy garment; And all of us wither like a leaf,
And our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah 64:6,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The old sin nature has many facets. We are not to let our
sin nature control our soul, but to overcome it through confession of sin to
God the Father resulting in the filling of the Holy Spirit where the Holy
Spirit then controls our soul. Rom. 6:12-14; Col. 2:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you
obey its lusts, and do not go on presenting the members of your body to sin as
instruments of unrighteousness; but present yourselves to God as those alive
from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God. For sin
shall not be master over you, for you are not under law but under grace.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans
6:12-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and in Him you were also circumcised with a circumcision made
without hands, in the removal of the body of the flesh by the circumcision of
Christ;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Colossians 2:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Carnal Christian </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians, there are at least 63 different sins
mentioned. The Corinthians were Sin, Inc., but they were believers. More spoke
in tongues, did miracles, and manifested other supernatural sign gifts than any
other church in the New Testament, but they were the worst group pictured in
any New Testament local church. 1 Cor. 3:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual
men, but as to men of flesh, as to infants in Christ.&quot;  (1 Corinthians
3:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul is saying here; “I couldn’t write to you as
believers in fellowship (spiritual), but as believers out of fellowship
(carnal).” A believer is spiritual when the Holy Spirit controls their soul. A
believer is carnal when the old sin nature controls. We should recognize the
existence of the old sin nature for two reasons. We should recognize our own
carnality and not be shocked when some other believer steps out of line in some
area of sin that bothers us. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the latter one, you may be tempted to say, “He’s
probably not a Christian at all.” Perhaps you are discussing another believer
and you say, “You know Charlie Brown, do you think he is a Christian?” “Well
yes, I think so.” “Well, yesterday I saw Charlie Brown doing so and so and I
just wondered. Well, I don’t know, maybe he just has a head belief and not a
heart belief.” This conversation is pure nonsense! In the first place, there is
no such thing as a head belief and not a heart belief. There can be only head
knowledge without acting upon it, but not the latter.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Carnality can be anything from mental attitude sins, to
sins of the tongue such as white lies and exaggerations. Even thinking human
viewpoint is sin. The carnal Christian is handicapped when they can’t take in
Bible doctrine because they are daydreaming, planning what they will do after
the Bible class, or thinking about tomorrow, dreaming, or even sleeping. 1 Cor.
3:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I gave you milk to drink, not solid food; for you were
not yet able to receive it. Indeed, even now you are not yet able,&quot;  (1
Corinthians 3:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In fact, 1 Corinthians 3:3 indicates that the Corinthian
believer is characterized by strife, envy, and division. The believer out of
fellowship “walks as men.” This means they think, walk, and act like an
unbeliever. The carnal believer cannot be distinguished from an unbeliever.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;for you are still fleshly. For since there is jealousy
and strife among you, are you not fleshly, and are you not walking like mere
men?&quot;  (1 Corinthians 3:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>By the way, in Matthew 7:20, “you will know them by their
fruits” refers to false, unsaved, apostate teachers and cannot be applied to
the carnal Christian.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; &quot;So then, you will know them by their fruits.
&quot;  (Matthew 7:20, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Here is what often happens. A believer thinks they are
pretty great because they do not smoke, drink, dance, play cards, or go to the
movies. Fine. But they may be shot through with mental attitude sins, sins of
criticism, maligning, bitterness, griping, worry and so on. Today in Christian
circles, a believer can be guilty of these mental attitude sins and sins of the
tongue and get away with it. The average believer today describes a few moral
sins and some taboos and feels that runs the gamut of sin, but it does not! Not
at all.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What do you feel are the seven worst sins a believer can
commit? Make a list. Compare your list to Proverbs 6:16-19. Go through these
individually. Here are described mental attitude sins, sins of the tongue such
as gossip, maligning, etc. About the only one you probably had on your list was
murder. The worst sins are mental attitude sins. And sometimes pastors,
deacons, Sunday School teachers can be shot through with these mental attitude
sins. The teaching of vocabulary and abbreviations is important for taking
notes in Bible class.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;There are six things which the LORD hates, Yes, seven
which are an abomination to Him: Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, And hands that
shed innocent blood, A heart that devises wicked plans, Feet that run rapidly
to evil, A false witness who utters lies, And one who spreads strife among
brothers.&quot;  (Proverbs 6:16-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 7:11-15, Paul is describing the believer out of
fellowship. In Romans 7:11, note that “sin” in the singular refers to the old
sin nature. Then for the phrase, “the commandment,” this refers to the moral
commandments (The Ten Commandments) of the Mosaic Law. There are three parts to
the Mosaic Law: the moral commandments (The Ten Commandments) which reveal sin,
the ceremonial commandments which revealed Christ (offerings, feasts,
priesthood, tabernacle), and the civil commandments which revealed the walk,
the way of life to protect Israel as a nation.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;for sin, taking an opportunity through the commandment,
deceived me and through it killed me.&quot;  (Romans 7:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul is saying that the Law is good, but it brings out
evil in me, it exposes my sin. Rom. 7:12-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So then, the Law is holy, and the commandment is holy and
righteous and good. Therefore did that which is good become a cause of death
for me? May it never be! Rather it was sin, in order that it might be shown to
be sin by effecting my death through that which is good, so that through the
commandment sin would become utterly sinful.&quot;  (Romans 7:12-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 7:14, ”I am of flesh” is the perfect tense and
means that before I was a believer, the old sin nature ran my life and this
principle is still operating after I became a Christian.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For we know that the Law is spiritual, but I am of flesh,
sold into bondage to sin.&quot;  (Romans 7:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 7:15, Paul is saying, “the old sin nature is
running me.” He doesn’t want to be this way. He desires to live for God and
glorify Him, to serve Him, to please Him. Paul is a believer. He has eternal
life. His position in Christ is perfect. He still has his permanent union with
Jesus Christ and always will have, but he is out of fellowship due to sin with
his old sin nature controlling his soul.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For what I am doing, I do not understand; for I am not
practicing what I would like to do, but I am doing the very thing I
hate.&quot;  (Romans 7:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A Romans 7:15 translation: “For that which works out of
me (sin nature on the inside works out), I don’t understand it (I’ve been
born-again, I’ve been given divine grace resources, but instead of good things
working out, bad things come out), for what I desire (desires to live for
Christ) that I do not practice, but what I hate, that I keep on doing.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Pattern of Carnality</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Being out of fellowship is called carnality and often
follows a pattern. Examples of and terms used for carnality can be found in
James. Lack of wisdom in James 1:5. Vacillating in James 1:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who
gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to
him.&quot;  (James 1:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; being a double-minded man, unstable in all his
ways.&quot;  (James 1:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Blames his temptations on God in James 1:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Let no one say when he is tempted, &quot;I am being
tempted by God&quot;; for God cannot be tempted by evil, and He Himself does
not tempt anyone.&quot;  (James 1:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Misunderstands grace in James 1:17. Involves others in
his carnality in James 1:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Every good thing given and every perfect gift is from
above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation
or shifting shadow.&quot;  (James 1:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot; This you know, my beloved brethren. But everyone must be
quick to hear, slow to speak and slow to anger;&quot;  (James 1:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Production at a minimum, a hearer of the Word only,
highly forgetful. James 1:22-25. Impressed with the personality in James
2:1-13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But prove yourselves doers of the word, and not merely
hearers who delude themselves. For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a
doer, he is like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror; for once he
has looked at himself and gone away, he has immediately forgotten what kind of
person he was. But one who looks intently at the perfect law, the law of
liberty, and abides by it, not having become a forgetful hearer but an
effectual doer, this man will be blessed in what he does.&quot;  (James
1:22-25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Plagued by apparent doctrinal controversies in James
2:14-20. Manifold sins of the tongue in James 3. Improper motivations such as
strife and envy in James 4. Need for completion, incomplete, impatient in James
5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;What use is it, my brethren, if someone says he has faith
but he has no works? Can that faith save him? If a brother or sister is without
clothing and in need of daily food, and one of you says to them, &quot;Go in
peace, be warmed and be filled,&quot; and yet you do not give them what is
necessary for their body, what use is that? Even so faith, if it has no works,
is dead, being by itself. But someone may well say, &quot;You have faith and I
have works; show me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith
by my works.&quot; You believe that God is one. You do well; the demons also
believe, and shudder. But are you willing to recognize, you foolish fellow,
that faith without works is useless?&quot;  (James 2:14-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The personal need of confession of sin may be experienced
in the life of a believer in one of the following ways. Through a loss of peace
– Phil. 4:6-7. Through severe divine discipline - Heb. 12:6. Through a guilty
conscience - Heb. 13:18. Through sorrow - Psalms 32.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and
supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the
peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, will guard your hearts and
your minds in Christ Jesus.&quot;  (Philippians 4:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;FOR THOSE WHOM THE LORD LOVES HE DISCIPLINES, AND HE
SCOURGES EVERY SON WHOM HE RECEIVES.&quot;&quot;  (Hebrews 12:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Pray for us, for we are sure that we have a good
conscience, desiring to conduct ourselves honorably in all things.&quot; 
(Hebrews 13:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The person needing to get back into fellowship may not
even think they are out of fellowship. 1 John 1:6; 1 John 2:9-10; 1 John 1:8; 2
Peter 1:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk
in the darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth;&quot;  (1 John 1:6,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The one who says he is in the Light and yet hates his
brother is in the darkness until now. The one who loves his brother abides in
the Light and there is no cause for stumbling in him.&quot;  (1 John 2:9-10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves
and the truth is not in us.&quot;  (1 John 1:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For he who lacks these qualities is blind or
short-sighted, having forgotten his purification from his former sins.&quot; 
(2 Peter 1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The person needing to get back into fellowship may try
many things as substitutes for the correct biblical confession of sin such as
sorrow or weeping under the guise of “godly sorrow.” Prayer and reading of the
Word. Rededicating their lives to the Lord. Making it up to God by tithing or
self-denial of some desire or pleasure. Attending church or getting back to
listening to recordings of past Bible classes.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>False Victory for the Christian</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A believer may say, “I don’t have victory, the internal
source of sin is my old sin nature, I’ll have a super-duper experience and
eradicate it. An eradicated old sin nature will allow me to be a stellar
witness.” This is a false premise. The only source of sin is your volition. 1
John 1:8.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves
and the truth is not in us.&quot;  (1 John 1:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 John 1:8, “sin” is in the singular and refers to the
old sin nature. “We are deceiving ourselves” means we can never deny the
presence of the old sin nature because it is in our bodies. “The truth is not
in us” means that we are saved, but there is no Bible doctrine in the right
lobe of our soul. There are people around who believe that their old sin nature
has been eradicated. However, it is a false means of victory.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The incorrect conclusion from 1 John 1:10 is that since
my sins were cleansed at the Cross, and I have a “second blessing” type of
experience, then I no longer commit personal acts of sin. 1 John 1:10 points
out the fallacy, “If we say that we have not sinned (plural, committed personal
thoughts or acts of sin), we make Him a liar, and His Word is not in us.” </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar and
His word is not in us.&quot;  (1 John 1:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Though a believer, we have made the issue a false one
because of the absence of God’s Word in the right lobe of our soul. The
following passages indicate that a genuine believer sins. 1 Cor. 3:1-3; Rom.
7:11-15; Heb. 12:1-2; 1 John 2:1; 1 John 1:8-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual
men, but as to men of flesh, as to infants in Christ. I gave you milk to drink,
not solid food; for you were not yet able to receive it. Indeed, even now you
are not yet able, for you are still fleshly. For since there is jealousy and
strife among you, are you not fleshly, and are you not walking like mere
men?&quot;  (1 Corinthians 3:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses
surrounding us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so
easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before
us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the
joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at
the right hand of the throne of God.” (Hebrews 12:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;My little children, I am writing these things to you so
that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father,
Jesus Christ the righteous;&quot;  (1 John 2:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves
and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and
righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all
unrighteousness.&quot;  (1 John 1:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Divine Discipline Due to Unconfessed Sin</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are several degrees of chastisement or divine
discipline. When a believer gets out of fellowship, they lose their peace and
production. They may be “scourged” as in Hebrews 12:6, or they may suffer a far
more serious form of divine discipline called the Sin Unto Death where God
removing a believer prematurely for disciplinary reasons. This ultimate form of
divine discipline only occurs after a long time of the believer not responding
to ever more serious divine discipline without confessing sins. The Sin Unto
Death is a fearful doctrine. 1 John 5:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;FOR THOSE WHOM THE LORD LOVES HE DISCIPLINES, AND HE
SCOURGES EVERY SON WHOM HE RECEIVES.&quot;&quot;  (Hebrews 12:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If anyone sees his brother committing a sin not leading
to death, he shall ask and God will for him give life to those who commit sin
not leading to death. There is a sin leading to death; I do not say that he
should make request for this.&quot;  (1 John 5:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You can trace the doctrine of the Sin Unto Death by
looking at David’s sin in 2 Samuel 11 and its effect in Psalms 38. David was
under the Sin Unto Death. Saul was also. David, however, confessed sin
biblically in 2 Samuel 12. Then, the sentence of premature physical death was
lifted. Saul, however, did not confess his sins and died by the Sin Unto Death.
However, he still went to Paradise. 1 Sam. 28:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Moreover the LORD will also give over Israel along
with you into the hands of the Philistines, therefore tomorrow you and your
sons will be with me. Indeed the LORD will give over the army of Israel into
the hands of the Philistines!&quot;&quot;  (1 Samuel 28:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 5, a believer is sentenced with the Sin
Unto Death, but he confesses sin biblically in between the time 1 Corinthians
and 2 Corinthians was written. 2 Cor. 2:6-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Sufficient for such a one is this punishment which was
inflicted by the majority, so that on the contrary you should rather forgive
and comfort him, otherwise such a one might be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.
Wherefore I urge you to reaffirm your love for him. For to this end also I
wrote, so that I might put you to the test, whether you are obedient in all
things.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 2:6-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 Corinthians 11:30 also mentions the Sin Unto Death.
This is committed by believers who habitually stay out of fellowship and refuse
to get back into fellowship. But the severity of divine discipline often brings
the believer around just short of death and when they confesses sin biblically,
then they are immediately in fellowship once again. The time spent out of
fellowship was wasted time as far as spiritual production is concerned. See
category on <a href="#_D-The_Sin_Unto">The Sin Unto Death</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For this reason many among you are weak and sick, and a
number sleep.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 11:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Example of Delaying Confession of Sin </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Consider the following illustration. A guy is driving his
car to work and he is a believer. Along the way, he is waiting for a red light
to change. He is in fellowship, but getting a little edgy as the time to be at
work is getting near. He wants to make it to work on time. He glances
diagonally across the intersection to see when the cross-traffic light switches
to caution and is ready to hit the gas when his light turns green. But he get
his signals switched, hits the gas and runs into the back of the car ahead of
him. The other driver jumps out and he jumps out. Both drivers lose their
tempers and just before they come to blows, the police arrive. The police break
it up, insurance information is exchanged, one citation is written to the
believer with the quick gas pedal. The traffic laws in that city state that
fault is the driver who hits another car in the rear-end. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Finally, the believer gets back into his car and takes
off, but he is seething! He is really mad. He still blames that other idiot
driver in front for not moving fast enough off the line when the light turned
green. As he continues on to work, he mentally rehashes the whole series of
events a thousand times and is still mad and won’t admit that he was at fault.
He broke the traffic laws, but still won’t admit that it was fair. He arrives
late for work and is in a really bad mood. He stays miserable and ill-tempered
the whole day. Finally, in the late afternoon, he is willing to admit that he
was at fault and was too quick on the gas and didn’t keep his eye on the car in
front just as he had been taught by his father and the driver’s education
teacher way back in high school. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He finally admits that he needs to use 1 John 1:9 and
gets back into fellowship with the Lord. He named the mental attitude sins of
losing his temper, hating the other driver, not really liking what the
policeman did to him, railing against the injustice of the traffic laws, and
the not so nice mental attitude sins toward his co-workers who were looking at
him is a strange way. Those are all the sins he can remember and names them to
God the Father. At that instant, he is forgiven and cleansed from all of the
other sins he forgot about (all righteousness). God, in His perfect grace,
always does the same thing during confession of sin. That’s grace. Name the
sins you know and He does the rest. </p>
