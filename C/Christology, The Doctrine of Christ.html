<h2>Christology, The Doctrine of Christ </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All divine names and titles apply to Christ. He is called
God, Jehovah, Lord, God over all, The Mighty God, Lord of lords, The Great God,
and King of kings. All divine attributes are ascribed to Him such as
Sovereignty, Love, Omnipresence, Righteousness, Eternal Life, Omnipotence,
Justice, Omniscience, Immutability, and Veracity. He is the Creator and upholds
the universe with the word of His power. All things are created by Him. By Him
all things exist. Heb. 1:3;  John 1:1-5; 1 John 1:1-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He is the radiance of His glory and the exact
representation of His nature, and upholds all things by the word of His power.
When He had made purification of sins, He sat down at the right hand of the
Majesty on high,” (Hebrews 1:3, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and
the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came into being
through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being that has come into
being. In Him was life, and the life was the Light of men. The Light shines in
the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 1:1-5,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“What was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have
seen with our eyes, what we have looked at and touched with our hands,
concerning the Word of Life— and the life was manifested, and we have seen and
testify and proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was
manifested to us— what we have seen and heard we proclaim to you also, so that
you too may have fellowship with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the
Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ. These things we write, so that our joy
may be made complete. This is the message we have heard from Him and announce
to you, that God is Light, and in Him there is no darkness at all. If we say
that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do
not practice the truth; but if we walk in the Light as He Himself is in the
Light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son
cleanses us from all sin. If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving
ourselves and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, He is faithful
and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all
unrighteousness. If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar and His
word is not in us.” (1 John 1:1-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He is the object of all worship as far as His creatures
are concerned. Angels worship Him. There is Christian sentiment, reverence,
love, faith, and devotion. To Him, men and angels are responsible for their
character and conduct. He requires that men should honor Him as they honor the
Father and that they should exercise the same faith in Him that they do in God
the Father.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He declares that He and the Father are one, and that
those that have seen Him have seen the Father also. He calls all men unto Him
and promises to forgive their sins, to send them the Holy Spirit, to give rest
and peace, to raise them up at the last day, and to give them eternal life at
the moment of salvation. God is not more than, cannot promise more than, or do
more than Christ is said to be, to promise, and to do. He has, therefore, been
the Christian’s God from the beginning, in all ages, and in all places!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ had to be true humanity so He could become
our Savior, our Mediator, our High-Priest, and our King. 1 Tim. 2:5; Heb.
5:7-9; Heb. 2:9-12; Luke 1:31-32.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For there is one God, and one mediator also between God and
men, the man Christ Jesus,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Timothy 2:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“In the days of His flesh, He offered up both prayers and
supplications with loud crying and tears to the One able to save Him from
death, and He was heard because of His piety. Although He was a Son, He learned
obedience from the things which He suffered. And having been made perfect, He
became to all those who obey Him the source of eternal salvation,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews
5:7-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But we do see Him who was made for a little while lower than
the angels, namely, Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory
and honor, so that by the grace of God He might taste death for everyone. For
it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things, and through whom are all
things, in bringing many sons to glory, to perfect the author of their
salvation through sufferings. For both He who sanctifies and those who are
sanctified are all from one Father; for which reason He is not ashamed to call
them brethren, saying, “I WILL PROCLAIM YOUR NAME TO MY BRETHREN, IN THE MIDST
OF THE CONGREGATION I WILL SING YOUR PRAISE.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 2:9-12,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son,
and you shall name Him Jesus. “He will be great and will be called the Son of
the Most High; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Luke
1:31-32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Hypostatic Union is defined as undiminished deity and
true humanity united in one person forever. Phil. 2:6-8, Rom. 1:2-5, Heb.
2:14-15, Gal. 4:4-5, John 1:1-14, Rom. 9:5, 1 John 1:1-3. See category on the <a
href="#_D-Hypostatic_Union_of_1">Hypostatic Union of Jesus Christ</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard
equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form
of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men. Being found in
appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of
death, even death on a cross.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Philippians 2:6-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood, He
Himself likewise also partook of the same, that through death He might render
powerless him who had the power of death, that is, the devil, and might free
those who through fear of death were subject to slavery all their lives.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews
2:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His
Son, born of a woman, born under the Law, so that He might redeem those who
were under the Law, that we might receive the adoption as sons.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Galatians
4:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and
the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came into being
through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being that has come into
being. In Him was life, and the life was the Light of men. The Light shines in
the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.” (John 1:1-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Each member of the Trinity had a part in the resurrection
of Jesus Christ. God the Father acted in Acts 2:24, Acts 13:30, Romans 6:4, and
Ephesians 1:19-20.</p>

<p class=Verses>““But God raised Him up again, putting an end to the agony of
death, since it was impossible for Him to be held in its power.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts
2:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““But God raised Him from the dead;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts 13:30,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore we have been buried with Him through baptism into
death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the
Father, so we too might walk in newness of life.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 6:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us
who believe. These are in accordance with the working of the strength of His
might which He brought about in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead and
seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians
1:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Son acted in John 2:19 and John 10:17-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Jesus answered them, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I
will raise it up.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 2:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““For this reason the Father loves Me, because I lay down My
life so that I may take it again. “No one has taken it away from Me, but I lay
it down on My own initiative. I have authority to lay it down, and I have
authority to take it up again. This commandment I received from My Father.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(John
10:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Holy Spirit acted in 1 Peter 3:18 and Romans
8:1-2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For Christ also died for sins once for all, the just for the
unjust, so that He might bring us to God, having been put to death in the
flesh, but made alive in the spirit;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Peter 3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in
Christ Jesus. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you
free from the law of sin and of death.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Romans 8:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The spheres of Christ’s ministry included the grace
principles in the Mosaic Law, the Kingdom, and the Church. Matt. 5-7; Matt. 13;
Matt. 16; John 14-17.</p>
