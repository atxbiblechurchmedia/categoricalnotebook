<h2><a name="_D-Authority_in_the"></a>Authority in the Local Church</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Pastor’s Responsibilities </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The setting of Acts 20:17-19 is that Paul is eventually
going to end up in Jerusalem. Acts 20:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus so that he
would not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hurrying to be in Jerusalem,
if possible, on the day of Pentecost.&quot;  (Acts 20:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He got within 30 miles of Ephesus and held a pastor’s
conference with all of the pastors of Ephesus (what is now Western Turkey)
attending. These pastors represented about 50-100 homes that were local
churches and possibly 50-100 pastors there for Ephesus which was a large city.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;From Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called to him the
elders of the church. And when they had come to him, he said to them, &quot;You
yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, how I was with you
the whole time, serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and with
trials which came upon me through the plots of the Jews;&quot;  (Acts 20:17-19,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 20:17, “called to him the elders of the church”
refers to the many local churches that made up the church at Ephesus. Three
Greek words refer to a pastor-teacher’s duty. “Elders” is <span lang=EL>πρεσβυ</span>́<span
lang=EL>τερος</span> (presbuteros) and speaks of pastor-teachers. It’s the word
for “old man” and speaks of the authority of the appointment, the ranking
member of a local congregation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 20:28, “overseers” is <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span
lang=EL>πι</span>́<span lang=EL>σκοπος</span> (episkopos) and refers to the
function of the pastor. This work comes from <i>epi</i> - upon or over and <i>scopos</i>
- to observe. Therefore, it means to oversee. The authority of a pastor-teacher
lies in his teaching of Bible doctrine. The responsibility of a pastor is to
feed the congregation the Word daily under the Hermeneutical principle of
Isagogics, Categories and Exegesis (ICE), not to administer programs, not to
keep people active, and not to hustle. He is to study and teach.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock,
among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of
God which He purchased with His own blood.&quot;  (Acts 20:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Shepherd” is <span lang=EL>ποιμαι</span>́<span lang=EL>νω</span>
(poimainō) and means “get rid of the wolves.” The responsibility of a pastor
is to protect the flock. This word emphasizes the gift of pastor-teacher given
by grace to shepherd the flock.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Acts 20:18-21 states the characteristics of the
pastorate. Serving with humility of mind in Acts 20:18 and means to be oriented
to grace, thinking grace, the first floor of the edification complex, grace
orientation. He must have grace thinking and as such he will never have any
illusions about himself.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And when they had come to him, he said to them, &quot;You
yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, how I was with you
the whole time, serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and with
trials which came upon me through the plots of the Jews; how I did not shrink
from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and teaching you publicly
and from house to house, solemnly testifying to both Jews and Greeks of
repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.&quot;  (Acts
20:18-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Acts 20:29-30 indicates the authority of the
pastor-teacher to troubleshoot. However, the pastor must not abuse his
authority. The congregation does not have to worry about whether the pastor
needs divine discipline. The Lord will give him a double dose when needed.1
Peter 5:1-6; 1 Cor. 15:10. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;I know that after my departure savage wolves will
come in among you, not sparing the flock; and from among your own selves men
will arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after
them.&quot;  (Acts 20:29-30, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;shepherd the flock of God among you, exercising oversight
not under compulsion, but voluntarily, according to the will of God; and not
for sordid gain, but with eagerness;&quot;  (1 Peter 5:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace
toward me did not prove vain; but I labored even more than all of them, yet not
I, but the grace of God with me.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 15:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If God does not promote a pastor, a pastor is not
promoted. This is also true of all believers. Joshua 3:7. When the pastor is
promoted, then Isaiah 54:17 applies.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now the LORD said to Joshua, &quot;This day I will begin
to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that just as I have
been with Moses, I will be with you.&quot;  (Joshua 3:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;No weapon that is formed against you will prosper;
And every tongue that accuses you in judgment you will condemn. This is the
heritage of the servants of the LORD, And their vindication is from Me,&quot;
declares the LORD.&quot;  (Isaiah 54:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Acts 20:19, “tears” these are the disappointments and
frustrations of the pastorate. Every pastor ought to have been jilted, received
about five “dear-John” letters from girlfriends and should have about five
years of military service. Then after all the frustrations of military service
and being rejected by girlfriends, they will have no trouble in the pastorate.
There are probably two categories of people who get to see the seamy side of
life more than others, preachers and prostitutes. They see the instability of
man.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and
with trials which came upon me through the plots of the Jews;&quot;  (Acts
20:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Trials” refers to pressures of which many are unique to
the pastorate. Specifically, these were the religious Jews and the legalists.
Today, it is the apostates who tear apart the grace of God, who discredit
confessing sin biblically, who accuse, who lie, who misrepresent, the human
good types and the loud-mouthed women of which every congregation is plagued
from time to time. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>So, Paul is the greatest example of all time of a man who
laid it on the line and did not give up ever and kept true to the principles of
grace. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Orienting to the Authority of Your Pastor-Teacher</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Peter 5:5, “likewise” means in a similar manner. The
congregation has responsibilities just like the pastor has responsibilities.
The most important responsibility is submission to the authority of the pastor
without which you cannot benefit from his ministry. The congregation must
recognize and orient to the authority of their pastor to grow spiritually. 1
Thess. 5:12; Heb. 13:7; Heb. 13:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;You younger men, likewise, be subject to your elders; and
all of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, for GOD IS
OPPOSED TO THE PROUD, BUT GIVES GRACE TO THE HUMBLE.&quot;  (1 Peter 5:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But we request of you, brethren, that you appreciate
those who diligently labor among you, and have charge over you in the Lord and
give you instruction,&quot;  (1 Thessalonians 5:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Remember those who led you, who spoke the word of God to
you; and considering the result of their conduct, imitate their faith.&quot; 
(Hebrews 13:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch
over your souls as those who will give an account. Let them do this with joy
and not with grief, for this would be unprofitable for you.&quot;  (Hebrews
13:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Peter 5:5, the congregation is called “younger” and
is <span lang=EL>νεω</span>́<span lang=EL>τερος</span> (neōteros) in the Greek
and  is a word for subordination. The first part <i>neo</i> means young and the
<i>teros</i> is a comparison suffix. By comparison, you do not have the
authority of the pastor. This is in contrast to the word “elder” which is <span
lang=EL>πρεσβυ</span>́<span lang=EL>τερος</span> (presbuteros). This used to
mean older person, but means one with authority. The congregation is made up of
believer priests assembling in one location and recognizing the authority of
the pastor-teacher.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor-teacher is the authority for two areas. He has
absolute authority regarding policy of the local church. The administrative
authority in the local church resides with the deacon board. The pastor can
stop the deacon board if they get into any policy that is anti-grace. You
cannot have two heads in a local church. The local church cannot have the
deacon board as the highest authority. There cannot be two heads in the home,
in a business, in anything.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Peter 5:5, “be subject” is the aorist middle
imperative of <span lang=EL>υ</span>̔<span lang=EL>ποτα</span>́<span lang=EL>σσω</span><span
lang=EL> </span>(hupotassō) and is the strongest word for subordination to
authority in the New Testament. It was originally a military term, submitting
to the authority of your military officer, to be under their command. This is a
constantive aorist and means that as long as you are in the local church, you
must submit to the pastor of that church. The same word as used of wives
submitting to the authority of their husbands. The middle voice means they are
benefitted by spiritual food, by the daily intake of doctrine and daily
function of the grace apparatus for perception. The imperative mood means this
is a command to all living believers in the Church Age. If you cannot submit to
the authority of one local church, you must to go to a local church where you
can. It is to your advantage to have a pastor-teacher. You are not permitted to
run foot loose and fancy free. Every believer has a right pastor under whose
authority you will grow spiritually.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Peter 5:5, “all of you, clothe yourselves” is the
aorist middle imperative of <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>γκομβο</span>́<span
lang=EL>ομαι</span> (egkomboomai) and means to roll, to band together, to put
garments on. The constantive aorist means to be clothed in the soul, the entire
Christian life, the times when you are together, with all Christian believers.
The middle voice means you are benefitted. The imperative mood means that it is
a command to all believers. “With humility” is grace orientation toward each
other of the same kind. This is what you wear in your soul. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“For God is opposed to the proud” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span
lang=EL>ντιτα</span>́<span lang=EL>σσομαι</span> (antitassomai) and means to be
in line against. He is against the “proud” is <span lang=EL>υ</span>̔<span
lang=EL>περη</span>́<span lang=EL>φανος</span> (huperēphanos) and means to
appear above, to be proud, haughty, to be arrogant, to be anti-grace,
self-righteous, legalistic, have mental attitude sins, ignorant of Bible
doctrine. “But gives grace to the humble” means that God keeps on providing
grace to the grace oriented. This does not mean self-effacement, or hypocrisy,
or standing in poor posture, and trying to take away from self. This is
humility of the soul which is grace orientation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Peter 5:6, “humble yourselves” is the aorist passive
imperative of the verb <span lang=EL>ταπεινο</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(tapeinoō). The constantive aorist means moving toward grace orientation
anytime Bible doctrine is taken in. The passive voice means that any time you
take in Bible doctrine, you receive humility. It is not something you acquire.
It is not a personality pattern. It is not a personality change. There is no
road to humility except through Bible doctrine. The imperative mood means it is
commanded that you function under the grace apparatus for perception and become
grace oriented. Humility is a mental attitude of the soul which you receive
from Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God,
that He may exalt you at the proper time,&quot;  (1 Peter 5:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every person in emotional revolt has some system of
self-effacement. This is not humility. Humbling yourself is not from changing
your appearance, by becoming sloppy, or by neglecting grooming. Humility is not
citing your failures and dumb things to gain rapport from others.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God is not in the business of producing kooks out of
Christians. You never want to have a testimony like, “Once I was normal and now
I am a Christian.” True humility refers to receiving a graced-out mental
attitude from Bible doctrine. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Peter 5:6, “Therefore” is based on Proverbs 3:34.
“Under” is <span lang=EL>υ</span>̔<span lang=EL>πο</span>́ (hupo) and is a
preposition of subordination. You cannot have grace humility without the
recognition of authority. “Mighty” is the adjective <span lang=EL>κραταιο</span>́<span
lang=EL>ς</span> (krataios) and means a ruling system or power and refers to
Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Though He scoffs at the scoffers, Yet He gives grace to
the afflicted.&quot;  (Proverbs 3:34, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Hand” is an anthropopathism and means to assign a human
characteristic so we can understand God’s attitude at any point. God doesn’t
have hands. He is a Spirit. Anthropopathisms are used in Proverbs 8:10-36
referring to the hand of God as the source of divine provision, the giving hand
is extended to the human race. The hand of God is also used in Psalms 19:1
referring to creation, in Psalms 22:16 referring to salvation, in Isaiah 41:10
referring to His grace provision, and in Psalms 37:24 and John 10:28 referring
to eternal security.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For the choir director. A Psalm of David. The heavens are
telling of the glory of God; And their expanse is declaring the work of His
hands.&quot;  (Psalms 19:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For dogs have surrounded me; A band of evildoers has
encompassed me; They pierced my hands and my feet.&quot;  (Psalms 22:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;'Do not fear, for I am with you; Do not anxiously look
about you, for I am your God. I will strengthen you, surely I will help you,
Surely I will uphold you with My righteous right hand.'&quot;  (Isaiah 41:10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When he falls, he will not be hurled headlong, Because
the LORD is the One who holds his hand.&quot;  (Psalms 37:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and I give eternal life to them, and they will never
perish; and no one will snatch them out of My hand.&quot;  (John 10:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Peter 5:6, “that He may exalt you at the proper
time,” means that only through Bible doctrine does God promote. There is no
self-promotion or group promotion where one is promoted in the eyes of the
people. In 1 Samuel 16:7, “the Lord looks at the heart” means that looks at
what is in the right lobe of the believer’s soul. David’s promotion came
through learning and applying Bible doctrine resulting in his spiritual growth.
</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But the LORD said to Samuel, &quot;Do not look at his
appearance or at the height of his stature, because I have rejected him; for
God sees not as man sees, for man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD
looks at the heart.&quot;&quot;  (1 Samuel 16:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Exalt” is the aorist active subjunctive of <span
lang=EL>υ</span>̔<span lang=EL>ψο</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (hupsoō) and
means to elevate, to promote, to exalt. The aorist tense refers to the time
when a believer has maximum doctrine in their right lobe. This is a culminative
aorist and means that after you have taken in Bible doctrine, you have an edification
complex of the soul. This is the point of promotion.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The active voice means that God always does the
promoting. He does it on the basis of His omniscience and His ability to read
your soul. The subjunctive mood indicates that the promotion is potential,
depending upon Bible doctrine and the key is grace orientation. God cannot and
will not promote a non-grace believer. Joshua 3:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now the LORD said to Joshua, &quot;This day I will begin
to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that just as I have
been with Moses, I will be with you.&quot;  (Joshua 3:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Proper time” is <span lang=EL>εν</span> plus the
locative case (sphere) of <span lang=EL>καιρο</span>́<span lang=EL>ς</span>
(kairos) and occurs in our time on earth. We’re all promoted in eternity. This
is the point when we have taken in enough doctrine in the daily function of grace
apparatus for perception, grace orientation to the point where God can trust
you with authority. No one can use authority until they become authority
oriented. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/A/Authority%20of%20Pastor-Teacher.html">Authority of the
Pastor-Teacher</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Follow the Dictates of Psalms 37</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 37:1, “Do not fret” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>חרה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(chârâh) and means to glow, to melt, burn, dry up, to
blaze, to be incensed, to be very angry. It actually means to burn with the
heat of jealousy, to vie with a rival. The possessiveness of man is turned into
jealousy. He is turned into a vicious competitor as in the animal world in
everything he does! “Evildoers” is  <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>רָעע</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>(raa). “Envious” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>קנא</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(qânâ') and means
to be jealous, jealousy offering. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;A Psalm of David. Do not fret because of evildoers, Be
not envious toward wrongdoers.&quot;  (Psalms 37:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 37:3, “Trust in the Lord” is  <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>בּטח</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(bâṭach) and means to be bold, decisive,
and to slam down an opponent like a wrestler pins his opponent. “Do” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>עָשָׂה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(asah) and means to manufacture something
out of something. “Good” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>טוֹב</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(tob) and means
divine good. “Dwell in the land” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>שׁכן</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>(shâkan) and means to permanently reside in the land, even means to
rest. “Cultivate” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>רָעָה</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(raah) and is the
word for tending a flock, to be shepherding. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Trust in the LORD and do good; Dwell in the land and
cultivate faithfulness.&quot;  (Psalms 37:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 37:4, “Delight” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL

dir=LTR></span> </span>(‛ânag) and means to be soft, or pliable, used for

dir=LTR></span> </span>(gâlal) and means to roll, to trust, to seek occasion.
It means to roll your burdens on the Lord, to put your issue of life in His
hands. He will then promote you. In Psalms 37:6, “He will bring forth your
righteousness” means He will promote you publicly. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Commit your way to the LORD, Trust also in Him, and He
will do it.&quot;  (Psalms 37:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He will bring forth your righteousness as the light And
your judgment as the noonday.&quot;  (Psalms 37:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 37:7, “Rest” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>דּמם</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(dâmam) and means to cease from your own devices and
techniques, gimmicks, what you think are the solutions. To stop what you are
doing and let the Lord mold your thinking. “Wait patiently” is <span lang=HE

lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(chı̂yl) and means to twist, to whirl, to
dance, to wait. In Isaiah 40:31, “to fret” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL

dir=LTR></span> </span>(qâvâh) and means to bind, to twist. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Rest in the LORD and wait patiently for Him; Do not fret
because of him who prospers in his way, Because of the man who carries out
wicked schemes.&quot;  (Psalms 37:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Yet those who wait for the LORD Will gain new strength;
They will mount up with wings like eagles, They will run and not get tired,
They will walk and not become weary.&quot;  (Isaiah 40:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 37:8, “Cease” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>רפה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(râphâh) and means to slacken, to abate, to forsake. “Anger”

dir=LTR></span> </span>('aph) and means the nose or nostril and refers to the
face getting red, the rapid breathing in passion, to breathe hard, to be
enraged against the evildoer! “Forsake” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>עָזַב</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(azab) and means to loosen, relinquish,
permit, refuse, leave. “Wrath” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>חמא</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (chêmâ')
and means to be hot, heat, anger, poison (from it fever), hot displeasure,
indignation.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Cease from anger and forsake wrath; Do not fret; it leads
only to evildoing.&quot;  (Psalms 37:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Consider the conclusions of Psalm 37:9. The humble will
inherit the land. “Inheriting” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>ירשׁ</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>(yârêsh) and means to occupy by driving out previous tenants, and
possessing in their place, to seize, to expel, to impoverish, to ruin.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For evildoers will be cut off, But those who wait for the
LORD, they will inherit the land.&quot;  (Psalms 37:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 37:11, “Will delight themselves in abundant
prosperity” is the prosperity of believers in peace, in spiritual maturity. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But the humble will inherit the land And will delight
themselves in abundant prosperity.&quot;  (Psalms 37:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The little of the mature believer will be more than the
wealth of the wicked. Psalms 37:16.</p>

<p class=Verses> &quot;Better is the little of the righteous Than the abundance
of many wicked.&quot;  (Psalms 37:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The humble will have their financial obligations taken
care of. The humble will not be destroyed by the enemy, when they stay with
Bible doctrine. Psalms 37:25.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I have been young and now I am old, Yet I have not seen
the righteous forsaken Or his descendants begging bread.&quot;  (Psalms 37:25,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Procedure for Disciplining an Erring Pastor</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Lord puts the erring pastor under double divine
discipline. Double honor in reverse is double discipline. 1 Tim. 5:17; James
3:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The elders who rule well are to be considered worthy of
double honor, especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching.&quot; 
(1 Timothy 5:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Let not many of you become teachers, my brethren, knowing
that as such we will incur a stricter judgment.&quot;  (James 3:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The deacon board is responsible for administering
discipline. I am speaking of categorically oriented boards. When a man
jettisons Bible doctrine, he has no authority. His authority comes from Bible
doctrine. Then a proper biblical procedure is to be followed. 1 Tim. 3:2; 1
Tim. 5. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;An overseer, then, must be above reproach, the husband of
one wife, temperate, prudent, respectable, hospitable, able to teach,&quot;  (1
Timothy 3:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To guarantee objectivity, two or three of the proven,
mature believers must have witnessed (heard or observed) the sin (false
doctrine, overt activity). In 1 Timothy 5:19, “accusation” is <span lang=EL>κατηγορι</span>́<span
lang=EL>α</span> (katēgoria) from <i>kata</i> (down) and <i>agora</i> (a place
of public speaking). This is a trial situation. The word accusation is
referring to an orderly public tribunal held in a local church. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Do not receive an accusation against an elder except on
the basis of two or three witnesses.&quot;  (1 Timothy 5:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pastor explains his position or gives his defense
before a small group of two or three which is an idiom for the board of
deacons. This is not before the congregation. They will “admonish” him. This is
<span lang=EL>νουθεσι</span>́<span lang=EL>α</span> (nouthesia) and means to
put in mind. This is a verbal warning. Titus 3:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Reject a factious man after a first and second
warning,&quot;  (Titus 3:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Then if this does not straighten up the matter, there is
another warning. If this doesn’t straighten out the erring pastor, then 1 Timothy
5:20 is true. “Rebuke before all” meaning the whole congregation. The word
rebuke is <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span lang=EL>λε</span>́<span lang=EL>γχω</span>
(elegchō). Although Timothy did the rebuking here, it would be the duty of the
chairman of the deacon board. Obviously they are sinning. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Those who continue in sin, rebuke in the presence of all,
so that the rest also will be fearful of sinning.&quot;  (1 Timothy 5:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>By this time, the pastor-teacher is out of the ministry
and his resignation should be in hand. If he still is obstinate, then the
congregation should vote him out which is a constitutional provision rather
than a doctrinal provision.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Titus 3:11, it is obvious that the individual is
subverted – the perfect passive indicative of <span lang=EL>ε</span>̓<span
lang=EL>κστρε</span>́<span lang=EL>φω</span> (ekstrephō). He is a
troublemaker, a promoter of factions. He is against the mind of Christ, Bible
doctrine. “Being self-condemned” is <span lang=EL>αυ</span>̓<span lang=EL>τοκατα</span>́<span
lang=EL>κριτος</span> (autokatakritos) and means literally, you become a critic
against yourself. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;knowing that such a man is perverted and is sinning,
being self-condemned.&quot;  (Titus 3:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Training Men For the Ministry</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Men training for the ministry should attend Bible class
under the pastor-teacher at least once per day. If you have the spiritual gift
of pastor-teacher or evangelist, it is compulsory to master the original
languages. You need to be exhibiting a strong evidence of positive volition and
a strong, tough, consistent mental attitude.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>No evangelist can function in his spiritual gift as a
private. His spiritual gift makes him a general and as such, he must be
conditioned. No pastor-teacher can function in his spiritual gift without
showing evidence of being a shepherd (a leader of men) and a teacher (a
communicator of Bible doctrine).</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You need to show evidence that you are a man’s man with
maturity and the filling of the Holy Spirit so necessary to minister in these
days of widespread apostacy. The standard is low today. Isaiah 3. The need is
for divine wisdom. The need is for obedience with a strong positive volition
that says Bible doctrine is first priority. There is a need for power and
influence and to develop the doctrine of desires.</p>
