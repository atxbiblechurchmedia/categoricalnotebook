<h2><a name="_Crowns"></a><a name="_D-Crowns"></a>Crowns</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Crowns are eternal rewards given by Jesus Christ to
resurrected believers and are indicative of reward for the believer who has
logged time in fellowship and has operated as unto the Lord.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Crown of Righteousness</b> is related to
governmental rulership in heaven and is open to all believers for faithfulness
in their spiritual lives and consistency in learning and applying Bible
doctrine. This reward seems to be related to a believer who possesses a
completed edification complex of the soul with a large amount of Bible doctrine
in their right lobe. 2 Tim. 4:7-8.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I
have kept the faith; in the future there is laid up for me the crown of
righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that
day; and not only to me, but also to all who have loved His appearing.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2
Timothy 4:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Crown of Joy</b> refers to believers with spiritual
maturity that have helped other believers based on grace and applying Bible
doctrine in their souls and have also won souls for Christ. Phil. 4:1; 1 Thess.
2:17; 1 Thess. 2:19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, my beloved brethren whom I long to see, my joy and
crown, in this way stand firm in the Lord, my beloved.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Philippians
4:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“But we, brethren, having been taken away from you for a short
while—in person, not in spirit—were all the more eager with great desire to see
your face.”  (1 Thessalonians 2:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For who is our hope or joy or crown of exultation? Is it not
even you, in the presence of our Lord Jesus at His coming?”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Thessalonians 2:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Crown of Glory</b> refers to the believer’s reflection
of or shining forth of the thinking of Jesus Christ in their spiritual life
which glorifies Jesus Christ. This crown specifically refers to eternal rewards
for pastor-teachers with spiritual maturity who have been unfading in their day
by day commitment to studying the Word and to teaching their flock the food of
the soul. 1 Peter 5:2-4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“shepherd the flock of God among you, exercising oversight not
under compulsion, but voluntarily, according to the will of God; and not for
sordid gain, but with eagerness; nor yet as lording it over those allotted to
your charge, but proving to be examples to the flock. And when the Chief
Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Peter 5:2-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Crown of Life</b> is for those who endure terrific
testing and temptation and yet have stayed occupied with the person of Jesus Christ.
This is maximum endurance and use of faith-rest. Rev. 2:10; James 1:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>“‘Do not fear what you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil
is about to cast some of you into prison, so that you will be tested, and you
will have tribulation for ten days. Be faithful until death, and I will give
you the crown of life.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation 2:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Blessed is a man who perseveres under trial; for once he has
been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to
those who love Him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(James 1:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Crown of Thorns</b> does not refer to rewards for Church
Age believers. This crown speaks of the Lord bearing the physical torture and
abuse just prior to His crucifixion. Matt. 27:29.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And after twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on
His head, and a reed in His right hand; and they knelt down before Him and
mocked Him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 27:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Incorruptible Crown</b> refers to the nature of
the spiritual rewards that never fade away or perish like the Roman wreath. 1
Cor. 9:25.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Everyone who competes in the games exercises self-control in
all things. They then do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an
imperishable.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 9:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Many Crowns</b> or diadems as in Revelation 19:12 and
is used to describe our Lord Jesus Christ at His Second Advent.</p>

<p class=Verses>“His eyes are a flame of fire, and on His head are many
diadems; and He has a name written on Him which no one knows except Himself.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation
19:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is not an exhaustive study of crowns or rewards. We
must be concerned about the intake of Bible doctrine. Rewards of this nature are
based on the utilization of the grace of God, not on human merit and human
ability. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/QR/Rewards.html">Rewards.</a></p>
