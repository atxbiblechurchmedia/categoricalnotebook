<h2>Communion, Appreciation of Jesus Christ</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Mark 12:30, our Lord gives us a command to love Him. Through
the filling of the Holy Spirit and growing spiritually, this becomes more and
more a reality in the believer. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;AND YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART,
AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND WITH ALL YOUR MIND, AND WITH ALL YOUR
STRENGTH.'&quot;  (Mark 12:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The filling of the Spirit is the “more excellent way” of
1 Corinthians 12:31. Love here is the production of the believer when in
fellowship. Gal. 5:22-23.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But earnestly desire the greater gifts. And I show you a
still more excellent way.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 12:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,
patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against
such things there is no law.&quot;  (Galatians 5:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The book of 1 Corinthians 13 shows the importance of love
and being in fellowship in the Christian life. In 1 Corinthians 13:1, a
believer speaking out of fellowship is just like a “noisy gong.”  This is used
by peddlers to attract attention to their wares. A believer who exercises a
spiritual gift apart from the filling of the Holy Spirit is like a peddler
calling attention to themselves. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but do
not have love, I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.&quot;  (1
Corinthians 13:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A believer speaking out of fellowship is just like a “clanging
cymbal.” This is the noise made by professional mourners. The believer out of
fellowship using the gift of tongues when bona fide (prior to 70 AD) and
anytime now is like a professional wailer calling attention to himself and not
communicating anything. The exercise of any spiritual gift apart from the
filling of the Spirit is nothingness and uselessness!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual gifts apart from the filling of the Spirit
cannot function. 1 Corinthians 13:2 refers to the function of four of the
temporary spiritual gifts that were being misused in the Corinthian church.
None of these temporary spiritual gifts are functional today.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries
and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do
not have love, I am nothing.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 13:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When you are carnal, your status quo is zero! The principle
here is that when the believer is controlled by the old sin nature, they are
batting 00.00 (human good or sin). When the believer is filled with the Spirit,
they are batting 1000.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is nothingness of spiritual production while out of
fellowship. “If I give all my possessions to feed the poor” refers to
sacrificial giving. “If I surrender my body to be burned” is a martyrdom
illustration. “It profits me nothing” means this is maximum energy in the flesh
and is wood, hay and stubble. 1 Cor. 13:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And if I give all my possessions to feed the poor, and if
I surrender my body to be burned, but do not have love, it profits me
nothing.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 13:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The principle is that unbelievers can produce a lot of
things. When you operate in the energy of the flesh (old sin nature controlling
the soul) you are just competing with the unbeliever on their scale and
probably won’t do nearly as well.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>1 Corinthians 13:4-7 describes the characteristics of
unconditional love for others that can only be realized when filled with the
holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Love is patient, love is kind and is not jealous; love
does not brag and is not arrogant, does not act unbecomingly; it does not seek
its own, is not provoked, does not take into account a wrong suffered, does not
rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; bears all things,
believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.&quot;  (1
Corinthians 13:4-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Positives. “Patient” is patience under pressure, relaxed
mental attitude, mental attitude love - attitude of grace towards others. “Is
kind” is a gracious attitude towards others, giving the other the benefit of
the doubt. “Rejoices with the truth” refers to being positive toward Bible
doctrine. The filling of the Spirit produces a hunger for the Word. “Bears all
things” means you will not betray a confidence. “Believes all things” means the
believer uses faith-rest in all things. “Hopes all things” refers to the
believer’s expectation of the future, dying grace and eternity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Negatives. “Is not jealous” is a mental attitude minus
jealousy, a mental attitude minus spitefulness. “Does not brag” means not
trying to impress others. “Is not arrogant” means to not be stuck on yourself,
self-centered. This is the Greek word for a puffed up frog. “Does not act
unbecomingly” means the believer does not behave dishonorable or indecently and
does not embarrass or belittle others.  “Does not seek its own” is a reference
to lusts of the old sin nature, emotional revolt, being selfish, and wanting
your own way or else. “Is not provoked” means you do not go into a tantrum. “Does
not take into account a wrong suffered” means they have unconditional love
toward those who have done something wrong toward you. “Does not rejoice in
unrighteousness” means they do not rejoice over failure of others, are not
happy when others are in trouble, and have no expression of jealousy.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>During communion, we are to have personal love in the right
lobe of the soul for Christ. This is a rapport love based on the Bible doctrine
in your soul. This love relationship is appreciated in the emotions. You
realize the tremendous love you have for Him because of what He has done for
you.  </p>
