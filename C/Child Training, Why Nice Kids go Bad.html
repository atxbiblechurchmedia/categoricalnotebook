<h2>Child Training, Why Do Nice Kids go Bad?</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Nice kids go bad generally because they have been fed a
substitute for categorical Christianity and Bible doctrine. In some instances,
a child will go wrong with godly parents because of the child’s free will or
volition.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Train up a child in the way he should go, Even when he is old
he will not depart from it.” (Proverbs 22:6, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Nice kids go bad when Christianity is reduced to only
ethics or morality. Unbelievers are to live under morality and the four Divine
Institutions. Nice kids go bad when Christianity is reduced to a human good
system. Human good is not rewarded by God and human good cannot save anyone. Gen.
2 – Gen.11; Eph. 2:8-9. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not
of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one
may boast.” (Ephesians 2:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some unbelievers try to be saved by keeping the Law. With
believers, human good is carnality. Human good comes from the old sin nature.
Rom. 4; Rom. 8:8; Heb. 12:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and those who are in the flesh cannot please God.” (Romans
8:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses
surrounding us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so
easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before
us,” (Hebrews 12:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ignorance of Bible doctrine plus carnality equals human
good. Human good is condemned by God and burned up at the Judgment Seat of
Christ for the believer. 1 Cor. 3:3. </p>

<p class=Verses>“for you are still fleshly. For since there is jealousy and
strife among you, are you not fleshly, and are you not walking like mere men?”
(1 Corinthians 3:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Nice kids go bad when they get involved in religion and
religious programs. So again, the problem is religion. Nice religious kids go
astray. Religion makes you work the flesh to impress God. Religion makes you
work the flesh to keep on impressing God. In contrast, Christianity is a
dynamic personal relationship with Jesus Christ and marvelous fellowship
through the controlling ministry of the Holy Spirit. Christianity is learned on
the basis of Isaiah 28:10-13 and Isaiah 33:6. Order on order, line upon line. Spiritual
growth is based on promises, techniques, doctrines, and principles to put it
one way. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For He says, 'Order on order, order on order, Line on
line, line on line, A little here, a little there.'&quot; Indeed, He will speak
to this people Through stammering lips and a foreign tongue, He who said to
them, &quot;Here is rest, give rest to the weary,&quot; And, &quot;Here is
repose,&quot; but they would not listen. So the word of the LORD to them will
be, &quot;Order on order, order on order, Line on line, line on line, A little
here, a little there,&quot; That they may go and stumble backward, be broken,
snared and taken captive.” (Isaiah 28:10-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He will be the stability of your times, A wealth of
salvation, wisdom and knowledge; The fear of the LORD is his treasure.” (Isaiah
33:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer is to make use of God's promises instead of
worry. Bible doctrine as communicated by a pastor-teacher goes into the mind as
<i>gnosis</i> and spiritual facts. Faith applied to the Bible doctrine taught
causes the Holy Spirit to transfer these facts to the right lobe of the soul as
<i>epignosis</i>. In order for this to operate, the believer must at each stage
be filled with the Holy Spirit, in fellowship. This is the faith-rest life that
produces an inner stability and inner confidence. It really works. See category
on the <a href="#_Grace_Apparatus_For">Grace Apparatus for Perception</a>. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer is to make use of biblical techniques
instead of schemes and gimmicks. They are to make proper use of 1 John 1:9 and
related passages to confess their known sins to God the Father and thereby be
cleansed from all unrighteousness and returned to fellowship with God. </p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The greatest attacks on Christianity today are focused on
the plan of salvation and how the believer regains a state of spirituality
where the Holy Spirit controls the believer’s soul. The believer must
understand the faith rest life. They must learn how to live in the Word through
face-to-face teaching at Bible classes, taking notes during Bible class, listening
to previously recorded Bible doctrine lessons and by applying what is learned
to life’s situations. The believer must gain an understanding how the Holy Spirit
controls the soul. Eph. 5:14-18. See category on <a href="#_D-Spirituality">Spirituality</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason it says, &quot;Awake, sleeper, And arise from
the dead, And Christ will shine on you.&quot; Therefore be careful how you
walk, not as unwise men but as wise, making the most of your time, because the
days are evil. So then do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the
Lord is. And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but be filled
with the Spirit,” (Ephesians 5:14-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer must learn from God the Holy Spirit (Bible
doctrine) how to think divine viewpoint and mature spiritually that results in the
edification structure of the soul. They must learn how to use Bible doctrine in
daily living. If you use the biblical techniques, you are applying Bible
doctrine. Bible doctrine can only be learned through a prepared pastor-teacher
who teaches Expositional, Categorical, and Systematic doctrine. He should be
teaching from the simple to the complex, from the simple basics to the most
detailed analysis. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer should understand the power of prayer. Prayer
is applying faith to the promises of God and directing them to a specific area.
Prayer also involves the Lord Jesus Christ praying for you and interceding for
you and God the Holy Spirit praying for you. You use the word in daily living. Rom.
8. See category on <a href="#_D-Prayer">Prayer</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer should understand the principles of the Word
of God. They need to understand that God's grace always precedes judgment. The
believer needs to understand how to direct their prayers. In that time you can
pray for your loved one who is going astray. The battle is the Lord’s. Where
sin did abound, grace did much more abound. If God be for us, who can be
against us. Greater is He that is in you, than he that is in the world. Rely on
Him, trust Him. 1 Sam. 17:47; Rom. 5:20; Rom. 8:31; 1 John 4:4; Prov. 3:5-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and that all this assembly may know that the LORD does not
deliver by sword or by spear; for the battle is the LORD'S and He will give you
into our hands.&quot;” (1 Samuel 17:47, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“The Law came in so that the transgression would increase; but
where sin increased, grace abounded all the more,” (Romans 5:20, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who
is against us?” (Romans 8:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“You are from God, little children, and have overcome them;
because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world.” (1 John 4:4,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Trust in the LORD with all your heart And do not lean on your
own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He will make your
paths straight.” (Proverbs 3:5-6, NASB)</p>
