<h2>Communion, Mental Attitudes</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The central doctrine of communion is fellowship. In 1 Corinthians
10:16-17, the person and work of Christ are in focus. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Is not the cup of blessing which we bless a sharing in
the blood of Christ? Is not the bread which we break a sharing in the body of
Christ? Since there is one bread, we who are many are one body; for we all
partake of the one bread.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 10:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Also, to partake of the communion table while out of
fellowship is a serious sin and will result in divine discipline. You must
understand basic doctrines such as relationship and fellowship in communion. 1
Cor. 11:27. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the
Lord in an unworthy manner, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the
Lord.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 11:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Presented below are two of many possible approaches to
introducing the importance of the Communion ritual. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Doctrinal Approach</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Communion begins with pre-Cross activities. Facts are
presented about Jesus Christ and communion such as the Lord Jesus Christ is
God. His essence is presented. The facts of His Hypostatic Union of perfect
undiminished deity with perfect humanity in one person forever. The facts of His
perfect sinless humanity from His virgin birth to maintaining His sinless life
up to and through the Cross. 1 Cor. 11:23-26.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered
to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which He was betrayed took bread;
and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, &quot;This is My body,
which is for you; do this in remembrance of Me.&quot; In the same way He took
the cup also after supper, saying, &quot;This cup is the new covenant in My
blood; do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.&quot; For as
often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death
until He comes.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 11:23-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 11:23, “in the night” refers to the same
night as the last Passover and the first Lord’s Supper. “He was betrayed” is
the imperfect passive indicative of <span lang=EL>παραδι</span>́<span lang=EL>δωμι</span>
(paradidōmi) and means to give up, to give over, to act as a traitor. “Took
bread” refers to the humanity of Jesus Christ. He is the Bread of Life. The
human race eats the bread, signifying faith in Jesus Christ for salvation. John
6:31-33.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it
is written, 'HE GAVE THEM BREAD OUT OF HEAVEN TO EAT.'&quot; Jesus then said to
them, &quot;Truly, truly, I say to you, it is not Moses who has given you the
bread out of heaven, but it is My Father who gives you the true bread out of
heaven. &quot;For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven, and
gives life to the world.&quot;&quot;  (John 6:31-33, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 11:25, “He took the cup” refers to the substitutionary
spiritual death of Christ for the sins of all mankind. This is the doctrine of
the Baptism of the Cup. He drank the cup filled to the brim with the sins of
the world. He bore our sins in His own body on the tree. His blood indicates
this. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The human race drinks signifying faith in His work. “In
remembrance of Me” means to remember again, to keep the Lord Jesus Christ in your
thinking. This is the fragrance of memories that we are to have for a loved
one. In this case, the loved One, Jesus Christ. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The frame of reference and memory center in the right
lobe of the soul enables you to think divine viewpoint about Jesus Christ. This
is what you should think during communion. Therefore, we read Scripture during
communion like Isiah 53 to enable you to think about His person and work.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 11:26, “You proclaim the Lord’s death” is
your identification with the Body of Christ. “Proclaim” is <span lang=EL>καταγγε</span>́<span
lang=EL>λλω</span> (kataggellō) and is a strong word for proclaim. It is an
exhibit of your faith to partake of communion. “Until He comes” refers to the
Rapture of the Church where Church Age believers will meet Him in the air which
will end the Church Age and cause the resumption of the final seven years of
the Age of Israel (the Tribulation). It also refers to the Second Advent of
Jesus Christ that will occur at the end of the Tribulation when our Lord
physically returns to the earth. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Application Approach</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The application approach focuses on how all this relates
to you as a Church Age believer in Jesus Christ. In 1 Corinthians 11:27, “whoever
eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner” is a
warning from our Lord about abuses of the communion ritual. “Unworthy manner” is
<span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span lang=EL>ναξι</span>́<span lang=EL>ως</span>
(anaxiōs) and means to be careless about staying in fellowship. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the
Lord in an unworthy manner, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the
Lord.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 11:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Communion must be prepared for. In 1 Corinthians 11:28, “examine
himself” is <span lang=EL>δοκιμα</span>́<span lang=EL>ζω</span> (dokimazō) and
means to examine oneself in view of being approved to partake of communion. In
other words, are you in fellowship? </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But a man must examine himself, and in so doing he is to
eat of the bread and drink of the cup.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 11:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Communion can bring added divine discipline. In 1
Corinthians 11:29, “judgment” is <span lang=EL>κρι</span>́<span lang=EL>μα</span>
(krima) and means condemnation with discipline, one who is convicted in a court
of law.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For he who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgment to
himself if he does not judge the body rightly.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 11:29,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 11:30, “Weak” <span lang=EL>α</span>̓<span
lang=EL>σθενη</span>́<span lang=EL>ς</span> (asthenēs) and means diseased,
impotent, sick spiritually and physically. “Sick” is <span lang=EL>α</span>̓́<span
lang=EL>ρ</span>̓<span lang=EL>ρ</span>̔<span lang=EL>ωστος</span> (arrhōstos)
and means physically feeble, poor health, like in Psalms 38. “Sleep” is <span
lang=EL>κοιμα</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (koimaō) and is used of Christians
dying under the sin unto death from long-term reversionism.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For this reason many among you are weak and sick, and a
number sleep.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 11:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Communion is for people who understand confession of sin.
1 Cor. 11:31-32.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But if we judged ourselves rightly, we would not be judged.
But when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord so that we will not be
condemned along with the world.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 11:31-32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Use confession of sin before you get divine discipline <span
lang=EL>παιδευ</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span> (paideuō) leading to more discipline.
Luke 23:16; Luke 23:22. </p>

<p class=Verses>““Therefore I will punish Him and release Him.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Luke
23:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And he said to them the third time, “Why, what evil has this
man done? I have found in Him no guilt demanding death; therefore I will punish
Him and release Him.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Luke 23:22, NASB)</p>
