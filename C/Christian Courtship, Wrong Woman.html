<h2><a name="_D-Christian_Courtship,_The"></a><a
name="_Christian_Courtship,_The"></a>Christian Courtship, The Wrong Woman</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 5:1-2, David is teaching his son Solomon. In
Proverbs 5:1, “give attention” is the hiphil imperative causative active voice
of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>קשׁב</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (qâshab) and means to draw near with your
ear, to concentrate on my wisdom. “Wisdom” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>חכמה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(chokmâh) and means Bible doctrine in the right lobe of
the soul. “Incline your ear” is the hiphil imperative of <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>נטה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span>
(nâṭâh) and means to accept my authority as a teacher. “Understanding” is
information of a practical nature or application of Bible doctrine. </p>

<p class=Verses>“My son, give attention to my wisdom, Incline your ear to my
understanding; That you may observe discretion And your lips may reserve
knowledge.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 5:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“That you may observe” is the qal infinitive construct of
<span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שׁמר</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (shâmar) and means to be on post as a
guard, to be alert. “Discretion” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>מזמּה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span>
(mezimmâh) and means divisiveness, the cunning of a reversionistic woman.
Literally, to guard against divisiveness. “Reserve” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>נצר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span>
(nâtsar) and means to guard physically his body and to guard his soul. David
had made mistakes and had not guarded his own soul and lips for the right kind
of woman.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The literal translation of Proverbs 5:1-2; “My son,
concentrate on my doctrine. Extend your ear (accept my authority) to my
understanding. You extend your ear to guard against feminine divisiveness as
for knowledge that your lips (body) may guard it.” This also applies to male
divisiveness where mothers are to train their daughters about men on the prowl.
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Beginning and End of the Wrong Woman </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 5:3, “adulteress” is the qal active
participle of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>זוּר</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(zur) and means a
stranger, loathsome, to be reversionistic. His soul has to be protected from
her! “Drip” is the qal imperfect of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>נטף</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>(nâṭaph) and refers to what she says. It keeps on dripping. “Smoother”
is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>חלק</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(châlâq) and means
smooth, flattering. “Her speech” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>חך</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>(chêk) and refers to the inside of the mouth. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The literal translation of Proverbs 5:3; “For the inside
of her mouth is smoother than oil.” She is nice, but deceitful. She has used
some words and they have done a little French kissing. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For the lips of an adulteress drip honey And smoother
than oil is her speech;&quot;  (Proverbs 5:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 5:4, “in the end” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>אחרית</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>('achărı̂yth) and refers to the end of
the affair. While it started out as smooth as oil, what is the end? “She is
bitter” is the qal perfect of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>מרה</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (mârâh) and means great bitterness,
greatly distressed. Why? She is not the right kind of woman for him and he is
not the right one for her. That’s why!  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But in the end she is bitter as wormwood, Sharp as a
two-edged sword.&quot;  (Proverbs 5:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“As wormwood” is an idiom, a prepositional phrase and the
object of the preposition is the feminine singular of <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>לענה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(la‛ănâh) and refers to wormwood which is a poisonous
plant in Palestine that gave a terrible hangover. It was great at the
beginning, but the end was horrible. We are talking about an affair! Wormwood
is always used in a bad sense. Deut. 29:18; Jer. 9:15; Jer. 23:15. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;so that there will not be among you a man or woman, or
family or tribe, whose heart turns away today from the LORD our God, to go and
serve the gods of those nations; that there will not be among you a root
bearing poisonous fruit and wormwood.&quot;  (Deuteronomy 29:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts concerning
the prophets, 'Behold, I am going to feed them wormwood And make them drink
poisonous water, For from the prophets of Jerusalem Pollution has gone forth
into all the land.'&quot;&quot;  (Jeremiah 23:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This woman was inconsequential to this man. He should
have waited! When the wrong man or wrong woman gets their hooks into you, it is
like being stabbed by a very short sword, like being poisoned. “Sharp” is the
feminine adjective <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>חד</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(chad) and means she
stabs you. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The literal translation of Proverbs 5:4; “But the end of
the affair becomes bitter like wormwood (you can get high on it at the time,
but the repercussions are terrible) sharp as a two-edged sword.” She has
wrecked the man, now what about her?</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Judgment on the Woman </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 5:5, “Her feet go down to death” refers to
how women dressed at that time. A woman had a head on one end, feet on the
other and a long robe in between. In those days, men were head men (lips) or
feet men. The feet were very seductive to a man and to see the ankles was
immoral.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Her feet go down to death, Her steps take hold of Sheol.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs
5:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Go down to death” is the qal active participle of <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>ירד</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(yârad) and refers to the sin unto death,
to stretch like a corpse. Both the man and the woman here were believers. Some
of you think promiscuity is a sign of an unbeliever. No! She goes down a step
at a time every time she gets into bed with some guy.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Her steps” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>צעד</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>(tsa‛ad) and means sexy, mincing steps. Her sexy walk embraces the
grave. “Take” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>תּמך</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(tâmak) and means
that every time she embraces the wrong guy, gets into bed with him and has sex,
she is taking another step toward getting into bed with the grave. She makes
conquest after conquest, but her ultimate conquest is the grave! She is going to
wind up in a wooden box! No woman can afford promiscuity! </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The literal translation of Proverbs 5:5; “Her seductive
feet are going down to the grave, her sexy steps embrace the grave.” The grave
will put you flat on your back and keep you there!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>A Redirect to Solomon </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 5:6, “ponder” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>פּלס</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(pâlas) and means to weigh, to consider, to ponder.
David wishes to remove or avoid for his young son Solomon the danger of
promiscuity. Therefore, he warns his son as to her lack of consideration for
the life she is leading. “The path of life” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL>ארח</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'><span dir=LTR></span>
<span dir=RTL>חַיִּים</span></span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span>
('ôrach chayyim) and means the manner or mode of life.</p>

<p class=Verses>“She does not ponder the path of life; Her ways are unstable,
she does not know it.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 5:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Literal translation of Proverbs 5:6; “Perhaps my son you
should consider (while you still have a chance) her lack of consideration of
the consequences of the manner of life that she leads. Before you get taken in
by such women, know that she doesn’t have concern for the life she lives and
how it impacts others. She is unstable, unfaithful, and she has many lovers,
you are just one. You do not know her. You are nothing to her!”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Probably the two proudest people in the world are the man
who does not believe in eternal security and the man who thinks all woman are
crazy about him. “Her ways” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>עגּלה</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(ma‛gâlâh) and
refers to her manner of life. “Unstable” is the qal perfect of <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>נוּע</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(nûa‛) and means to reel to and fro, to
go back and forth, to wander about. She intensely says I love you and does the
same thing the next night with someone else! </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Although the subjects here are not often talked about in
the local church, but in the bedroom and at bars, this is the Word of God! </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Continued Counsel by David to His Son, Solomon </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 5:7, “Now then” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>עתּה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(‛attâh) and means at this time, henceforth, now,
straightway, this time, whereas. “Listen to me” is the qal imperative of <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שׁמע</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(shâma‛) and means to concentrate. This
is a strong plea from David for concentration on what he is saying.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Now then, my sons, listen to me And do not depart from the
words of my mouth.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 5:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 5:8, “Keep” is the hiphil infinitive absolute
of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>רחק</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(râchaq) and is a
causative purpose. It means that Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the soul
causes a person to stay away from her. “Your way” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>דּרך</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(derek) and means your way of life. “Do not go” is the
qal imperfect of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>קרב</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(qârab) and means do
not approach the door of her house. Why? The answer is in Proverbs 5:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Keep your way far from her And do not go near the door of her
house,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 5:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The literal translation of Proverbs 5:8; “Get your way of
life as far away from her as possible and do not come near the door of her
house.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 5:9, “Or” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>פּן</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(pên) and is used by David who is anxious for his son
Solomon to avoid any mistakes which he had made. “You will give” is the qal
imperfect of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>נתן</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(nâthan) and means to
give, to apply, to appoint, to ascribe, to assign. “Your vigor” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>הוד</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(hôd) and means honor, glory of the man
by divine design. This is something that God has and He gives or shares on a
grace basis. Your glory is your right kind of woman and your capacity to
satisfy your right kind of woman. Only you can do it. She has an insatiable
desire for you and only you can satisfy her soul and body.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Or you will give your vigor to others And your years to the
cruel one;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 5:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Others” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>אחר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>('achêr) and is like the Greek word ἕτερος (heteros) and means
another of a different kind, the wrong woman, pseudo love or sex with the wrong
person. Sex within the confines of marriage is never wrong. Your glory or
vigor, all of it, (sex) belongs to one woman – your wife! If you had spiritual
discernment prior to marriage, you married the right kind of woman for you. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“The cruel one” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>אכזרי</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>('akzârı̂y) and refers to a
reversionistic woman who is cruel and vindictive. She stomps on your vigor. She
knifes you with your own honor which you were stupid enough to give! The
literal translation of Proverbs 5:9; “Or you will give your vigor (your sex and
honor) to the wrong woman for you and your years of sexual vigor to the cruel
vindictive one who is full of bitterness.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 5:10, “And strangers will be filled with your
strength” refers to the alternative to learning Bible doctrine. “Strangers” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>זוּר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(zur) and is a noun in the feminine gender
and refers to the wrong woman, the promiscuous woman. “Be filled” is  the piel
imperfect of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שׂבע</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(śâba‛) and means
to fill to satisfaction (literally or figuratively), to have enough, to be
full, to have plenty of, to be satiated.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And strangers will be filled with your strength And your
hard-earned goods will go to the house of an alien;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 5:10,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Your strength” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>כֹּחַ</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(koach) and refers to sexual performance. “Hard-earned
goods” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>עֶצֶב</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(etseb) and means
painful toil whether of body or mind. “Alien” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>נכרי</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(nokrı̂y) and means a stranger, an adulterous woman, an
alien. The literal translation of Proverbs 5:10; “And the promiscuous women
become satiated with your vigor (sex performance) and your hard-earned wages go
to an adulterous woman.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 5:11, “groan” is the qal perfect from <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>נהם</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(nâham) and means to mourn in distress or
groan in distress. “Flesh” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>בּשׂר</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(bâśâr) and refers
to the entire male body. “Body” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>שׁאר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>(she'êr) and refers to the male phallus. “Consumed” is <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>כּלה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(kâlâh) and refers to male impotence. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And you groan at your final end, When your flesh and your body
are consumed;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 5:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What is the end of the male? Impotence. What is the end
of the female? She becomes a nymph or becomes frustrated, frigid. The literal
translation of Proverbs 5:11; “And you groan in distress at your end when your
body function and your phallus is ruined.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 5:12, “How” is interrogative adverb <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>איך</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>('êyk) and means that this is the end of
the line for the playboy. It is his death cry. “I have hated instruction” is
the qal perfect of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שׂנא</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(śânê') and means
to hate, to detest.  He rejected warning and authority. “Instruction” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>מוּסר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(mûsâr) and refers to doctrinal warning.
The warnings from Bible doctrine are often disciplinary warnings. </p>

<p class=Verses>“And you say, “How I have hated instruction! And my heart
spurned reproof!”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 5:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Heart” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>לב</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(lêb) and refers to
the right lobe of the soul. “Spurned” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>נאץ</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(nâ'ats) and means to deride, to ridicule something
that is better than you. What is better than you? God’s principles regarding
the Divine Institution of Marriage as the only relationship where sexual
relations are to be found.  All other situations and relationships constitute
sin. He had negative volition toward Bible doctrine to the point of despising
it.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>People today ridicule principles and institutions they
have rejected. Some ridicule the military. The military is better than they.
Some ridicule the flag of our country. The flag is better than they. When
people do not know what to do in the midst of something magnificent or
wonderful, they ridicule it. There is usually a ring leader who ridicules, then
others follow suit. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Better than all of us is the gift of God's grace and the
Divine Institutions of Volition, Marriage, Family, and Nationalism.  The
literal translation of Proverbs 5:12 is; “And you say, I have hated Bible
doctrine and the right lobe of my soul despises and ridicules corrective
admonition.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 5:13, “have not listened” is <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שׁמע</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(shâma‛) and means to hear intelligently
often with implication of attention, obedience, discernment, perception,
concentration. This guy always comes to the place where he says, “I should have
listened.” “The voice of my teacher” is Bible doctrine. </p>

<p class=Verses>““I have not listened to the voice of my teachers, Nor inclined
my ear to my instructors!”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 5:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Nor inclined” is the hiphil perfect of <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>נטה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(nâṭâh) and “my ear” refers to strong
concentration. He did not use his ear in learning Bible doctrine and therefore
did not do well in the area of sex. The literal translation of Proverbs 5:13;
“And have not concentrated on the Bible doctrine from my teacher nor
concentrated on them who taught me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 5:14, “I was almost in utter ruin” means that
when people go negative to the teaching of Bible doctrine, divine discipline
begins and as God's discipline intensifies, they leave the divine principles
taught and they get into all manner of evil. </p>

<p class=Verses>““I was almost in utter ruin In the midst of the assembly and
congregation.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 5:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This verse describes where Solomon went negative. He
first went negative to God's teachings or Bible doctrine and then he did the
opposite of what was taught regarding the proper boundaries for sexual
relations within the Divine Institution of Marriage. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>An Analogy in Connection with Grace Gifts </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 5:15, “Drink” is the qal imperative of <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שׁתה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(shâthâh) and means to drink and enjoy
it, to banquet, to feast, to have your thirst quenched. Three times in
Scripture we see water as an analogy of grace. Here in Proverbs 5:15, it refers
to the right kind of woman for the man. In Isaiah 55:1, it refers to salvation.
In Ephesians 5:26, it refers to Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Drink water from your own cistern And fresh water from your
own well.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 5:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;Ho! Every one who thirsts, come to the waters; And you
who have no money come, buy and eat. Come, buy wine and milk Without money and
without cost.” (Isaiah 55:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“so that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the
washing of water with the word,” (Ephesians 5:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is used of a man who is sexually thirsty for his
right woman and his thirst is quenched by his relationship with her. This is
one of the great forms of happiness in life. All of the forms of happiness in
life are related to the gifts of life. “Water” is in the plural, but involves
only one woman. There are many relationships with her. This indicates the many
times that the right man drinks at the well of his right woman. 2 Kings 18:31
gives the same concept. Many acts of drinking, but one well! </p>

<p class=Verses>“'Do not listen to Hezekiah, for thus says the king of Assyria,
&quot;Make your peace with me and come out to me, and eat each of his vine and
each of his fig tree and drink each of the waters of his own cistern,” (2 Kings
18:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Cistern” refers to a covered well. This means that the
wife should be covered to everyone else. Who pulls the cover off the well? Only
her husband. Therefore, the wife should be discreet in her dress to the outside
world. She is designed to be appreciated sexually only by her husband!  You can
always tell a woman who isn’t the right kind of woman because she advertises
herself! She shows off her wealth. She is undressed in her dress. The doctrinal
wife does not try to attract the other males of the human race. A flirty woman,
a woman who is wearing her dress a little too short or with a neckline too low
is obviously not a cistern! She shows her dissatisfaction and frustration.
Obvious to all, you can read the signs of the time. Stay away from her!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To the outside world, the well or cistern is covered. But
here, to her husband, the well is uncovered. In Proverbs 5:15, “fresh water”
qal active participle linear Aktionsart of <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>נזל</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(nâzal) and means flowing water. This describes the
wife’s soul and sexual relationship with her husband.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Divine design programs the right kind of woman for a
right kind of man. Therefore, sexual relations outside of marriage is either
fornication or adultery and are prohibited by the Word of God. In Song of
Solomon 4:12 a virgin is described in terms of a locked garden and a spring
sealed up. She is holding her fountain for the right man.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;A garden locked is my sister, my bride, A rock garden
locked, a spring sealed up.” (Song of Solomon 4:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Today, sexual immorality is common. These are the days
when sex manuals condone experimentation. You shop for bodies like you shop for
clothes. The greatest pleasure between the spiritually discerning man and the
spiritually discerning woman comes when both of them are married because they
both have waited! Then the programming has in no way been destroyed, there are
no short circuits, no hang ups, there are no problems. It is a very beautiful
thing.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Whereas a woman is a well or a river in the right sense,
a wrong woman is a deep ditch and a narrow pit. It is impossible to get water
out of a deep ditch or a narrow pit. A person who goes to this type of place to
get water, never satisfies his thirst. Prov. 23:27.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For a harlot is a deep pit And an adulterous woman is a narrow
well.” (Proverbs 23:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is not safe to drink from a deep ditch. They used to
use deep ditches or pits as outdoor toilets. When you are whoring around, it is
like going to a bar for a drink, but never quenching your thirst and receiving
other troubles as well. Prov. 23:28-29.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Surely she lurks as a robber, And increases the faithless
among men. Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has contentions? Who has
complaining? Who has wounds without cause? Who has redness of eyes?” (Proverbs
23:28-29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 5:15, “Fresh water from your own well” is the
woman designed for you. A sexual legalist says any nice girl will do and tries
to redesign her, to remake her. You may try to program some woman into the
right kind of woman for you. If you are spiritually discerning from the Bible
doctrine in your soul, you will wait on the Lord for the right kind of woman to
come along. This also applies to the ladies in their wait for their right kind
of man. Spiritual growth is the key by which you will be able to discern the
right characteristics of the man you are attracted to.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The literal translation of Proverbs 5:15; “Drink waters
of pleasure from your own cistern (wife, covered storage) and flowing waters
(sex response) from your very own well, your wife.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>An Analogy of Water Streams </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 5:16, “springs” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>מעין</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(ma‛yân) and means gushing waters and refers to the
male sex drive, the sexual ability of the male. In the previous verse, the
water was just there. Here it is very active. The force of water stirs her up
and satisfies her. A woman can be like a pond, but with her husband, she can be
wild, stormy, and passionate. The principle is that no wife is placid when her
husband is making love to her.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Should your springs be dispersed abroad, Streams of water in
the streets?” (Proverbs 5:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Be dispersed” is the qal perfect of <span lang=HE
dir=RTL>פּוּץ</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(puts)
and means to be disbursed or scattered. Your springs (many sex acts) shall not
be disbursed and is a prohibition of any of the sexual perversions. “Streams”
is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>פּלג</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(peleg) and means a
small channel of water. “Waters” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>מים</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>(mayim) and refers to many sex acts. “In the streets” refers to the
social confusion that results. When a man lets his sexual aggressiveness be
disbursed to other women, he is ruining his own sexual intimacy before he
finally finds the right woman for him. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The more adultery that fills a nation, the more a nation
is divided. There is no stability! The higher the amount of adultery, the more
confusion in a national entity. Men and women have been designed by God's grace
for someone else within the boundaries of marriage. When a man has sex prior to
marriage, he is ruining his own sexual intimacy before he has found the right
woman for him. The same is true for the woman who has sex prior to marriage.
Recognition of the right kind of woman for him and the right kind of man for
her requires spiritual discernment from Bible doctrine in the soul.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Men will find that having sex prior to marriage will
never quench the woman’s desire for sex! Not even if you are clever or capable.
Her body is related to her soul. You can only frustrate and ruin her sexual
intimacy with her future husband and you can only frustrate and ruin your
sexual intimacy with your future wife. You are tampering with God’s design
which ruins her happiness and your happiness. The literal translation of
Proverbs 5:16; “Your fountains (your sex acts) shall not be scattered or overflow
to other women, resulting is social confusion.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 5:17, “Let them” is the qal perfect of <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>היה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(hâyâh) and refers to your sex acts and
that they should be for your wife only. “Strangers” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>זוּר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(zur) and refers to any woman other than your wife. The
literal translation of Proverbs 5:17; “Let your sex acts be for your one and
only wife, not for any reversionistic, promiscuous woman.”</p>

<p class=Verses>“Let them be yours alone And not for strangers with you.”
(Proverbs 5:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Primacy of the Man’s Wife in Marriage </b></p>

<p class=Verses>“As a loving hind and a graceful doe, Let her breasts satisfy

dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שׁגה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span

you both agree in the area of sexual relationship in marriage is permissible.
If she agrees, she responds to it. There is no such thing as perversion between
husband and wife in marriage. If both agree, anything goes!</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The literal translation of Proverbs 5:19; “An amorous,
sexy doe, a wild female goat, her sex response is the benefit of grace, her
breasts shall intoxicate you at all times. You shall constantly wander up and
down her body in the area of her love.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Fate of the Sexual Reversionist</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>David had been on both sides of the fence with regard to
sexual promiscuity. He had been the predator and he had experienced the soul
and sexual love of husband and wife in marriage. David knew that even if you
have blown it, you haven’t completely blown it if you are consistently learning
Bible doctrine under your right pastor-teacher. David blew it on a limited
basis. Solomon blew it all the way. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Some of you have backgrounds where you heard four letter
words and they were common fare. Sex was discussed like a job. Nothing to it.
It’s routine sex. But many of you have fundamental backgrounds or were taught
that sex before marriage was a no-no. To you, the four letter sexual words are
absolutely unacceptable at any time.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 5:20, “For why should you, my son,” is a
simple interrogative and indicates that David knew that his son Solomon had a
wandering roving spirit. “Be exhilarated with an adulteress” is a question
posed to Solomon and refers to a promiscuous, reversionistic woman. “And
embrace” is the piel imperfect of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>חבק</span><span dir=LTR></span><span dir=LTR></span> (châbaq)
and means to cohabit, to have sex, to have conjugal love. The qal stem means to
embrace, but this is the piel stem. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For why should you, my son, be exhilarated with an adulteress
And embrace the bosom of a foreigner?” (Proverbs 5:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“And embrace the bosom of a foreigner” is <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>חיק</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(chêyq) and means a cavity or a hole. It
is the inside of or the hollow part of the chariot. It is the hollow in the
hearth where the fire is kept for burning. Now what do you suppose <i>chêyq</i>
is referring to? The female genitals. The literal translation of Proverbs 5:20;
“And why my son should you wander up and down the body of a promiscuous woman
and embrace the genitals of a nymph?” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 5:21, “For the ways of a man” refers to the
pattern or function of life. This refers to sex. Solomon turned out to be a
wolf, the one who likes to make a lot of conquests! He tried to rebuild women
with his phallus. He tried to redesign women to his liking. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He didn’t accept the doctrine of abstinence before
marriage. He didn’t accept the doctrine of the Divine Institution of Marriage
where sex is only between the husband and wife. He believed that he could use
his sexual equipment to rebuild the women he selected and intended to change
them to suit his tastes and desires! </p>

<p class=Verses>“For the ways of a man are before the eyes of the LORD, And He
watches all his paths.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He felt he could take any woman and reconstruct her and
program her to fit what he wanted. There are many men like this in the world.
You may hear the braggarts in the bars, in the showers, and in the late hours
when the alcohol is flowing freely. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“For the promiscuous ways of a man are before the Lord”
means that nothing is done under cover that God does not know about. “He
watches” is the piel participle of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>פָּלַס</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>(pâlas) and means to watch, to weigh in a balanced scale. The literal

ways of man are weighed in a balanced scale for all paths that he takes.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 5:22, “His own iniquities” is <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>עון</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(‛âvôn) and means sin in the sense of

possible in four areas: bestiality, homosexuality, lesbianism, and fornication.</p>

<p class=Verses>“His own iniquities will capture the wicked, And he will be

dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(chebel) and means
fetters, rope, chains. “Of his sins” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>חַטָּאת</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>(chattath) and means habitual sinfulness and its penalty or punishment.
This has the connotation of idolatry. He idolized her. Sex is his idol. He is a
slave to her. She has her last great affair with a pine box! His last great
affair has chained him to an idol.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The literal translation of Proverbs 5:22; “His own
perversions will trap him with a reversionistic female, and he shall be seized
and bound with chains to his own feminine idol with associated punishment.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The principle here is that every act of sex apart from
your wife in marriage is a chain binding the man to an idol. Man cannot create
God, so man designs an idol as a substitute of his own liking in this case sex
and calls it “God.” Solomon never found the right woman for him because he
lacked the spiritual discernment to ever do so. His evil habits caused him to
not be able to recognize her when she came along. He received the shadow, the
idol, rather than the substance, the real thing. You can make love to an idol,
have dreams about an idol, but an idol will never satisfy.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The woman negative to Bible doctrine does not wait for
the right man for her with Bible doctrine in his soul. Instead, she ignores
what the Word of God says about sex before marriage and has affairs with men
and ends up marrying a man that was not the right kind of man for her. Before
marrying, neither she nor the man had any spiritual discernment with which to
determine the right kind of spouse that God had provided in grace. Instead,
they entered into marriage based on physical attraction and compatibility of
sin natures. There was no ability or interest in exploring what was in their
souls. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When men or women are promiscuous before marriage, they
bring to any marriage the baggage of previous sexual escapades. They then can’t
help but think of those escapades when they are in bed with their spouse. They
think about the similarities and contrasts when in bed. Their sex will be much
less that it could have been. The soul rapport is missing! </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The only way out for such a situation is to get Bible
doctrine in their souls and by growing spiritually, let the divine viewpoint
push the past behaviors and associated thinking from their thought patterns and
to appreciate the one they have married. In this way, the grace of God can
transform the soul of husband and wife, thus making their marriage based on
soul rapport. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 5:23, “He will die for lack of instruction”
is very unusual construction because we have a pronoun in the emphatic
construction. “He” and only he refers to the promiscuous male. “Will die” is
the qal imperfect of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>מוּת</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(mûth) and “for lack

from Jesus Christ - the woman and Bible doctrine. Triple compound happiness is
to have the three gifts!</p>

<p class=Verses>“He will die for lack of instruction, And in the greatness of

dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שׁגה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(shâgâh) and means he will never find
his place in life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>As an illustration, God said that it was not good that
man should be alone. So Jesus Christ provided a woman for the first Adam. The
thing that took care of loneliness was grace. The principle here is that grace
takes care of the lonely. Grace takes up the slack.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ was alone on the Cross. It was not good that
Jesus Christ was alone, but He had to be alone because He was the only One who
could bear the penalty of our sins. When Jesus Christ was resurrected from the
dead, He was still alone. Today, He is waiting for His bride (Church Age
believers) to be formed. We wait for face-to-face contact with the bridegroom.
So the Last Adam is still alone at the right hand of the Father, so the Father
gave the Son a bride, the Church.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Church is called a body today because it is being
built, <i>banah</i>. The rib is comparable to Positional Truth. The rib was
violently pulled out of the first Adam and when we believe we are put into
union with Jesus Christ by God the Holy Spirit. So, when we die physically, we
see Him face-to-face. At the Judgment Seat of Christ, all human good will be
removed thus completing the preparation of a perfect bride for Jesus Christ. It
is not good for the first Adam or the Last Adam to be alone, so for both a
grace gift is provided. We are the Father’s grace gift to His Son. He will
never be alone again. </p>
