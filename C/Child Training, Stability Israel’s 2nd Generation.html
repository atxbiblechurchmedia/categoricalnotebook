<h2>Child Training, Stability of Israel’s Second Generation</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When Moses was an old man of 120, he was having
protracted meetings and giving the second generation of Israel the Bible
doctrine that they would need before they entered the Land. What the older
generation lost, the younger generation gained. It is important for parents to
teach their children Bible doctrine as they are the future of the nation. The
whole goal of raising children is to impart a love for Bible doctrine and
spiritual maturing.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Four Generation Curse is a dead-end brought about by
successive generations of believers negative to Bible doctrine. Deut. 5:9;
Prov. 30:11. See category on the <a href="#_D-Four_Generation_Curse">Four
Generation Curse</a>.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;'You shall not worship them or serve them; for I, the
LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the
children, and on the third and the fourth generations of those who hate
Me,&quot;  (Deuteronomy 5:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;There is a kind of man who curses his father And does not
bless his mother.&quot;  (Proverbs 30:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The family curse is broken by salvation through faith in
Jesus Christ and the accumulation of <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the
soul resulting in an edification complex of the soul. The “lovingkindness to
thousands” in Deuteronomy 5:10 is an idiom for perpetual blessing in all
generations who are positive to Jesus Christ and Bible doctrine. Deut. 5:29; Deut.
5:32-33.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;but showing lovingkindness to thousands, to those who
love Me and keep My commandments.&quot;  (Deuteronomy 5:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;'Oh that they had such a heart in them, that they would
fear Me and keep all My commandments always, that it may be well with them and
with their sons forever!&quot;  (Deuteronomy 5:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;So you shall observe to do just as the LORD your
God has commanded you; you shall not turn aside to the right or to the left.
&quot;You shall walk in all the way which the LORD your God has commanded you,
that you may live and that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong
your days in the land which you will possess.&quot;  (Deuteronomy 5:32-33,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Deuteronomy 5 is an introduction. This is what you must
become, but Deuteronomy 6 gives the mechanics, very clearly. This is done
through the teaching of Bible doctrine. In Deuteronomy 6:1, the command is to
teach and do. You teach by commands to small children. You are firm, loving,
but you see that the command is carried out.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Now this is the commandment, the statutes and the
judgments which the LORD your God has commanded me to teach you, that you might
do them in the land where you are going over to possess it,&quot;  (Deuteronomy
6:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Commandment” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>מצוה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>(mitsvâh) and means a law, an ordinance, a precept, a command like the
ten commandments. “Statutes” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>חק</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(chôq) and means a
decree, an enactment, an engraving. “Judgments” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>משׁפּט</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(mishpâṭ) and means penalty for the
crime. This is the enforcement of the commandments and statutes. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To “teach” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>למד</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>(lâmad) and means to goad, the rod being an orienting incentive. This
is the authority the master had over the ox, etc. To “do” is <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>עָשָׂה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(asah) and means to do, to accomplish.
This word is extensively used in the Old Testament meaning to manufacture
something out of something. When you take in Bible doctrine, you wish to take
in more doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is a four-fold staging for teaching children Bible
doctrine. In Deuteronomy 6:2-3, teaching your children Bible doctrine is
commanded.  To “fear the Lord” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>יָרֵא</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>(yare) and means to revere, to respect, to stand in awe of. What is
this? It is a built-in soul response to authority. Your authority is to be
established gently and in kindness. Your authority is to be established firmly
in love. Your authority is to be established finally in strength of character. Your
frame of reference is security for your children.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;so that you and your son and your grandson might fear the
LORD your God, to keep all His statutes and His commandments which I command
you, all the days of your life, and that your days may be prolonged. &quot;O
Israel, you should listen and be careful to do it, that it may be well with you
and that you may multiply greatly, just as the LORD, the God of your fathers,
has promised you, in a land flowing with milk and honey.&quot;  (Deuteronomy
6:2-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Deuteronomy 6:3, to “listen” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שׁמע</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(shâma‛) and means to hear with full attention, to
concentrate, to listen under obedience, to listen under authority. This
involves being attentive, getting their attention, being clear, objective and
authoritative. It involves concentration, thinking, and mastering what is said
and making it your own.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>To “be careful to do it” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שׁמר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(shâmar) and means to hedge about, to guard, to
protect, attend to, to observe to do it. This is the follow-through. If you’ve
got a problem in the home, solve it. Don’t let the situation drag on. This is
what kills you. To “multiply greatly” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>רָבָה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(rabah) and means to prosper very greatly
and is an idiom for fantastic prosperity. Psalms 36:1; Rom. 3:18. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For the choir director. A Psalm of David the servant of
the LORD. Transgression speaks to the ungodly within his heart; There is no
fear of God before his eyes.&quot;  (Psalms 36:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;THERE IS NO FEAR OF GOD BEFORE THEIR
EYES.&quot;&quot;  (Romans 3:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is taught from generation to generation. This is
taught from the father to the son, from the grandfather to the grandson, the
three visible generations. Deuteronomy 6:34 is a idiom for taking care of the
situation one day at a time!</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;So do not worry about tomorrow; for tomorrow will
care for itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.&quot;  (Matthew 6:34,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Teaching 0-12 Year Old Children</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The central doctrine in teaching children from 0-12 years
is the essence of God. This applies to parents teaching the essence of God and
Sunday school teachers teaching the essence of God. Emphasize who God is.
Emphasize that God is always fair. Deut. 6:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Hear, O Israel! The LORD is our God, the LORD is
one!&quot;  (Deuteronomy 6:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The main goal in teaching the child from 0-12 is to lay
foundations for their firm maturity. In Deuteronomy 6:5, “You shall love” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>אהב</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>('âhab) and means a total soul love for
the Lord, the love of the mature believer, a combination of <i>agapao</i> and <i>phileo</i>
love. “The Lord your God” refers to the Lord Jesus Christ our Elohim one Lord
(in essence). “With all your heart” is an idiom for a mature believer with a
completed edification complex of the soul. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;You shall love the LORD your God with all your
heart and with all your soul and with all your might.&quot;  (Deuteronomy 6:5,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“With all your soul” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL>נפשׁ</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(nephesh) and is an
idiom that means with all your breath, with all life, all vitality. It is a
term for the stability in the spiritual life. “With all your might:” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>מאד</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(me'ôd) and means diligently and is an
idiom for production and a term for divine good production.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Deuteronomy 7:7 and Psalms 91:14, the Hebrew word for
“love” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>חָשַׁק</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(chashaq) and means
to cling as two lovers, to  embrace in marriage. This is equivalent to the
Greek verb <span lang=EL>α</span>̔́<span lang=EL>πτω</span> (haptō) which
means to fasten to, to cling, to kindle a fire, to arouse. 1 Cor. 7:1; John
20:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;The LORD did not set His love on you nor choose you
because you were more in number than any of the peoples, for you were the
fewest of all peoples,&quot;  (Deuteronomy 7:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Because he has loved Me, therefore I will deliver
him; I will set him securely on high, because he has known My name.&quot; 
(Psalms 91:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now concerning the things about which you wrote, it is
good for a man not to touch a woman.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 7:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Jesus said to her, &quot;Stop clinging to Me, for I have
not yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brethren and say to them, 'I
ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God.'&quot;&quot; 
(John 20:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 18:1, the Hebrew word for “love” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>רחם</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(râcham) and means to fondle, used as the
prelude word for sex, to neck, to pet, etc. An exclusive term for married love.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For the choir director. A Psalm of David the servant of
the LORD, who spoke to the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD
delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. And
he said, &quot;I love You, O LORD, my strength.&quot;&quot;  (Psalms 18:1,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Song of Solomon 2:10, “beloved” is <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>דּוד</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(dôd) and means to boil, to love, a love
token. Used of Solomon trying to persuade the Shulammite Woman to marry him. “My
darling” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>רעיה</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(ra‛yâh) and means a
female associate or companion and describes the Shulammite Woman by her
Shepherd Lover.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;My beloved responded and said to me, 'Arise, my
darling, my beautiful one, And come along.&quot;  (Song of Solomon 2:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The commandment of Deuteronomy 6:6-9 is given to fathers
for their children. If you are planning to have children and not planning to
teach them Bible doctrine, this is no good. In Deuteronomy 6:6, Moses
instructed the fathers to continually and diligently teach their children Bible
doctrine. He didn’t say, “will you please?” He said, “do it!” Moses taught by
the categorical imperative. He expected the fathers to do the same and for
their wives to also reflect that teaching. The father taught and the children
learned. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;These words, which I am commanding you today, shall be
on your heart.” (Deuteronomy 6:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Deuteronomy 6:7, “You shall teach them diligently” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שׁנן</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(shânan) and means to point, to pierce,
to inculcate, to prick, to sharpen, to whet. This is typical authoritative
teaching in the home, quite a rare word in the sense of teaching. It is a
definite classroom situation in the home. The same word in the Hebrew is used
for “teach” and “diligently.”</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You shall teach them diligently to your sons and shall
talk of them when you sit in your house and when you walk by the way and when
you lie down and when you rise up.” (Deuteronomy 6:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Shall talk of them” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>דּבר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(dâbar) and means to arrange, to communicate audibly by
arranging words in sentences. It is the equivalent of <span lang=EL>λαλε</span>́<span
lang=EL>ω</span> (laleō) in the Greek. “When you sit in your house” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>ישׁב</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(yâshab) and means more than sitting
down. It means to swell, to remain, to be settled. “House” is <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>בּית</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(bayith) and means house of the family.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“When you walk by the way” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>הלך</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(hâlak) and means to walk, carry, march, etc. “The way”
is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>דּרך</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(derek) refers to
going out to work with your sons, coming in at night, conversational,
proverbial teaching. “When you lie down” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שׁכב</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(shâkab) and is a general term for lying down for rest
or for sleep. Here, it is an idiom for teaching in the evening. “When you rise
up” is an idiom for teaching in the morning. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Deuteronomy 6:8, “You shall bind them” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>קשׁר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(qâshar) and means to tie, to knit, to
join together, to join doctrines together. “Sign on your hand” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>אות</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>('ôth) and means an appearance, a signal,
flag, beacon, monument, evidence, exhibit. These are the Divine Institution
doctrines which preserve the children until they can accept Jesus Christ as
Savior and which preserve the children after salvation until they can mature
spiritually. “Frontals on your forehead” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>טופפה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(ṭôphâphâh) and means to go around, or
bind a fillet for the forehead.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You shall bind them as a sign on your hand and they
shall be as frontals on your forehead.” (Deuteronomy 6:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Deuteronomy 6:9, “You shall write them” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>כּתב</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(kâthab) and means to grave, to write, to
record, to inscribe. A witness that they have been taught, a perfect example
being Joshua 24 in the large stone under the oak. “Doorposts of your house” are
the tent poles that held up the tent and is an idiom for your house being
supported by the Word of God. “And on your gates” is the entrance to a house or
city and is an idiom meaning as the man entered in and out of his house, he was
head, he sat in the gates. Joshua 24:24-27.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and
on your gates.” (Deuteronomy 6:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The people said to Joshua, &quot;We will serve the LORD our
God and we will obey His voice.&quot; So Joshua made a covenant with the people
that day, and made for them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem. And Joshua
wrote these words in the book of the law of God; and he took a large stone and
set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of the LORD. Joshua
said to all the people, &quot;Behold, this stone shall be for a witness against
us, for it has heard all the words of the LORD which He spoke to us; thus it
shall be for a witness against you, so that you do not deny your God.&quot;”
(Joshua 24:24-27, NASB)</p>
