<h2>The Night Before Christmas</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The true significance of Christmas is certainly not Santa
and his pack, it is Jesus Christ and His Cross. The following are certain
characteristics of the biblical night before Christmas for your thinking
pleasure. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It is not X-mas! X-mas is receiving gifts without having
received the only gift, Jesus Christ. X-mas is putting lights on a Christmas
tree without having within you the light of the world, the Lord Jesus Christ.
X-mas is commercial, but Christmas is biblical. It is then with the person of
Christ in view that we share this message with you.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At the time of the birth of our Lord, a census had been
ordered for the entire Roman Empire. This involved compulsory registration.
They had no choice short of a terrific penalty. It would result ultimately in
more taxation as they were feeling a money pinch at that time in history. Luke
2:1. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now in those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus,
that a census be taken of all the inhabited earth.&quot;  (Luke 2:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The chronology of the registration was discredited by
historians for years, but it has since been proven true by archeology in recent
years. Luke 2:2. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;This was the first census taken while Quirinius was
governor of Syria.&quot;  (Luke 2:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The character of the registration involved all Jews
having to go to the place of their lineage. Both Mary and Joseph went to the
same place as David who was their common ancestor. Joseph was the legal (not
biological) father of Christ descended from David and Bathsheba through
Solomon. Mary was the mother of the humanity of Christ and descended from David
and Bathsheba through Nathan. Luke 2:3-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And everyone was on his way to register for the census,
each to his own city. Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of
Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David which is called Bethlehem, because he
was of the house and family of David, in order to register along with Mary, who
was engaged to him, and was with child.&quot;  (Luke 2:3-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Life and Death </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A new unique life began. Jesus Christ was virgin born and
thus born without an old sin nature. He is undiminished deity and true humanity
in one person forever. Luke 2:6-7. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;While they were there, the days were completed for her to
give birth. And she gave birth to her firstborn son; and she wrapped Him in
cloths, and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the
inn.&quot;  (Luke 2:6-7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“First born son” the right of the first born. First born
was the sovereign of the family. First born was the priest. First born had the
double portion. In the case of Christ, there will be two advents and two deaths
on the Cross – spiritual followed by physical. Isaiah 53:9. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;His grave was assigned with wicked men, Yet He was with a
rich man in His death, Because He had done no violence, Nor was there any
deceit in His mouth.&quot;  (Isaiah 53:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Romans 1:4, “death” is the genitive masculine plural
of νεκρός (nekros) and is the plural of death - deaths. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;who was declared the Son of God with power by the
resurrection from the dead, according to the Spirit of holiness, Jesus Christ
our Lord,&quot;  (Romans 1:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Death is also represented by the cloths that He was
wrapped in. The cloths were used of bandages to wrap up a mortally wounded man.
These were death garments, probably left from someone who had previously died.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What was unique about this baby? If you were going into
an area to pick out a certain baby, how would you do it?  The shepherds were
bachelors for the most part. They needed a sign to identify this unique baby, a
baby wrapped in death clothes, a unique baby who would die a unique death. Luke
2:12. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;This will be a sign for you: you will find a baby
wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.&quot;&quot;  (Luke 2:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The application? You are alive, but you will die someday.
Do you have spiritual life, eternal life, or is it spiritual death for you? 
Prepare for death while you are alive by believing in Christ as your Savior.
Remember, Christmas is the birthday of His humanity, not His deity. His deity
is ageless. His humanity provided for our salvation, His deity for our eternal
life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Good News</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The term “gospel” means good news in the Greek. The
shepherds were under a ban. They were regarded by the Pharisees as being too
low to come to the synagogues or worship centers. The shepherds, however were
watching sacrificial “sheep” which would be used as animal sacrifices in the
temple. Every time a shepherd looked at a sheep, he was looking in shadow at
the Lamb of God who would die for the sins of mankind. A lamb was a visual for
an illiterate believer to picture the supreme sacrifice of all time. The
shepherds were startled when an angel stepped up to them suddenly in the same
area where David was called by God. Luke 2:8-11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“In the same region there were some shepherds staying out in
the fields and keeping watch over their flock by night. And an angel of the
Lord suddenly stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them;
and they were terribly frightened. But the angel said to them, &quot;Do not be
afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be for all
the people; for today in the city of David there has been born for you a
Savior, who is Christ the Lord.” (Luke 2:8-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Good news of great joy which will be for all the people”
is good tidings. The shepherds were given divine guidance in finding Christ.
John 3:16; Luke 2:12. </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For God so loved the world, that He gave His only
begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal
life.” (John 3:16, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;This will be a sign for you: you will find a baby
wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.&quot;” (Luke 2:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 2:8, “In the same region” means around Bethlehem.
These shepherds were under a religious ban. The Scribes and Pharisees had
banned them from coming into the temple. They could not attend the synagogues.
They were the scum of the earth to the proud Pharisees. Nothing is more
self-righteous, hypocritical and horrible than religion, man trying to save
himself.  But religion turned right around and took their sheep. Religion is
always inconsistent. We learn from the Mishnah and the Migdal, two Jewish sources,
that the sheep the shepherds were watching were used sacrificially in the
temple. And the sheep when sacrificed would depict the lamb of God who would
take away the sin of the world. It is significant that the angels appeared to
the shepherds who were watching the sheep, used in the Old Testament to portray
the Gospel. The angels didn’t appear to the Pharisees. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;In the same region there were some shepherds staying out
in the fields and keeping watch over their flock by night.&quot;  (Luke 2:8,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 2:9, “And an angel of the Lord suddenly stood
before them” actually says they stepped by their side suddenly. They were
probably sitting around a fire warming themselves on a cold night in the hill
country. The angel was much brighter than the fire, “and the glory of the Lord
shone around them.” </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And an angel of the Lord suddenly stood before them, and
the glory of the Lord shone around them; and they were terribly
frightened.&quot;  (Luke 2:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 2:10, “good news” means this is a night of good
news. The Gospel is the good news. But you say, “I don’t want anything to do
with religion.” But religion is not Christianity. Religion leaps only as high
as the old sin nature. The Gospel is what God does for man, not what man tries
to do for God. Well, you say, “I’m living a moral life and God will allow a
moral man to enter heaven.” The answer is definitely no. Never. Morality or
immorality have nothing to do with salvation.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But the angel said to them, &quot;Do not be afraid; for
behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be for all the
people;&quot;  (Luke 2:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In fact, as a believer a Christian morality makes no
impact for Christ. That doesn’t mean Christians are to be immoral, but morality
makes no impact. Why? Because many unsaved people can match the believer in
morality. That’s why good, moral, Christian people are often so spiritually
dead because they lack one thing. They lack Bible doctrine in their souls. They
lack the enabling power of the Holy Spirit which is how the Lord produces His
character and fruit in the believer’s spiritual life. It isn’t some wild-eyed
experience, it is the Holy Spirit giving your life inner attractiveness and
inner dynamics. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Gospel produces “great joy.” That is inner happiness,
inner joy. One really hasn’t had a merry Christmas until they have this inner
happiness. It comes from having realized Christ as personal Savior and
occupation with Christ. This occupation with Christ is what strengthens the
believer. Phil. 4:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I can do all things through Him who strengthens
me.&quot;  (Philippians 4:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 2:11, “there has been born for you a Savior”
refers to the unique God-Man, Jesus Christ. A member of the Godhead had to take
on the form of a real human being, becoming a member of the human race.
“Savior” refers to the humanity of Christ. “Lord” refers to the deity of
Christ.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;for today in the city of David there has been born for
you a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.&quot;  (Luke 2:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Heavenly Worship</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is angelic worship of the hero of the Angelic
Conflict – Jesus Christ. These are elect angels who are confirmed in their
holiness and direct their esteem toward God. For believers, their worship
should involve a grace mental attitude, concentration on the object of who is
Jesus Christ and continue to function under the grace apparatus for perception.
Luke 2:13.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of
the heavenly host praising God and saying,&quot;  (Luke 2:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Heavenly host” were a number of elect angels and they
had come to serenade the shepherds. The reason? The Angelic Conflict would soon
be permanently resolved by Jesus Christ coming into the world, going to the
Cross, and being our substitute by being judged by God the Father for the sins
of all mankind. There was worship and praise. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What is worship? Some may say, “It’s spooky stuff that
religious people go through to show they’re better than others.” No. In John
4:24, true and false worship is exposed. “In spirit” means to be in fellowship
with God the Holy Spirit. “In truth” means to assemble together to hear the
Word taught.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;God is spirit, and those who worship Him must
worship in spirit and truth.&quot;&quot;  (John 4:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Potential Salvation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Peace is based on a maximum number of believers taking in
doctrine daily, maximum security through a very strong military force, and
maximum adherence to the four Divine Institutions, volition, marriage, family,
and nationalism, which champion freedom. Luke 2:14. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Glory to God in the highest, And on earth peace
among men with whom He is pleased.&quot;&quot;  (Luke 2:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Only saved individuals have the true peace of the Lord in
their hearts. “Glory to God” refers to God the Father as the author of the
plan, God the Son who executed the plan by dying on the Cross, and God the Holy
Spirit who reveals it to us so we may act upon it.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Reverent Seeking</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>The shepherds believed the
angelic message. They were positive. They started their journey on the basis of
the message, “they came in a hurry.” They found what they were seeking. Here
are people who had never darkened the door of a synagogue or temple and this
information was given to them. Why? There were around that fire that night a
group of shepherds who were seeking. They had positive volition. As you gather
around the teaching of the Word of God, there is genuine seeking. Luke 2:15-16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When the angels had gone away from them into heaven, the
shepherds began saying to one another, &quot;Let us go straight to Bethlehem
then, and see this thing that has happened which the Lord has made known to
us.&quot; So they came in a hurry and found their way to Mary and Joseph, and
the baby as He lay in the manger.&quot;  (Luke 2:15-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The shepherds found very easily and very quickly the
right baby because He was dressed in death clothes (swaddling).</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Effective Witnessing</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The definition: good news. The boundaries: death, burial,
and resurrection. The confidence comes from knowing doctrine in the right lobe
of the soul. The application is no problem with Bible doctrine. It is harder to
give biblically than witness biblically. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When they had seen the Lord Jesus Christ, they went out
and told others. Have you told others? Have you earned the right to tell
others? Not the haphazard knocking on houses, going door to door, but there is
a legitimate witness and one of the greatest things that can happen at
Christmas time is for someone to tell you in appreciation, “I found Christ as
Savior through your witness, through your testimony.” Luke 2:17-18.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;When they had seen this, they made known the statement
which had been told them about this Child. And all who heard it wondered at the
things which were told them by the shepherds.&quot;  (Luke 2:17-18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 2:18, “all who heard it wondered at the things”
means the genuine Gospel (good news) rightly presented should have this effect.
But what muddies up the water is when you go to someone else and you think
witnessing is making an issue out of their bad habits, or tell them they must
give up certain things to be saved, or observe some taboos, the filthy five or
something, and start going to church, and turn respectable, be baptized, or
make a fool out of themselves in some church auditorium. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>None of these things are the issue. The only issue is the
Gospel, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. After salvation the issue is to learn
the Word and apply it to experience. For the first time, they heard the true
story not the phony legalism and pandering of the Pharisees, but the true issue
of the Gospel, salvation in the atoning work of Jesus Christ on the Cross.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Quiet Meditation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Luke 2:19, “Mary treasured” is the imperfect active
indicative intensive of <span lang=EL>συντηρε</span>́<span lang=EL>ω</span>
(suntēreō) and means to preserve, keep safe, keep close. Mary “pondered” is
the present active participle of <span lang=EL>συμβα</span>́<span lang=EL>λλω</span>
(sumballō) and means to keep throwing things together. She was dovetailing
Bible doctrine in her frame of reference. She knew what was going on and was
not wondering about them. She knew! She was thinking divine viewpoint. She had
her edification complex of the soul. She was a strong Christian. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But Mary treasured all these things, pondering them in
her heart.&quot;  (Luke 2:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is a lost art - the art of thinking divine
viewpoint. She kept on thinking, meditating, and reflecting on these things. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The principles above should be a part of your frame of
reference for a doctrinal Christmas! The principles of life and death, the good
news of salvation, heavenly worship, peace, positive volition, effective
witnessing, and frame of reference. </p>
