<h2><a name="_D-Communion,_the_Lord’s"></a><a name="_Communion,_the_Lord’s"></a>Communion,
the Lord’s Supper</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The communon table is a mandated ritual in the Church Age
which depicts our fellowship with Jesus Christ. This soul condition changes
based on whether the old sin nature controls the soul (state of sin or
carnality) or whether the Holy Spirit controls the soul following confession of
sin (state of spirituality). This is done repeatedly in the believer’s life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God’s Provision of Communion</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Communion is a provision designed by God in eternity past
to bring glory to the Lord. Communion was designed for blessing, not cursing. Communion
was designed for believers, not unbelievers. 1 Cor. 10:16; 1 Cor. 10:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Is not the cup of blessing which we bless a sharing in
the blood of Christ? Is not the bread which we break a sharing in the body of
Christ?&quot;  (1 Corinthians 10:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Communion was designed for believers in fellowship, not
believers out of fellowship. Communion was designed for glorifying God, not man.
1 Cor. 10:21-22; 1 Cor. 10:31.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of
demons; you cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons. Or
do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? We are not stronger than He, are we?&quot; 
(1 Corinthians 10:21-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do
all to the glory of God.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 10:31, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Communion was designed for honor, not dishonor. There is
a clear concept of rank, command, and authority. Communion was designed for
unity not divisions. In 1 Corinthians 11:18, “divisions” is <span lang=EL>σχι</span>́<span
lang=EL>σμα</span> (schisma) and means schisms, dissentions, divisions, a
cleft, a rent, a split. This is a choice based on negative volition, leading to
the willful embracing of false doctrine. 1 Cor. 11:1-16; 1 Cor. 10:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For, in the first place, when you come together as a
church, I hear that divisions exist among you; and in part I believe it.&quot; 
(1 Corinthians 11:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Since there is one bread, we who are many are one body;
for we all partake of the one bread.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 10:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Communion was designed for praise, not censure. This was
not a meal to get full. This was a ritual which symbolized the person and work
of Christ on the Cross. Communion was designed for obedience, not disobedience.
1 Cor. 11:21-22; 1 Cor. 11:24.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;for in your eating each one takes his own supper first;
and one is hungry and another is drunk. What! Do you not have houses in which
to eat and drink? Or do you despise the church of God and shame those who have
nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? In this I will not praise
you.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 11:21-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said,
&quot;This is My body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of
Me.&quot;&quot;  (1 Corinthians 11:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Communion was designed for participation, not ostracism. It
was designed for self-examination by the believer-priest not a church board. It
was designed for examination based on honesty if a person is out of fellowship.
Communion was designed for commendation, not condemnation. 1 Cor. 11:28; 1 Cor.
11:32-34.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But a man must examine himself, and in so doing he is to
eat of the bread and drink of the cup.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 11:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord so
that we will not be condemned along with the world. So then, my brethren, when
you come together to eat, wait for one another. If anyone is hungry, let him
eat at home, so that you will not come together for judgment. The remaining
matters I will arrange when I come.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 11:32-34, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Bread and the Cup in Communion</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 26:26, When Jesus Christ took the bread, it
represented Jesus Christ Himself, the bread of life. The breaking of the bread
is a picture of Jesus Christ bearing our sins. In the Old Testament, a lamb was
used in the Passover ritual that depicted the Savior to come – Jesus Christ. They
also used unleavened bread placed on the Table of Showbread located in the
tabernacle all depicting the Savior Jesus Christ. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;While they were eating, Jesus took some bread, and after
a blessing, He broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, &quot;Take,
eat; this is My body.&quot;&quot;  (Matthew 26:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Translation, “While they were eating, Jesus having taken
bread and having blessed it in prayer, broke it and having given it to the
disciples said, you take, you eat, this keeps on being my body.” You take and
you eat are both aorist active imperatives which are commands.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The blessing was done in the middle of a meal. It is a
new meal, a new dispensation. He said to eat. The bread represents the person
of Christ, the member of the Trinity, the God-Man with a destiny, the virgin
born, the incarnated Savior of mankind, but the soul of His humanity had no old
sin nature. Matt. 26:27.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And when He had taken a cup and given thanks, He gave it
to them, saying, &quot;Drink from it, all of you;&quot;  (Matthew 26:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 116:13, “cup of salvation” is the Passover cup,
a non - alcoholic wine (no leaven) and they drank from the cup to commemorate
the work of Christ, yet future. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;I shall lift up the cup of salvation And call upon the
name of the LORD.&quot;  (Psalms 116:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 20:22, the cup is filled with the sins of the
world and Christ drinks it thus bearing our sins. Jesus Christ was bearing our
sins! The Father judged those sins. Either accept Jesus Christ drinking for you
on the Cross, or accept wrath from God on yourself. Isaiah 53:4-6.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But Jesus answered, &quot;You do not know what you are
asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?&quot; They said
to Him, &quot;We are able.&quot;&quot;  (Matthew 20:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Surely our griefs He Himself bore, And our sorrows He
carried; Yet we ourselves esteemed Him stricken, Smitten of God, and afflicted.
But He was pierced through for our transgressions, He was crushed for our
iniquities; The chastening for our well-being fell upon Him, And by His
scourging we are healed. All of us like sheep have gone astray, Each of us has
turned to his own way; But the LORD has caused the iniquity of us all To fall
on Him.&quot;  (Isaiah 53:4-6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When He came in His First Advent, He drank the cup of the
judgment of our sins. When He comes again at the Second Advent, unbelievers
will drink the cup because they did not accept His drinking the cup for them.
This ritual depicts the work of Christ on the Cross.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Lord’s Supper and the New Covenant to Israel</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Matthew 26:28, “for this is My blood” means that the
cup represents His blood (His substitutionary spiritual death on the Cross) and
it will always represent the Blood of Christ. “The covenant” is <span lang=EL>διαθη</span>́<span
lang=EL>κη</span> (diathēkē) and means a compact, a covenant. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;for this is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out
for many for forgiveness of sins.&quot;  (Matthew 26:28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This word does not mean “testament.” The word actually
means two people placing something in a repository. In the time of Christ, it
was used for a will. He was in essence making out His will (the New Covenant)
and we share that will by believing in Christ. Jesus Christ prophesied His
Millennial Kingdom in Matthew 26:29. Note that He does not refer to the
contents of the cup as wine, but “fruit of the vine” because it was not
fermented, only boiled.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;But I say to you, I will not drink of this fruit of
the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in My Father's
kingdom.&quot;&quot;  (Matthew 26:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He will again have fellowship face to face with them in
His Millennial reign. 1 Cor. 11:26.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you
proclaim the Lord's death until He comes.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 11:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God's Promises and Grace Resources </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God has provided His so great salvation. John 14:1; John
14:6.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Do not let your heart be troubled; believe in God,
believe also in Me.&quot;  (John 14:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Jesus said to him, &quot;I am the way, and the truth, and
the life; no one comes to the Father but through Me.&quot;  (John 14:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s house is our house and we will spend eternity with
the Lord Jesus Christ. John 14:2-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;In My Father's house are many dwelling places; if
it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you.
&quot;If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to
Myself, that where I am, there you may be also.&quot;  (John 14:2-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Because all Church Age believers are priests, we
represent ourselves directly to God the Father  in prayer. John 14:13-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Whatever you ask in My name, that will I do, so
that the Father may be glorified in the Son. &quot;If you ask Me anything in My
name, I will do it.&quot;  (John 14:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All Church Age believers are indwelt by God the Holy
Spirit who functions to empower our spiritual life and is our helper, teacher,
mentor, and comforter. John 14:16-17; John 14:26. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another
Helper, that He may be with you forever; that is the Spirit of truth, whom the
world cannot receive, because it does not see Him or know Him, but you know Him
because He abides with you and will be in you.&quot;  (John 14:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father
will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your
remembrance all that I said to you.&quot;  (John 14:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the spiritual life, each of us can have the peace of
our Lord. John 14:27.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Peace I leave with you; My peace I give to you; not
as the world gives do I give to you. Do not let your heart be troubled, nor let
it be fearful.&quot;  (John 14:27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The whole grace package is tied up in our keeping His
commandments and reciprocating His love toward us.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Five Fellowships of Communion</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The entire context of the communion or the Lord’s Supper
stretches from 1 Corinthians 10:16 to 1 Corinthians 11:34. It is a passage
emphasizing at least five different fellowships that are important to the
Lord’s Supper.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Fellowship between the pastor and believers in his
congregation is accomplished by imitating the faith of the pastor-teacher and following
the Bible doctrine he teaches. In 1 Corinthians 11:1, “Be imitators” is the present
active imperative of <span lang=EL>μιμητη</span>́<span lang=EL>ς</span>
(mimētēs) and means an imitation of mental attitude toward the pastor. Heb.
13:7; Heb. 13:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Be imitators of me, just as I also am of Christ.&quot; 
(1 Corinthians 11:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Remember those who led you, who spoke the word of God to
you; and considering the result of their conduct, imitate their faith.&quot; 
(Hebrews 13:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch
over your souls as those who will give an account. Let them do this with joy
and not with grief, for this would be unprofitable for you.&quot;  (Hebrews
13:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You are to imitate the pastor in the use of confession of
sin and staying in fellowship. You imitate the pastor in the filling of the
Holy Spirit. You imitate him in the function of the grace apparatus for
perception. You imitate the pastor in staying out of emotional revolt,
reversionism, etc. You imitate him in having no mental attitude sins.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Fellowship between husband and wife is based upon the relationship
of the Father to the Jesus Christ, the relationship of Jesus Christ to the
husband. These relationships emphasize rank, authority and subordination. 1 Cor.
11:2-16.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But I want you to understand that Christ is the head of every
man, and the man is the head of a woman, and God is the head of Christ.” (1
Corinthians 11:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For a man ought not to have his head covered, since he is the
image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man.” (1 Corinthians
11:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“However, in the Lord, neither is woman independent of man, nor
is man independent of woman. For as the woman originates from the man, so also
the man has his birth through the woman; and all things originate from God.” (1
Corinthians 11:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Fellowship between believers in the local church is
accomplished by the absence of divisions. This accomplished by following the
teaching of Bible doctrine and therefore, being “like-minded” in the Word. In 1
Corinthians 1:10, “divisions” is <span lang=EL>σχι</span>́<span lang=EL>σμα</span>
(schisma) and means schisms, dissentions, divisions. 1 Cor. 1:11-19; 1 Cor.
4:1-17. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now I exhort you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ, that you all agree and that there be no divisions among you, but that
you be made complete in the same mind and in the same judgment.&quot;  (1
Corinthians 1:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Fellowship between believers and Bible doctrine is
accomplished by the removal of factious opinions that are contrary to the Bible
doctrine taught in the local church. These contrary or self-willed opinions are
removed as the believer matures spiritually and such false doctrines or
doctrinal opposition are replaced with <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the
right lobe of the soul. In 1 Corinthians 11:19, “factions” is <span lang=EL>αι</span>̔́<span
lang=EL>ρεσις</span> (hairesis) and is a self-willed opinion. A faction in the
local church is always connected to one person! If such a faction opposes what
the pastor is teaching, then such a faction should be handled by the deacon
board with corrective actions as appropriate.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For there must also be factions among you, so that those
who are approved may become evident among you.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 11:19,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Fellowship between believers and the person and work of
the Lord Jesus Christ is accomplished by confession of known sins to God the
Father and the resulting filling of the Holy Spirit. 1 Cor. 11:23.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered
to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which He was betrayed took
bread;&quot;  (1 Corinthians 11:23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Questions Regarding Communion </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Should we serve wine or grape juice? Grape juice should
be served because fermentation was the same as leaven and leaven was removed
from the Passover period.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Who is eligible to distribute the elements? Every Church
Age believer is a priest. Therefore, any believer has a right to distribute the
elements. However, in the framework of the local church, the administration is
responsible for their distribution.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Who is eligible to partake of the elements? Any believer
in fellowship with the Lord.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Biblically, who can take communion? Believers only and
they are commanded to be in fellowship with the Lord when they participate in
this Church Age ritual. 1 Cor. 11:2; 1 Cor. 11:27-28.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now I praise you because you remember me in everything
and hold firmly to the traditions, just as I delivered them to you.&quot;  (1
Corinthians 11:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the
Lord in an unworthy manner, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the
Lord. But a man must examine himself, and in so doing he is to eat of the bread
and drink of the cup.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 11:27-28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Can the Lord’s Supper be taken at home? Yes. For the
first 300 years, the believers in the Lord Jesus Christ did not meet in
buildings as we do now, but in homes, etc. For example, one church in Jerusalem
met in John Mark’s home or his mother’s home. They also meet in grottoes,
caves, open fields, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>How often should one partake of communion? There is no
stated time element in frequency of holding communion. The early church partook
of the Lord’s Supper every Lord’s day. Their entire service was different and
involved evening worship for three or four hours. In Acts 20:6-12, the service
was held at night and lasted all night. 1 Cor. 11:25.</p>

<p class=Verses>“We sailed from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread,
and came to them at Troas within five days; and there we stayed seven days. On
the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul
began talking to them, intending to leave the next day, and he prolonged his
message until midnight. There were many lamps in the upper room where we were
gathered together. And there was a young man named Eutychus sitting on the
window sill, sinking into a deep sleep; and as Paul kept on talking, he was
overcome by sleep and fell down from the third floor and was picked up dead.
But Paul went down and fell upon him, and after embracing him, he said, “Do not
be troubled, for his life is in him.” When he had gone back up and had broken
the bread and eaten, he talked with them a long while until daybreak, and then
left. They took away the boy alive, and were greatly comforted.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Acts
20:6-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“In the same way He took the cup also after supper, saying, “This
cup is the new covenant in My blood; do this, as often as you drink it, in
remembrance of Me.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 11:25, NASB)</p>
