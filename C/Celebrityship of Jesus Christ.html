<h2><a name="_D-Canon_of_Scripture"></a><a name="_D-Celebrityship_of_Jesus"></a>Celebrityship
of Jesus Christ</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the history of grace, there are many heroes, but only
one celebrity who is the source of all grace – Jesus Christ. Moses was an
example of a grace hero in his own dispensation, that is, in his own house. But
Christ is the celebrity who constructed and furnished the house. It started
with a man, Jesus Christ, the only grace celebrity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jesus Christ is the author and celebrity of this
dispensation, the Church Age. Moses was the hero of his dispensation, but Jesus
Christ is the unique person of the universe, the only celebrity of the Church
Age. Heb. 1:2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“God, after He spoke long ago to the fathers in the prophets in
many portions and in many ways,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 1:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Moses and only Moses is the emphasis as far as the
dispensation of the Age of the Jews is concerned. God used Adam, Methuselah,
Noah, Abraham, Joseph, Moses, Joshua, the judges, Elijah, David and on through
Jeremiah, Isaiah, and Ezekiel. But Moses tops the list because of his attitude
toward Bible doctrine. Moses was a genius, but he would have been just another
Mr. ordinary genius without Bible doctrine. Heb. 3:1-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling,
consider Jesus, the Apostle and High Priest of our confession; He was faithful
to Him who appointed Him, as Moses also was in all His house. For He has been
counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by just so much as the builder of the
house has more honor than the house. For every house is built by someone, but
the builder of all things is God. Now Moses was faithful in all His house as a
servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken later;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews
3:1-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The literal translation of Hebrews 3:1-5 is, “For which
reason holy members of the family of God, associates of the heavenly vocation,
concentrate on the Apostle even the High priest of our acknowledgement, Jesus.
Being faithful to the One (God the Father) having appointed Him as also Moses
in his entire house (the dispensation of Israel). For example, this one Jesus
Christ has been permanently evaluated, deserving of more glory than Moses by so
much as the One having constructed and furnished the house keeps on having more
honor than the house. For every house is constructed and furnished by the
agency of someone (like Moses in the age of Israel) by the One (Christ) having
constructed and furnished all things is God. Now Moses, in fact, was faithful,
dependable, and trustworthy in all his house (dispensation of Israel) as a
noble servant for evidence of things which are about to be communicated.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>David’s Confidence in the Celebrityship of Jesus
Christ </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Psalm 34 presents a spiritually mature believer, David,
returning from reversionism to fellowship with the Lord. This return involved
regaining the spiritual confidence in the celebrityship of Jesus Christ and the
trust in His protection and deliverance from the pursuing King Saul who wanted
to have him killed.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Psalm 34 is an acrostic Psalm with 22 verses. Some
background for Psalm 34 can be found in 1 Samuel 21. David was being pursued by
Saul and being protected by Jonathan. David became an actor and feigned
insanity. The Greeks wouldn’t touch the insane, so he was thrown out of Gath
and departed in disgrace. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>David was disoriented to God’s perfect provision. A
disoriented believer even though mature, can become the laughing stock of even
the unbeliever. Disorientation causes three overt manifestations - fear,
flight, and feigning. David then confesses his sins to God the Father and
recovers his spiritual life. 1 Sam. 21:12-13; 1 Sam. 21:15 - 1 Sam. 22:1. </p>

<p class=Verses>“David took these words to heart and greatly feared Achish king
of Gath. So he disguised his sanity before them, and acted insanely in their
hands, and scribbled on the doors of the gate, and let his saliva run down into
his beard.” (1 Samuel 21:12-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 34:1, “I will bless the Lord” means to adore
the Lord at all times. “Bless” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>בּרך</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>(bârak) and is a bona fide emotional appreciation of the Lord. “Praise”
is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>תּהלּה</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(tehillâh) and is a
bona fide doctrinal understanding of the essence of God. </p>

<p class=Verses>“A Psalm of David when he feigned madness before Abimelech, who
drove him away and he departed. I will bless the LORD at all times; His praise
shall continually be in my mouth.” (Psalms 34:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalm 34:2, “its boast” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>הָלַל</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(halal) and means a clear sound or color,
to shine, to be completely sold upon, to not be ashamed of. It is a quality
which permeates a healthy local church. The grace oriented shall “hear” and is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שׁמע</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(shâma‛) and means to concentrate, to
accept authority, to believe what is heard. “And rejoice” is an expression of
positive volition to doctrine, to celebrate, to express capacity for life. </p>

<p class=Verses>“My soul will make its boast in the LORD; The humble will hear
it and rejoice.” (Psalms 34:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalm 34:3, “O magnify” is the piel imperative of <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>גּדל</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(gâdal) and means to twist, to make
large, to assign to Jesus Christ greatness, the only grace celebrity. “The Lord
with me” refers to blessing by association. “Exalt His name” is the piel
imperfect of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>רוּם</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(rûm) and means to
be high, to rise or raise up, to promote. You honor Jesus Christ by knowing
Jesus Christ. Knowing Jesus Christ takes the content of Bible doctrine into
your soul. To get that content, you must take in doctrine in a consistent daily
basis. “Together” is a joint venture with David and other mature believers
exalting the Lord together. </p>

<p class=Verses>“O magnify the LORD with me, And let us exalt His name
together.” (Psalms 34:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalm 34:4, “I sought the Lord, and He answered me,
And delivered me” means that the Lord delivered David from a terrible
situation. You will get yourself into bad situations in your life. All of us
do. The combination of Satan’s world system around us and your old sin nature
tempting you does not have to outfox you, but they will because of your own
stupidity! Then what? You work out of the bad situation biblically using God's
grace resources and with a focus on consistent intake of Bible doctrine and remaining
in the spiritual life as much of the time as possible. You use <i>epignosis</i>
Bible doctrine in your soul and the enabling power of the Holy Spirit to
spiritually grow out of your problem areas – all by grace! </p>

<p class=Verses>“I sought the LORD, and He answered me, And delivered me from
all my fears.” (Psalms 34:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalm 34:5, “They looked to Him and were radiant” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>נָהַר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(nahar) and means to sparkle, to shine, to
be cheerful, the sheen of a running stream. This is restoration of fellowship,
appreciation of maturing spiritual status, and restored rapport love between
the Lord and the believer. </p>

<p class=Verses>“They looked to Him and were radiant, And their faces will
never be ashamed.” (Psalms 34:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalm 34:6, “This poor man cried” is today’s
equivalent of “O God, help me!” David was a mess. David was in reversionism.
“Saved him” refers to God’s provision of Bible doctrine, provision that was
made in eternity past! It is blasphemous to cry, “O God, help me!” He already
has! Problems are made by man, but God solves the problems!</p>

<p class=Verses>“This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him And saved him out
of all his troubles.” (Psalms 34:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalm 34:7, the Lord Jesus Christ is always showing up
when things are at an all-time low. Jesus Christ encamped around David. The
Lord took him back to basic doctrine and taught him. He did not counsel him. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalm 34:8, “O taste and see that the Lord is good”
refers to functioning under the grace apparatus for perception all the way to
spiritual maturity. This is literally, happinesses (plural) to the spiritually
mature believer who takes refuge in Him. </p>

<p class=Verses>“O taste and see that the LORD is good; How blessed is the man
who takes refuge in Him!” (Psalms 34:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalm 34:9, “fear” means to respect His authority.
“Saints” are spiritually mature believers. Literally, there is no deficiency to
those that respect Him. </p>

<p class=Verses>“O fear the LORD, you His saints; For to those who fear Him
there is no want.” (Psalms 34:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalm 34:10, “The young lions do lack and suffer
hunger” is in contrast to the previous verse. The young lions are analogous to
human ability and the strength of reversionism. This will never work. Those who
are constantly positive to doctrine under every circumstance (seek) shall never
lack of any good thing.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The young lions do lack and suffer hunger; But they who seek
the LORD shall not be in want of any good thing.” (Psalms 34:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalm 34:11, “Come” this is a qal imperative used for
positive volition to Bible doctrine.  “Children” are those under parental
authority. The best time to learn doctrine is when you’re young. “The fear of
the Lord” is respect for the Lord. When a person reaches spiritual maturity,
they have adoration and great praise for the Lord, but while they are growing
spiritually, they have respect for the Lord. You cannot love a person until you
respect them first! There is emotional love which is false and there is true
love which is marvelous and genuine. You have to know and respect and then
love. This is the order of any great love in life: know, respect, love.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Come, you children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of
the LORD.” (Psalms 34:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalm 34:12, “desires life” mean they want to enjoy
life. You are not normal if you don’t want to have fun in life and desire to
have happiness in life.  “Life” is in the plural and means “lives.” A life with
the Lord that overflows with everything in life. The answer is spiritual
maturity and occupation with the person of Christ. You can have a long life
with great happiness. “That he may see good” is to see the Lord in spiritual
maturity with all of the blessings that come to the mature believer. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Who is the man who desires life And loves length of days that
he may see good?” (Psalms 34:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalm 34:13, “Keep your tongue from evil” means that
when you have mental attitude sins in your soul, you’re not in fellowship with
the Lord. You are not growing spiritually. The mental attitude sins all lead to
trying to hurt someone. The sins of the tongue are designed to put someone down
against whom you have mental attitude sins. People who have no capacity for
life live by the lie. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Keep your tongue from evil And your lips from speaking
deceit.” (Psalms 34:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalm 34:14, “Depart from evil” is the qal imperative
of <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>סוּר</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(sûr) and means to
turn from reversionism. This is what David did after leaving Gath. “Do good” is
functioning under the grace apparatus for perception to the point of spiritual
maturity. “Seek peace” is the piel imperative and means to search for prosperity.
How? By consistently taking in and applying Bible doctrine to spiritual
maturity. This is pursuing doctrine, then prosperity pursues you. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Depart from evil and do good; Seek peace and pursue it.”
(Psalms 34:14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalm 34:15, “The eyes of the Lord” emphasize the fact
that the Lord is keeping His eyes on you to protect you, watching someone He
loves to protect them. “His ears are open to their cry” is exactly what
happened to David when he came out of Gath.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The eyes of the LORD are toward the righteous And His ears are
open to their cry.” (Psalms 34:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalm 34:16, “The face of the Lord is against
evildoers” is an anthropomorphism and is an expression of judgment on Doeg the
Edomite and King Saul.  2 Sam. 22:18-19.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The face of the LORD is against evildoers, To cut off the
memory of them from the earth.” (Psalms 34:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;He delivered me from my strong enemy, From those who
hated me, for they were too strong for me. &quot;They confronted me in the day
of my calamity, But the LORD was my support.” (2 Samuel 22:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalm 34:17, “cry” was when David was thrown out of
Gath. “Delivers them” means the Lord has delivered many others also.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The righteous cry, and the LORD hears And delivers them out of
all their troubles.” (Psalms 34:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalm 34:18, “The Lord is near to the brokenhearted”
means a heart shattered in pieces and refers to a reversionist like David when
he was thrown out of Gath. It means literally to deliver such as have a bruised
spirit. A bruised spirit is a believer in reversionism with all of the Bible
doctrine in their soul repressed and scarred over. </p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD is near to the brokenhearted And saves those who are
crushed in spirit.” (Psalms 34:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalm 34:19, “the righteous” is the spiritually mature
believer. After David reached spiritual maturity, many of the oppressed from
King Saul’s tyranny came to him in the cave of Adullam and the Lord delivered
David many times. Once you reach spiritual maturity, from time to time you are
going to have problems, disasters, heartaches, and face catastrophes. You are
to have the faith and confidence that the Lord will deliver you out of all of
them. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Many are the afflictions of the righteous, But the LORD
delivers him out of them all.” (Psalms 34:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalm 34:20, “He keeps all of his bones” has to do
with the Lord Jesus Christ who did not have any broken bones. It also refers to
David who will be protected from any real disaster. When people in battle had
their bones broken, they generally died. Jesus Christ came and was crucified on
the Cross without one broken bone in accomplishing His mission. David likewise
had a mission to rid Israel of the tyranny of King Saul, to restore the Land to
peace and prosperity under the laws of divine establishment and under the
influence of spiritually mature believers. That mission was accomplished
without David having one broken bone. </p>

<p class=Verses>“He keeps all his bones, Not one of them is broken.” (Psalms
34:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalm 34:21, “Evil shall slay the wicked” means that
if you stay in reversionism long enough it will destroy you. “Will be
condemned” means to be in great agony. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Evil shall slay the wicked, And those who hate the righteous
will be condemned.” (Psalms 34:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalm 34:22, Many times in history, God permits a
nation to go through great disasters and trials because they bring people into
the family of God as when unbelievers came to David at the Adullam cave and
were saved.  “None of those who take refuge in Him will be condemned” means
those who have been saved will not be antagonistic to mature believers, but
will become mature believers also.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD redeems the soul of His servants, And none of those
who take refuge in Him will be condemned.” (Psalms 34:22, NASB)</p>
