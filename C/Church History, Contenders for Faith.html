<h2><a name="_Church_History,_The_1"></a>Church History, The Contenders for the
Faith: the Apologists and Polemicists</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Apologists: </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Sought to refute false claims of cannibalism, incest,
indolence, anti-social actions. They developed a constructive approach by
showing that in contrast to Christianity, Judaism and pagan religion and state
worship were foolish and sinful. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Eastern Apologists:
</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Aristides</i>: Was a Christian philosopher. Wrote
comparing Christian, Chaldean, Greek, Egyptian, and Jewish forms of worship to
show the supremacy of the Christian form of worship. This was done in 140 AD. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Justin Martyr</i>: 100-165 AD. His first apology:
Urged the emperor to examine charges against Christians and free them from
legal disabilities if innocent. It contained morals, dogmas, Christ’s superior
life and an exposition of the worship of Christians. His second apology: He
sets forth that the good in men is due to Christ. Relation of decline of the
law to rise of the Gospel. Linking of the Logos, Christ, with God. Calling of
the Gentiles as people of God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Titian</i>: Denounced Greek pretensions to cultural
leadership. Christianity superior to Greek religion and thought. Compares
Christianity with Greek mythology and thought. Has the earliest harmony of the
Gospels called the Diatessaron. Athenagoras: professor of Athens. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He wrote Supplication for the Christians 180 AD. Stated
the charges made against Christians. Refuted the charge of atheism made against
the Christians because they would not go along with the pagan gods. Set forth
that the pagan gods were merely human creations and were guilty of things like
as their worshippers. Sets forth the plea for clemency from the emperor because
the claims made against the Christians were false. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Theophilus of Antioch</i>: 180 AD. Was converted by
reading the Scriptures. Wrote the Apology to Autolycus in 180 AD. Autolycus was
a pagan magistrate whom Theophilus wrote concerning the Christian faith. This
work attempted to win this magistrate to the Christian faith through reasoning.
It contained several books: The first book discussed the superiority and nature
of God. The second book compared the weakness of the pagan religions with the
strength of Christianity. The final book contained the answers to the
objections of Autolycus to the Christian faith. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'><u>Western Apologists: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>The emphasis was more on the
distinctiveness and finality of Christianity rather than comparative as was the
Eastern Apologists.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'><i>Tertullian</i>: He was a Roman
and trained in Greek and Latin. He knew the Classics and was a proficient
lawyer. He taught public speaking and practiced law. He became a Montanist in
202 AD. He gave himself to write a sound theology and refute the pagan false
philosophy set against Christianity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'><i>Tertullian’s Apologeticus</i>:
Was written to the Roman governor of his province. Argues that Christians are
loyal citizens. Argues that persecution doesn’t work but seems to cause the
Christians to multiply. Argued that the state was attacking the Church on shaky
legal grounds because the standard of belief and life of the Christians was
higher than the surrounding nations. The Christians were embarrassing and
exposing the others.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>Observation: The basic
contribution of the Apologists whether Eastern or Western was to shed light
upon the Christian thought of the middle of the second century.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'><b>The Polemicists: </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>The basic difference between the
Apologists and the Polemicists was in their purpose. The Apologist sought to
give a rational explanation of Christianity to the authorities present. The
Polemicists sought to challenge and refute the false teachings, teachers, and
heresies. The eastern mind gave itself to speculative theology. The western
mind, more pragmatic, gave itself to problems of policy in the church and
problems related to more practical theology.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'><u>Irenaeus, the anti-gnostic
Polemicist: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>Was bishop of Gaul. 180 AD and
after. Wrote Adversus Haereses in five books to refute gnostic teaching.  Book
#1: This is the best source of teaching of Gnosticism, written to Valentinian,
head of the Egyptian gnostic school. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>Book #2: Emphasized the unity of
God in distinction to the demiurge idea of God. Book #3: Refutes Gnosticism by
the Scriptures and tradition in this book. Emphasizes the organic unity of the
church through a “succession of leaders from Christ.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>Bock #4: This book condemns the
teaching of Marcion by the use of the words of Christ. Book #5: This is
vindication of the doctrine of Resurrection against which the gnostic were
united because of their concept that matter is evil. They had no room for
another body in eternity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The school of thought and instruction, eastern and
western: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i><u>The
Alexandrian School: eastern thought, in Alexandria. </u></i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Their objective was to give to Christianity a system of
theology by philosophical method. Their leaders were trained in literature and
philosophy. They did not emphasize a grammatical-historical system of
interpretation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Their system of interpretation included the belief that
the Scriptures had more than one meaning and wasn’t concerned with the meaning
of the writer of Scripture, but was to look for the “hidden meaning.” Their
conclusions often came up weird and absurd as to theological interpretation and
contained many un-Scriptural ideas. The men associated with this school of
instruction were Clement and Origen. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Clement: (not Clement of Rome) a Christian philosopher. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He sought to show Christianity as the final great
philosophy as he related it to the Greek philosophy. His writings:</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Protrepticus: 190 AD. Written to show the superiority of
true Christianity so pagans would accept it. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paedagogus: Instruction in morals for young Christians.
Shows Christ as the true teacher of the rules for life. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Stromata: several books. Book #1: The Christian is
presented as the true gnostic and Christianity as the true philosophy. Book #2:
Christian morality is superior to pagan morality. Book #3: Book on Christian
marriage. Book #4, 5, 6: Disposition unknown currently. Book #7, 8: Pictures
the religious life of the believer. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Origen: a pupil of Clement, above described: </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Was in leadership position at the Alexandrian school from
203-232 AD. He succeeded Clement as the head of the Alexandrian school at the
age of 18 years. He was brilliant. His writings are estimated at over 6,000
works.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>His life habits: very ascetic, simple and included sleeping
on bare board floors. He was the basic originator of studies in textual
criticism. This occurs in his Hexapla where he has several Hebrew and Greek
versions of the Scriptures arranged in parallel columns. In Hexapla, Origen
sought to render an accurate representation of the original text of Scripture.
This led to more exegetical study in later reformation times. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He wrote, Against Celsus, an answer to the charge that
Christians were irrational and the charge that the historical basis of
Christianity was lacking. He answered it by showing the change of conduct by
Christians, the openminded investigations for the truth by Christians and their
purity and influence. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>His great work is De Principiis, 230 AD. This is the
first Christian systematic theology. He developed the allegorical system of
interpretation. Taught that Christ was continually generated from the Father
and subordinate to Him. Believed in the pre-existence of the soul. Believed in
the final restoration of all spirits. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'><i><u>The Carthaginian School:
the western school. </u></i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>Their objective: They were
interested in practical matters of organization and government of the church
and doctrines regarding the Church. Their leaders were Tertullian and Cyprian. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>Tertullian: </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>Refer to information in section
on Western Apologists. Defended Christianity against false charges. Wrote
pamphlets and books on practical matters, dress, ornaments for women,
separation from pagan amusements, immorality, idolatry. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>He was the founder of the Latin
Theology. He was the first to state the theological doctrine of the trinity,
which was done in 215 AD in his work, Adversus Praxean. He emphasized the
distinctions between the persons of the Father and the Son.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>He also set forth the Traducian
doctrine of the origin of the soul. (The soul is passed on at conception in the
reproductive process.) He emphasized greatly the rite of baptisms and also that
sins after baptism were mortal sins. He used the word “trinity” in reference to
the essence of God. This doctrine of the trinity is probably his greatest
contribution to Christianity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>Cyprian: 200 AD </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>Born of wealthy parents and
educated in rhetoric and law. Became a Christian in 246 AD. Became a bishop of
Carthage in 251 AD and maintained that position until martyred in 258 AD. He
was an administrator and organizer. His greatest work: De Unitate Catholicae
Ecclesiae. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>He made a clear distinction
between the bishop and the elder. The bishop was defined as the center of unity
in the church to guard against schism. He did not affirm Peter’s bishopric in
Rome. He did, however, emphasize the primacy of Peter in the succession of
apostles down through Church history. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>His major influence was from his
doctrine of apostolic succession, the primacy of the Roman bishop, over the
other bishops. The primacy of the bishop of Rome was stated in the descriptive
phrase, “the first among equals.” </p>
