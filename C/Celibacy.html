<h2>Celibacy </h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Bible makes provision for happiness in single status
as well as in marriage. There are four factors in the concept of single status.
First, there is the gift of celibacy where there is either no normal operation
of libido in the life or they are able to control waves of libido with no
problem. Second, there is the operation of the Law of Supreme Sacrifice under
which Paul operated. 1 Cor. 9:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do we not have a right to take along a believing wife, even as
the rest of the apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas?”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Corinthians 9:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Third, the concept of the eunuch as set forth in Matthew
19:10-12. There are three categories of eunuchs. The congenital eunuch is one
who lacks the ordinary waves of libido (sexual desire) at normal times in life.
Then there are those who become eunuchs through emasculation (castration).
Lastly, there are those that freely choose to remain in single status or are
applying the Law of Supreme Sacrifice.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The disciples said to Him, “If the relationship of the man
with his wife is like this, it is better not to marry.” But He said to them, “Not
all men can accept this statement, but only those to whom it has been given. “For
there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother’s womb; and there
are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men; and there are also eunuchs who made
themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to
accept this, let him accept it.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 19:10-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Fourth, the concept involving those who have married, but
are now single and have advanced in age. They are enjoined to devote time to
prayer and to other things which are important in the Lord’s service. It also
states in this passage that it is better for the younger women to marry. 1 Tim.
5:9-10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“A widow is to be put on the list only if she is not less than
sixty years old, having been the wife of one man, having a reputation for good
works; and if she has brought up children, if she has shown hospitality to
strangers, if she has washed the saints’ feet, if she has assisted those in
distress, and if she has devoted herself to every good work.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Timothy 5:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Now that we understand that there is a bonafide single
status, believers who are married should stop “looking down their noses” at
people who have advanced a little in age and yet are not married. Married or
single status should not be the basis of social acceptability. When a person is
a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ, their marital status should not be a basis
of fellowship.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The gift of celibacy takes away the libido factor and
replaces it with a response and counter response between a person with the gift
of celibacy and God, whereby they can have more spiritual productivity. No one
should feel sorry for the celibate. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The greatest example of the gift of celibacy is the
Apostle Paul. Paul found in the Lord inner happiness and fulfillment. Paul was
capable of marvelous production and operation. See category of <a
