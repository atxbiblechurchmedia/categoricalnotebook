<h2>Communion Emphasis</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The words of dying men are always held in memory. When
two of the greatest men of history were ready to die, they recorded their
thoughts in two books. The men were Peter and Paul. The books were 2 Peter and
2 Timothy. They both referred to the days in which we are now living in some
detail, 2 Timothy 3:1-9 and 2 Peter 3:1-9. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Any idiot can mock and any idiot can scoff. Any fool can
laugh at judgment, at hell, at the Lake of Fire. A fool that is! But 2 Peter
3:9 says God can save mockers, scoffers, idiots and fools. God can salvage any
member of the human race. God’s tools in salvage are a cross and a crown, but
the Ccross has to come before the crown. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some count
slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing for any to perish but for all
to come to repentance.&quot;  (2 Peter 3:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Communion emphasizes the true Person and Word of Christ.
Christ is the Savior and it is He who is illustrated through the bread (His
person) and through the blood (His work). 1 Cor. 10:16.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Is not the cup of blessing which we bless a sharing in
the blood of Christ? Is not the bread which we break a sharing in the body of
Christ?&quot;  (1 Corinthians 10:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>People are not saved because they believe in God, go to
church, are good people, are sincere, are honest, help their mean neighbors,
love children, love dogs and cats and white mice, are dedicated, live
sacrificial lives, smile all the time, have suffered a hard life, are nice
people, are civic minded, put the roof on the church building, donated land to
a church, are not hypocrites, tithe, live in a Christian nation and don’t cuss.
There is only way whereby you can be saved and that is believe on the Lord Jesus
Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Communion emphasizes true unity. One bread represents
unity and doesn’t come through integration. One body means unity and doesn’t
come through legislation that is supposed to make everyone equal. Unity doesn’t
come by everyone getting together to settle their differences or by
negotiating. Unity comes through salvation and spirituality. It comes through
the teaching of Bible doctrine. 1 Cor. 10:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Since there is one bread, we who are many are one body;
for we all partake of the one bread.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 10:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Communion emphasizes true fellowship. False fellowship is
based on compatibility of old sin natures, common interests, common hates, and
social panaceas. Nothing will match the fellowship that is produced by the filling
of the Holy Spirit. 1 Cor. 10:17-19.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Since there is one bread, we who are many are one body;
for we all partake of the one bread. Look at the nation Israel; are not those
who eat the sacrifices sharers in the altar? What do I mean then? That a thing
sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?&quot;  (1
Corinthians 10:17-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Holy Spirit produces the character of Christ in the
believer’s life as they grow spiritually. He produces the fruit of the Spirit.
He conforms the believer unto the image of Christ. Gal. 4:19; Gal. 5:22-23; Rom.
8:29. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;My children, with whom I am again in labor until Christ
is formed in you—&quot;  (Galatians 4:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,
patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against
such things there is no law.&quot;  (Galatians 5:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become
conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many
brethren;&quot;  (Romans 8:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Holy Spirit gives a relaxed mental attitude while in
fellowship. Nothing can begin to match genuine Christian fellowship. No club,
or service organization, no group, no matter how high and noble their purpose
can duplicate the fellowship that believers have with the Lord and one another.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Communion emphasizes true Bible doctrine. Doctrine used
many times in Scripture speaks of Bible teachings. Accurate and correct
doctrine is possible in Bible interpretation. But there is also the false. 1
Cor. 11:19; 1 Tim. 4:1-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For there must also be factions among you, so that those
who are approved may become evident among you.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 11:19,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some
will fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and
doctrines of demons, by means of the hypocrisy of liars seared in their own
conscience as with a branding iron, men who forbid marriage and advocate
abstaining from foods which God has created to be gratefully shared in by those
who believe and know the truth.&quot;  (1 Timothy 4:1-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Communion emphasizes true procedure. All things need to
be done decently and in order. 1 Cor. 11:20-22; 1 Cor. 11:34; 1 Cor. 14:40.
Bible teaching pushes out its own program. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore when you meet together, it is not to eat the
Lord's Supper, for in your eating each one takes his own supper first; and one
is hungry and another is drunk. What! Do you not have houses in which to eat
and drink? Or do you despise the church of God and shame those who have
nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? In this I will not praise
you.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 11:20-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, so that you
will not come together for judgment. The remaining matters I will arrange when
I come.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 11:34, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But all things must be done properly and in an orderly
manner.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 14:40, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Communion emphasizes true hope of the Rapture for the
Church and the Second Advent for Israel. 1 Cor. 11:26. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you
proclaim the Lord's death until He comes.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 11:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Communion emphasizes true confession of sin. 1 Cor.
11:27-28.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the
Lord in an unworthy manner, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the
Lord. But a man must examine himself, and in so doing he is to eat of the bread
and drink of the cup.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 11:27-28, NASB)</p>
