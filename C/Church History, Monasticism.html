<h2><a name="_Church_History,_Monasticism"></a>Church History, Monasticism</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Causes of Monasticism </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The origin of the meaning of Monasticism originated with
the Greek word <span lang=EL>μο</span>́<span lang=EL>νος</span> (monos) meaning
“living alone.” This life was characterized by poverty, chastity, and
obedience. It was also a life lived in common to a particular rule. It was
lived in seclusion. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Origin: movement and periods of monasticism: Fourth
century: laymen leave community church and go live the hermit life. 10th-11th
century: monastic reforms invoked. 13th century: the little Friar monks, little
fat monks, middle ages begin. The counter reformation: reformation within the
Roman Catholic church to counteract the Protestant Reformation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Philosophical influence: primarily Gnosticism. The dual
philosophy, matter is evil and spirit is good. Led to asceticism by the monks.
Deprive the body, free the soul from it. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Scriptural” separation doctrine: They read more into 1
Corinthians 7 than was there. They read celibate life into it, for example. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Psychological causes: retreat from problems and harsh
realities of life. To escape the morals and contamination of the times, and a
more individualistic approach to God. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Historical causes: deterioration of the Roman Empire
caused despair of social reform. Thus, many ran from the immorality. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Geographical: Monasticism took place in the East at the
beginning where climate was conducive to outdoor living.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Development stages of Monasticism</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The origin was the ascetic practices of the church. The
second stage was the withdrawal from society. The third stage might be called
the “attraction”, this being found in the “holy” life of the hermit. The fourth
stage was that of the organized communal type of living.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Different kinds of Monasticism</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Oriental Monasticism: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Asia Minor there were celibates both male and female
devoted to the major gods and goddesses, like Cybele, the Great Mother, and
Demeter. The Jews had the monastic group called the Essenes to which John the
Baptizer belonged.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Christian Monasticism: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This originated in the practice of Christians before any
organized efforts existed. At an early date, some believers began to abstain
from marriage with the practice based on 1 Corinthians 7. The asceticism,
deprival from meat and drink, for spiritual reasons was taken from passages
such as 1 Corinthians 8. Others took passages on prayer, meditation, or charity
and made those the focal points of their lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Founders of Monasticism</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The founder of Christian Monasticism, Anthony (250-356 AD
) was an ascetic, lived in Egypt about 250 AD and was one of many there. He
retired in 285 AD to an old fort and lived in seclusion on the Nile for about
20 years. He was persuaded to allow others to join him and to lead them. This
he did according to fourth century tradition.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Monasticism of St. Pachomius: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Founder of the first real monastery in 320 AD at
Tabennisi on the Nile.  A real monastery or convent is called a coenobium. From
the Greek κοινός (koinos) and <span lang=EL>βιος</span> (bios) meaning a
common life. He established one monastery for women and about 10 for men with
about 7000 monks in this order.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Asia Minor Monasticism: 390-459 AD. </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This form was very practical hermitical, that is, a life
lived in a more individualistic way, by one’s self.  An example of this kind of
Monasticism was Simion Stylites who sat on a little platform surrounded by a
railing on top of a 60-foot pole or column for 30 years. Stylites preached from
this pole, met the dignitaries there and from which he had great influence. The
term Stylites comes from the Greek word for pillar, stylites.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Greek Monasticism, from St. Basil the Great: 329-379
AD.  </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>St. Basil was the founder of Monasticism in the Eastern
or Greek Church. He adapted the rule of Eustathius to the Greek ideals. His
order was known as the Basilians.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Roman Monasticism: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>St. Athanasius took two monks to Rome in 340 AD. From
this simple beginning, the monastic impulse moved west from Italy to Gaul to
North Africa.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Benedictine Monasticism: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The actual founder of Western Monasticism and its founder
Benedict of Nursia, 480-543 AD. Basic tenets of this brand of Monasticism were
work, same law and order for all members including the abbot, the corporation
monastery and monk were united for life. It was a loose knit organization of
chapters called abbeys with their heads called abbots.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Irish Monasticism: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>St. Columba founded an order of monks similar to the
Greeks and Egyptian orders. These orders could be called austere, mystical, and
pious. One predominant characteristic was that they were great missionaries.
Dates for this: 521-597 AD. They evangelized Scotland, North England, North and
Central Europe. The Benedictines evangelized the rest of Europe. Irish
Monasticism finally succumbed to the Benedictine rule by the eight century.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>In 910 AD, William I the Pious, Duke of Guienne
founded a monastery at Cluny.  </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The second abbot of Cluny obtained certain papal
privileges. He was named Odo. He made it a great center of religious revival
and won over the Benedictines of Monte Cassino and Subiaco. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>By 1150 AD about 400 monasteries from Scotland to Poland,
Italy to Palestine had affiliated with him at the Cluny monastery. The abbot of
Cluny became the absolute head of all the monasteries of the affiliations and
had total control over its 10,000 monks. This affiliation of monks became rich
and declined after 1350 and disbanded in 1790 AD.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Calmaldulian Hermits: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This was a hermitical order founded by St. Romuald who at
the age of 20 entered a monastery of St. Apollinaire in 970 AD. He later left
the monastery, joined a group of hermits near Venice and desired to reestablish
Egyptian and Syrian hermit orders. His followers later became monks. Presently
the order had both hermits and monks.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Cistercian Order: 1098 AD.  </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>It was founded by St. Robert of the Benedictine order in
France. They were called “white or gray monks” because of their clothing. It
had two outstanding heads to its order. St. Stephen Harding: 1109-1134 AD. St.
Bernard of Clairvaux: 1134-1154 AD. Their major thrust was to reestablish the
rule of Benedict. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They made contributions to agriculture and stock
breeding. By 1154, there were 230 chapters in this order. By 1200, there were
over 500 abbeys. This order was nearly wiped out by the Reformation of the 16th
century and the revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>After the 19th century, they had a revival in their
order. They are divided into three groups:  Common Observance: mainly in
Austria and Hungary with 30 monasteries. Middle Observance: with 15
monasteries. Strict Observance: Trappists with 60 monasteries, part in Canada
and some in Normandy.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Augustine Monasticism: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Rule of Augustine: from Epistle 211, written to some
nuns and became the basis for the expanded rule later attributed to his name. 
Have several groups: Augustian Canons: were a preaching order and went under
several names: Austin Canons, Canons Regular, and Black Canons. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Augustian Hermits or Friars: 1200-1250 AD. Organized by
the Pope to bring spiritual unity into the Augustinian Order. Had a general
elected by the chapter and provincial officers, assistants and definitors, and
visitors.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Evaluation of Monasticism </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The contributions made by Monasticism: Became an
experimental farm. Kept scholarship alive by means of education and copying
manuscripts. Became repositories for great works, collecting them. Kept records
and histories. Monks became missionaries. Became the refuge for outcasts of
society. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Negative contributions: Brought adverse effects on
Christian society. Too many of the best men and women were drained off of
society. The great men were in the monasteries. The celibate life, practically
eliminated the posterity of the intelligent. It created a double, standard, one
for the monk, and one for the common man. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Brought adverse effects on the individual. Produced
spiritual pride. Produced laziness, gluttony, avarice, wealth and this became
the character of the monk. Brought adverse effects on the church by developing
the hierarchy system.</p>
