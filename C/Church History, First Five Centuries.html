<h2><a name="_The_Church,_Chronological_1"></a><a
name="_Church_History,_Highlights"></a>Church History, Highlights of The First
Five Centuries</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The following facts are designed to underline the ever
present hand of God in history in the accomplishing of His will on earth. God’s
sovereignty is seen in many wonderful ways of revelation, inspiration,
preservation, etc. This categorical and chronological view of the centuries
will express in brief this great supreme concept.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>0-100 AD </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Roman Empire dominating the then known world. This is
the 4th Great Gentile Power of the book of Daniel.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Birth of Christ in 4 BC, the entrance of the Messiah
on the scene as the Savior of the world. His Crucifixion and Ascension 32 AD.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Birth of the Church 32 AD and Apostolic Age.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The evangelization of the then known world by the apostles
and the writing of Scripture.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The entire revelation of God given with the writing of
the Book of Revelation. 96 AD</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Localized persecution, mainly from the Jewish leaders,
but going to an empire basis by the time of Nero in 64-68 AD.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One of the main heresies in the Church was Gnosticism.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Papyrus rolls were the materials for manuscripts up
through the first century.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>100-200 AD </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The First Organized Persecution of the Church: 112 AD
under the influence of Pliny the Younger of Bithynia.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Persecutions were not to be a big part in the life of the
Christians in the second century.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One of the characteristics of the second century were the
Writings polemical and apologetical of the Church Fathers. The Apologists
sought to show Christianity in its supremacy to the other religions by the
comparison method in part; while the polemicists sought to refute directly the
heresies charged against the Christians.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The second century became the temporal sphere of the two
schools of thought which were going to influence the doctrine and policy of the
church. These wore the Eastern school, the Alexandrian school in Alexandria,
and the Western school, the Carthaginian school in Carthage.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The second century, had its heresies also Gnosticism left
over from the first century, the Ebionite heresy, about 132-135 and longer;
Montanism by Montanism, 135-160 AD.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Probably one of the most singularly important things in
the second century is the establishment of the Canon of Scripture. The first
canon, the Canon of Marcion, of 140 AD and the second canon, the Muratorian
Canon of 170 AD. Actually, Textual Criticism had its birth in this century. The
gathering of all the Scriptures was complete by 175 AD and the compilation by
180 AD.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Another major factor was the great amount of literary
work done. This was mentioned under the Polemical and Apologetical writings but
included many more literary facets than just these general expressions.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The second century provided one of the leaders in the
soon to be developed Episcopate. This was Ignatius in Syria: 107-115 AD.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Papyrus Codices (books) were used in second through
fourth centuries.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>200-300 AD</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the third century the development of the Episcopacy is
going to be a big factor. We find two more important men arising in key
locations of power to bring by word and pen a greater development in the power
structure of the church. Ireneus in Gaul, 202: and Cyprian in North Africa in
258-AD.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the third century the persecution of the Church
reached the Emperor’s level with two major Emperor-directed persecutions. The
first by Decius in 250 AD and the second by Diocletian began in 285 AD and
climaxing with the Edict of 303 AD, moving into the next century.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The third century had its heresies: Manicheanism,
Monarchianism, and also the Easter controversy. Some were philosophical,
theological and Christological.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The third century provided the First Christian Systematic
Theology written by Origen, a pupil of Clement who was a Christian philosopher
in the Eastern Alexandrian school.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The real founder of Textual Criticism, Origen, mentioned
above, got the ball rolling on Textual Criticism with his “Hexaple” where he
had several Hebrew and Greek versions of the Scriptures arranged in parallel
columns. This was designed to produce an accurate Original text of theological
thought.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Literature was also a big factor in the third century and
much of it coming from the leaders of the two schools of theological thought.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>By this time, the Roman Empire was divided into three
sections with Antioch being the capital city of the Syrian section: Alexandria,
the capital city of Egypt; and Rome the capital of central and lower Italy, and
indefinite boundaries. This is going to effect the development of the
Episcopacy coming up in the fourth century.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Monasticism began also in the east founded by Anthony:
250-356 AD.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Gospels were divided into long and short sections.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>300-400 AD</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This fourth century could be called a century of
Climactic Action.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fourth century begins a new chapter of Church History
with the Supremacy of the Old Catholic Imperial Church.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The century started off with the persecution of
Diocletian in 303 AD who in his edict ordered the cessation of meetings, of
Christians, ordered the destructions of the churches, and the deposing of the
officials of the churches; resulting in the imprisonment of Christians and the
destructions of the Scriptures by fire.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The second great thing was the easing of tension by the
next Emperor Galerius in 311 AD who gave toleration to the Christians to
worship, as long as they were peace abiding.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The next major factor was the Edict of Milan made by
Constantine who brought freedom of worship to all religions including
Christianity in the Empire.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Church began to be involved directly and openly in
two major ways: The first being the development of the Episcopate; and the
second, the holding of the Councils to decide issues.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Development of the Episcopate is seen in the
development of the rank system of the bishops during the fourth century. There
were basic levels of bishops (pastors). The lowest, the country bishop; the
second, the city bishop; next, the bishop of the capital city of the province;
the bishop of the apostolic mother church; and lastly the bishops of the three
capital cities which were both political capitals as well as apostolic mother
churches. These were Antioch, Alexandria and Rome.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Another factor looming in the fourth century was the
church “councils” the chronological listing of the Councils of the 4th century
and their issues: Council of Nicea in 325 AD - settled the issue on
relationship of Christ as the Son to the Father. Council of Laodicea in 363 AD
- decreed that only canonical books should be used in the churches. Council of
Constantinople in 381 AD - reaffirmed the Council of Nicea’s decision and
clarified the Holy Spirit relation, asserted humanity of Christ. Council of
Carthage in 397 AD - decreed the 27 books of the present New Testament to be
canonical.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The 4th century was a century of evangelistic and
missionary endeavors:  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ulfilas missionary to the Goths: 311-381 AD. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Martin of Tours: missionary to the Burgundians, 311-396
AD.  Missions had produced the British Celtic Church by the Council of Arles in
314 AD.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the 4th century there was a great buildup and
expression of Church - State relations. The influence of the church on the
state was seen in the cessation of the gladiatorial shows, the dignity of woman
increased, the slaves received better treatment, Roman legislation was more
just and missionary work was speeded up. The effect of the state on the church
was seen in the interference in the life of the church by men such as Constantine
who as Emperor restored church property, subsidized the church financially,
exempted the clergy from public office, banned soothsaying, and set aside
Sunday for the Empire as a day of rest, and intervened at the Council of Nicea
in 325 AD. Julian set the Church back. Theodicius made Christianity the
exclusive religion of the Empire in 380 AD and in 395 AD, Christianity was
recognized as the official and only religion of the Roman State. Justinian
closed the school of Philosophy in Athens, and this was the final stroke at
Paganism.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Jerome wrote the Latin Vulgate, a Latin translation of
the Bible, 382 AD.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Eusebius founded Church history with an Ecclesiastical
history, the survey of the church, 324 AD and a universal history from the time
of Abraham to 323 AD.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Monasticism which began with Anthony in the third century
continued with Pachomius organizing the first monastery about 320 AD at
Tabinnisi (Sometimes spelled Tabinna).</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>After 313 AD, pilgrimages became a part of worship.
Christmas was officially accepted and cleansed of pagan significance by 350 AD.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fourth century provided two more canonical cook lists
the African list of 360 AD and the Athanasius list of 367 AD.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>After 313 AD, the Christians met in buildings built on
the style of the Roman Basilica, an oblong building.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Visigoths defeat the eastern part of the Roman Empire in
378 AD at Battle of Adrianople.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Century of the writing of Siniatic and Vatican
manuscripts, possibly Washinton manuscript also.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Vellum and parchment used as material for printing -
fourth through eighth centuries.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 381 AD, The Council of Constantinople gave primacy to
Bishop of Rome, placing him in primacy.     </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>400-500 AD</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Visigoths sack Rome in 410 AD.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Visigoths founded the kingdom of Spain in 426 AD, </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Lombards, Burgundians, and Franks crossed the Rhine and
settled in modern France, in fifth century.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>By 458 AD, the Epistles of Paul were divided into
sections for public reading.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The fifth century is the time of the writing of the
Alexandrian and the Ephraem Greek manuscripts of the New Testament.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Missionary during this time - Patrick to the Celts of
Ireland, 432-461 AD.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Church Council continued to meet. Council of Hippo
verified the same decree of the Council of Carthage accepting the 27 present
books of the New Testament as Canonical, 419 AD.  Council of Ephesus unity of
Christ’s personality, refuted Pelagianism, 451 AD.  Council of Chalcedon
decided on the Monophysite controversy.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Emperor Valentinian III in 445 AD recognized the
primacy of the Roman bishop in spiritual matters.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One of the predominant factors of the fifth century was
the fall in 476 AD of Rome. By 500 AD the Roman empire in the west no longer
existed. There are many reasons for the fall of the Roman Empire. </p>
