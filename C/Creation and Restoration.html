<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Original Creation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The time of the original creation by the Lord Jesus
Christ is unknown. In Genesis 1:1, the word “created” or <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>בָּרָא</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> (bara) in the Hebrew means to create out of nothing. God the
Son spoke a single word unknown millions of years ago and the universe was
formed instantaneously. It took Jesus Christ less than a second. The original
creation was made by God the Son out of nothing and was perfect and beautiful.
Prior to God the Son’s action, nothing existed but God the Father, God the Son
and God the Holy Spirit who are spirit, not of material substance.</p>

<p class=Verses>“In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis
1:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Psalms 33:6, “by the word of the Lord” means it was
instantaneous. In Hebrews 11:3 and 2 Peter 3:5, “the word of God” also means it
was instantaneous. </p>

<p class=Verses>“By the word of the LORD the heavens were made, And by the
breath of His mouth all their host.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 33:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“By faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the
word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things which are visible.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews
11:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For when they maintain this, it escapes their notice that by
the word of God the heavens existed long ago and the earth was formed out of
water and by water,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Peter 3:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The word for “God” in Genesis 1:1 is <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>אלהים</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>('ĕlôhı̂ym) and means that each member
of the Trinity had a role in creation and restoration. The Father planned the
universe. 1 Cor. 8:6. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom
are all things and we exist for Him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom are
all things, and we exist through Him.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 8:6, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Son created the universe. John 1:13; Col. 1:16;
Heb. 1:10. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh
nor of the will of man, but of God.&quot;  (John 1:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For by Him all things were created, both in the heavens
and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or
authorities—all things have been created through Him and for Him.&quot; 
(Colossians 1:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And, &quot;YOU, LORD, IN THE BEGINNING LAID THE
FOUNDATION OF THE EARTH, AND THE HEAVENS ARE THE WORKS OF YOUR HANDS;&quot; 
(Hebrews 1:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Holy Spirit restored the earth prior to the
creation of mankind. Gen. 1:2; Psalms 104:30.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The earth was formless and void, and darkness was over the
surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was moving over the surface of the
waters.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis 1:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“You send forth Your Spirit, they are created; And You renew
the face of the ground.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 104:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A perfect God can only create that which is perfect. In
Isaiah 45:18, the earth was “created” <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>בָּרָא</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>(bara) out of nothing by Jesus Christ to be inhabited by mankind,
angels, in addition to prehistoric air, land, and sea creatures as well as
plant life. Jesus Christ also “formed” the earth <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>יצר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(yâtsar). He established it to be inhabited. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For thus says the LORD, who created the heavens (He is the God
who formed the earth and made it, He established it and did not create it a
waste place, but formed it to be inhabited), “I am the LORD, and there is none
else.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah 45:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Man was not created in the original creation. Jer. 4:23-26.</p>

<p class=Verses>“I looked on the earth, and behold, it was formless and void;
And to the heavens, and they had no light. I looked on the mountains, and
behold, they were quaking, And all the hills moved to and fro. I looked, and
behold, there was no man, And all the birds of the heavens had fled. I looked,
and behold, the fruitful land was a wilderness, And all its cities were pulled
down Before the LORD, before His fierce anger.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Jeremiah 4:23-26,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>How old is the earth? It is as old as the heavens, the
stars, sun, moon which were all created at the same time. What is your attitude
toward original creation? Faith! You accept the Scriptural record. Heb. 1:3.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He is the radiance of His glory and the exact
representation of His nature, and upholds all things by the word of His power.
When He had made purification of sins, He sat down at the right hand of the
Majesty on high,&quot;  (Hebrews 1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Angelic Revolt Rendered a Perfect Earth Chaotic </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The time of the earth’s ruin is unknown. This ruin
rendered the earth uninhabitable and was due to the revolt of Satan. See
category on <a href="#_D-Angelic_Conflict,_Three">Angelic Conflict, Three Falls
of Satan and His Angels</a>. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Satan’s revolt caused some angels to choose for Satan and
revolt against God. These are called fallen angels or demons. The angels that
remained with God are called elect angels. Matt. 25:41; 1 Tim. 5:21; Mark
8:38.  </p>

<p class=Verses>““Then He will also say to those on His left, ‘Depart from Me,
accursed ones, into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and
his angels;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 25:41, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ
Jesus and of His chosen angels, to maintain these principles without bias,
doing nothing in a spirit of partiality.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Timothy 5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words in this adulterous
and sinful generation, the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when He comes
in the glory of His Father with the holy angels.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Mark 8:38, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Following the revolt of Satan, he and the fallen angels
that followed Satan in negative volition were cast down to the earth as part of
God's judgment for their revolt. On this single planet, a state of war existed.
This state of angelic war caused the earth to become uninhabitable. God's
further judgment then covered the surface of the earth with water and then
removed the source of light and heat, thus the earth became covered in ice and
darkness. The angelic revolt and God’s judgment caused the perfectly created
earth to become a ruin and uninhabitable. Isaiah 14:12-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;How you have fallen from heaven, O star of the morning,
son of the dawn! You have been cut down to the earth, You who have weakened the
nations! &quot;But you said in your heart, 'I will ascend to heaven; I will
raise my throne above the stars of God, And I will sit on the mount of assembly
In the recesses of the north. 'I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I
will make myself like the Most High.' &quot;Nevertheless you will be thrust
down to Sheol, To the recesses of the pit. &quot;Those who see you will gaze at
you, They will ponder over you, saying, 'Is this the man who made the earth
tremble, Who shook kingdoms, Who made the world like a wilderness And overthrew
its cities, Who did not allow his prisoners to go home?'” (Isaiah 14:12-17,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are operational demons that are well organized.
There are also those bound in Tartarus. Eph. 6:12; 2 Peter 2:4.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against
the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness,
against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians
6:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast
them into hell and committed them to pits of darkness, reserved for judgment;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2
Peter 2:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 1:2, “formless” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>תּהוּ</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(tôhû) and means devoid of value, ruined.
“Void” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>בּהוּ</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(bôhû) and means devoid
of life (no dinosaurs or plants). Became “Darkness” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>חשׁך</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(chôshek) and means emptiness, lifeless, devoid of
light, a darkness in which there is absolutely no light. Thus, as a result of
the angelic revolt and God’s judgment turned the earth into something formless,
void, a complete ruin, barren and nothing but darkness. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The earth was formless and void, and darkness was over
the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was moving over the surface of
the waters.&quot;  (Genesis 1:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 1:2, the surface of the earth was covered
completely by water. God sealed off the earth with water. Don’t confuse this
with the Great Flood of Noah’s day. Millions and millions of years ago, God
surrounded the earth with water, which then was turned to ice. Job 38:29-30. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;From whose womb has come the ice? And the frost of
heaven, who has given it birth? &quot;Water becomes hard like stone, And the
surface of the deep is imprisoned.&quot;  (Job 38:29-30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The earth continued in an undetermined state of chaos
after it was ruined. The earth could not  improve itself and never can. The fallen
angels could not improve it and never will. It takes the Holy Spirit to restore
the earth. Psalms 104:30.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;You send forth Your Spirit, they are created; And You
renew the face of the ground.&quot;  (Psalms 104:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Holy Spirit’s Restoration of the Earth </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The earth was not originally created in six literal
24-hour days or six periods of time. The entire universe including planet earth
was originally created by God the Son - Jesus Christ and He did it all
instantaneously by uttering a single word. The earth was originally created
perfect and beautiful. Satan and the angelic revolt ruined the earth and made
it into an uninhabitable and chaotic dump. The time of the restoration of the
earth by the Holy Spirit is unknown. Gen. 1:2; Psalms 104:30.</p>

<p class=Verses>“The earth was formless and void, and darkness was over the
surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was moving over the surface of the
waters.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Genesis 1:2, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“You send forth Your Spirit, they are created; And You renew
the face of the ground.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Psalms 104:30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 1:2, “the Spirit of God was moving” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>רָחַף</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(rachaph) and means to shake, to move. God
the Holy Spirit moved over the earth warming and melting the ice pack that had
surrounded the earth. This was the first step in the earth’s restoration. The
Holy Spirit restored the earth in six literal 24-hour days. God the Holy Spirit
restored the earth from existing chaotic materials, water, barrenness. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A principle of Hebrew syntax indicates that when the
Hebrew word for “day” <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>יום</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(yôm) is qualified
by either a cardinal (1,2,3) number or an ordinal number (1st, 2nd, 3rd), it
always refers to a literal 24-hour day without exception. Exodus 20:11.</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth,
the sea and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day; therefore the
LORD blessed the sabbath day and made it holy.” (Exodus 20:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This was the Holy Spirit’s restoration of the earth so it
could become habitable by mankind to resolve the Angelic Conflict. The Holy
Spirit’s work is to restore life. That is why the Holy Spirit is the agent of
regeneration.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Day 1 – Light and Darkness Separated</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 1:3, “God said” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>אלהים</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'><span dir=LTR></span> <span dir=RTL>אמר</span></span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>('ĕlôhı̂ym 'âmar)
is in the plural and refers to the Godhead, but <i>amar</i> is in the third
person masculine singular and means that only one member of the Trinity - God
the Father spoke these words. Although God the Holy Spirit was the primary
agent of restoration, the other two persons of the Trinity had a part. God the
Father spoke and God the Holy Spirit carried out the restoration work. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then God said, &quot;Let there be light&quot;; and there was
light.” (Genesis 1:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God the Holy Spirit created light, but not yet from any
illuminating or light-reflecting celestial bodies. This light would sustain
life on earth and prevent a complete refreezing as before the restoration
began. God then separated the light from darkness. Gen. 1:4. </p>

<p class=Verses>“God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light
from the darkness.” (Genesis 1:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Darkness still existed and will exist until the Jesus
Christ returns at His Second Advent and established the Millennial kingdom on
earth where He will be the source of all light extinguishing all darkness. Rev.
22:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And there will no longer be any night; and they will not have
need of the light of a lamp nor the light of the sun, because the Lord God will
illumine them; and they will reign forever and ever.” (Revelation 22:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 1:5, “there was evening and there was morning”
indicates that the earth had begun to rotate with respect to the source of the
light that was above the earth. This unusual light was not yet localized by God
into the sun, moon and stars.  “One day” refers to a literal 24-hour day of
earth’s rotation.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;God called the light day, and the darkness He called
night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day.&quot;  (Genesis
1:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Day 2 – The Atmosphere Formed</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>During Day 2, God formed the atmosphere to surround the
earth and made it separate from the surface waters. In Genesis 1:6-8, “expanse”
is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>רקיע</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(râqı̂ya‛) in the
Hebrew and means an extended surface or expanse. In Genesis 1:7, “made” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>עָשָׂה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
dir=LTR></span> (asah) and means to construct, to make it habitable, to restore
out of existing materials. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then God said, &quot;Let there be an expanse in the midst of
the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.&quot; God made the
expanse, and separated the waters which were below the expanse from the waters
which were above the expanse; and it was so. God called the expanse heaven. And
there was evening and there was morning, a second day.” (Genesis 1:6-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>At this point, the atmosphere existed between an upper
layer of water and the surface waters. God had formed the atmosphere such that
the combination of gases would support plant, animal and human life on earth.
This ended Day 2 of restoration.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Day 3 – Land Separated from Seas and Plant Life
Created</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>On Day 3, God caused the waters to be located within
certain permanent boundaries and caused dry land to appear in certain places. He
named the dry land “earth” and the waters “seas.” Gen. 1:9-10; Prov. 8:27-29.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then God said, &quot;Let the waters below the heavens be
gathered into one place, and let the dry land appear&quot;; and it was so. God
called the dry land earth, and the gathering of the waters He called seas; and
God saw that it was good.” (Genesis 1:9-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“&quot;When He established the heavens, I was there, When He
inscribed a circle on the face of the deep, When He made firm the skies above,
When the springs of the deep became fixed, When He set for the sea its boundary
So that the water would not transgress His command, When He marked out the
foundations of the earth;” (Proverbs 8:27-29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God then caused plant life to appear on the land that was
able to reproduce and was intended to support animal and human life. In Genesis
1:11-13, “after their kind” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>מין</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(mı̂yn) and means
after their own species. They did not “evolve” to get to this level of
perfection and complexity. God created them all instantaneously. This ended Day
3 of restoration.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then God said, &quot;Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants
yielding seed, and fruit trees on the earth bearing fruit after their kind with
seed in them&quot;; and it was so. The earth brought forth vegetation, plants
yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit with seed in them,
after their kind; and God saw that it was good. There was evening and there was
morning, a third day.” (Genesis 1:11-13, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Day 4 –Restoration of Light From Heavenly Bodies</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>On Day 4, God took the light He created on Day 1 and
localized its sources to be from celestial bodies as we know them today - the
sun, the moon, the stars and all of the other celestial bodies mankind has
observed. In Genesis 1:14, “light” is the Hebrew word <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>מאור</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span
dir=LTR></span> </span>(mâ'ôr) and means a luminous body or luminary. In
Genesis 1:3, the Hebrew word for the non-localized light was <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>אור</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>('ôr) and means illumination.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then God said, &quot;Let there be lights in the expanse of the
heavens to separate the day from the night, and let them be for signs and for
seasons and for days and years; and let them be for lights in the expanse of
the heavens to give light on the earth&quot;; and it was so.” (Genesis 1:14-15,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The universe was created in an instant by our Lord Jesus
Christ in Genesis 1:1. This creation included all that exists in the universe.
Genesis 1:14-15 refers to the restoration of light from these celestial bodies.
That means that their light from many light years distant was caused to be
visible on the earth.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 1:16-19, “made” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>עָשָׂה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(asah) and means to create out existing
materials. These existing materials were part of the original creation of the
universe of Genesis 1:1. God made the sun, moon, and stars and located where we
see them today. The “greater light” is the sun and the “lesser light” is the
moon. </p>

<p class=Verses>“God made the two great lights, the greater light to govern the
day, and the lesser light to govern the night; He made the stars also. God
placed them in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth, and to
govern the day and the night, and to separate the light from the darkness; and
God saw that it was good. There was evening and there was morning, a fourth
day.” (Genesis 1:16-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God set the precise locations and precise levels of
illumination of the sun, moon and stars from the earth such that life could
exist on planet earth. This ended Day 4 of restoration.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Day 5 – Aquatic Life and Birds Created</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>On Day 5, God created all aquatic life from the
single-celled organisms to the largest of sea creatures to fill the newly
confined seas. He also created the birds to fill the newly formed atmosphere. Gen.
1:20-21.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then God said, &quot;Let the waters teem with swarms of living
creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of the
heavens.&quot; God created the great sea monsters and every living creature
that moves, with which the waters swarmed after their kind, and every winged
bird after its kind; and God saw that it was good.” (Genesis 1:20-21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God then gave the aquatic life and the birds the ability
to reproduce within their own species just as He had done for the plant life. Gen.
1:22-23. This ended Day 5 of restoration.</p>

<p class=Verses>“God blessed them, saying, &quot;Be fruitful and multiply, and
fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.&quot; There
was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.” (Genesis 1:22-23, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Day 6 – Land Animals and Man Created</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>On Day 6, God created all land animals and gave each the
ability to reproduce within their own species just as He had for the aquatic
life, plant life and the birds.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then God said, &quot;Let the earth bring forth living
creatures after their kind: cattle and creeping things and beasts of the earth
after their kind&quot;; and it was so. God made the beasts of the earth after
their kind, and the cattle after their kind, and everything that creeps on the
ground after its kind; and God saw that it was good.” (Genesis 1:24-25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God then created man following the creation of the
perfect living environment on the earth. In Genesis 1:26, “created” is <span
lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>עָשָׂה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(asah) and means to create or form out of
existing materials. God created man’s soul in the shadow image of the essence
of God.  “Image” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>צלם</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(tselem) and means resemblance,
a representative figure, or image. “Likeness” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>דּמוּת</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(demûth) and means likeness, pattern,
resemblance. God created the soul of man in His image or as a pattern from
God’s essence. The image of God makes mankind unique among the other creatures
on earth. Man was created to rule over all other creatures on earth. </p>

<p class=Verses>“Then God said, &quot;Let Us make man in Our image, according
to Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds
of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth, and over every creeping
thing that creeps on the earth.&quot; God created man in His own image, in the
image of God He created him; male and female He created them.” (Genesis
1:26-27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Genesis 1:27, “created” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>בָּרָא</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(bara) and means to create out of nothing.
God created the soul of the man and woman in the image or likeness of His own
essence. God then created the bodies of man (from dust of the earth) and woman
(from the man’s rib) and “breathed” <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:
"SBL Hebrew"'>נשׁמה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span>
</span>(neshâmâh) into them physical life. They then became living beings.
Gen. 2:7; Gen. 2:22.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then the LORD God formed man of dust from the ground, and
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being.”
(Genesis 2:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The LORD God fashioned into a woman the rib which He had taken
from the man, and brought her to the man.” (Genesis 2:22, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Once created and alive, His instruction to them was to
reproduce just as He had instructed the other living creatures and plant life.
God also told them to subdue all of the living creatures and plant life on the
earth. Gen. 1:27. In Genesis 1:28, “subdue” is <span lang=HE dir=RTL
style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>כּבשׁ</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(kâbash) and means to subdue, to bring
into bondage, to bring into subjection, to conquer. “Rule” is <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>רָדָה</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(radah) and means to have dominion, to
rule, to dominate. God created mankind to dominate the earth and to rule over
all that lived upon it. Gen. 1:27-29.</p>

<p class=Verses>“God created man in His own image, in the image of God He
created him; male and female He created them. God blessed them; and God said to
them, &quot;Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and
rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over every
living thing that moves on the earth.&quot; Then God said, &quot;Behold, I have
given you every plant yielding seed that is on the surface of all the earth,
and every tree which has fruit yielding seed; it shall be food for you;”
(Genesis 1:27-29, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God had created plant life to be food for aquatic and
land animals. At this point, all animals,  aquatic life and mankind were
herbivorous. There were no carnivores present until after the fall of mankind
in the Garden. This ended Day 6 of restoration. God's work of restoration of
the earth was completed. Gen. 1:30-31; Gen. 2:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the sky
and to every thing that moves on the earth which has life, I have given every
green plant for food&quot;; and it was so. God saw all that He had made, and
behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the
sixth day.” (Genesis 1:30-31, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Thus the heavens and the earth were completed, and all their
hosts.” (Genesis 2:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Day 7 - Rest</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God had completed all creative and restorative work in
the first six literal 24-hour days. All powerful God “rested” not because he
was tired, but because His creative and restorative work was finished. “Rested”
is <span lang=HE dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שָׁבַת</span><span
dir=LTR></span><span lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(shabath) and means
to cease work, to rest from work. In Genesis 2:2-3, God set the precedent of
resting from work on the seventh day or Sabbath by sanctifying the seventh day as
a commemoration of God's grace provision. </p>

<p class=Verses>“By the seventh day God completed His work which He had done,
and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done. Then God
blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He rested from all His
work which God had created and made.” (Genesis 2:2-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Man could thus live on the earth and resolve the Angelic
Conflict. The Bible is not contrary to accurate scientific findings. The Bible
is contrary to human viewpoint findings and associated conclusions. Col. 2:14-15,
Hebrews 1 and 2.</p>

<p class=Verses>“having canceled out the certificate of debt consisting of
decrees against us, which was hostile to us; and He has taken it out of the
way, having nailed it to the cross. When He had disarmed the rulers and
authorities, He made a public display of them, having triumphed over them
through Him.” (Colossians 2:14-15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Biblical restoration is so constructed, along with the
flood, that rationalism and empiricism to the exclusion of faith can lead down
a blind alley. However, the Christian is not to be stupid. True biblical faith
has evidence that support the faith. Therefore, faith in Jesus Christ is the
issue first and then spiritual growth secondly. After that, an understanding of
original creation and restoration.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>God’s Future Destruction of the Existing Earth</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Future destruction of the restored earth and the current
universe is part of God's plan. 2 Peter 3:7.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But by His word the present heavens and earth are being
reserved for fire, kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly
men.&quot;  (2 Peter 3:7, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 2 Peter 3:8, the elapse of time does not hinder the
faithfulness of God! A promise made 1,000 years ago is still good today. God’s
faithfulness in provision of salvation is found in 2 Peter 3:9. Time is an
element in man’s promises, but not in the promises of God. </p>

<p class=Verses>“But do not let this one fact escape your notice, beloved, that
with the Lord one day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years like one
day.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Peter 3:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some count
slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing for any to perish but for all
to come to repentance.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Peter 3:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>God’s faithfulness in future judgment is found in 2 Peter
3:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, in which the
heavens will pass away with a roar and the elements will be destroyed with
intense heat, and the earth and its works will be burned up.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2
Peter 3:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The New Heavens and New Earth</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There will be a New Heavens and a New Earth created by
Jesus Christ at end of the Millennium. 2 Peter 3:13; Rev. 21:1; Rev. 21:5.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But according to His promise we are looking for new heavens
and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Peter 3:13,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven
and the first earth passed away, and there is no longer any sea.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation
21:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He who sits on the throne said, “Behold, I am making all
things new.” And He said, “Write, for these words are faithful and true.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Revelation
21:5, NASB)</p>
