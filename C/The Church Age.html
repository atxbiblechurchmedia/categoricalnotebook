<h2><a name="_D-The_Church_Age"></a><a name="_The_Church_Age"></a>The Church
Age</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Church Age began on the Day of Pentecost and will end
at the Rapture of the Church. It is composed of two periods of time – the
Pre-Canon Period and the Post-Canon Period. The Pre-Canon Period of the Church
Age was from 30 AD to 96 AD. It was the time of temporary spiritual gifts and
the time when the New Testament was being written. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Post-Canon Period of the Church Age is from 96 AD to
the Rapture of the Church. It is the era of permanent spiritual gifts and the
time when the completed written Canon of New Testament Scripture is available
and is being disseminated throughout the world. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The dispensation of the Church Age was inserted into the
Age of the Jews to form the Body of Christ that is made up of all Church Age
believers. The Body of Christ is being formed through the Baptism of the Spirit
whereby all believers are placed into union with Jesus Christ at salvation.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><img width=520 height=300 id="Picture 1"
src="The%20Church%20Age.png"></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Church Age brought a new modus operandi. The Church
Age is a very special age, a unique age, the age of mystery doctrine, an age of
great grace provision and assets not existing in Old Testament times. It provides
a supernatural grace means of the spiritual life. All of that has been provided
under the power and filling of the Holy Spirit enabling you to identify and
utilize your spiritual gift to the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Spiritual gifts came into operation in the Church Age. In
the Age of the Gentiles and the Age of the Jews, there were no spiritual gifts.
There were talents and abilities such as David being a king, a singer and
musician, a great military man and great leader. He used all of that for the
glory of God, but the only spiritual gift given and mentioned in Old Testament
times is the gift of prophecy. Some men had both the gift and the office, but
in the Church Age you have every Christian receiving a spiritual gift. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Covenant theologians think the Church is in the Old
Testament and is known as reformed theology. The Church is not in the Old
Testament. Never. The Church is confined to the Church Age which began at the
Day of Pentecost in 30 AD. It will terminate at the Rapture of the Church. 1
Thess. 4:13-17.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But we do not want you to be uninformed, brethren, about
those who are asleep, so that you will not grieve as do the rest who have no
hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring
with Him those who have fallen asleep in Jesus. For this we say to you by the
word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the
Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep. For the Lord Himself will
descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the
trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive
and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord
in the air, and so we shall always be with the Lord.&quot;  (1 Thessalonians
4:13-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Intercalation of the Church Age Dispensation</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are passages in the Old Testament where doctrine of
the Intercalation of the Church Age could have been mentioned, but were not.
Examples are Daniel 9:26-27 and Isaiah 61:1-2 between “year of the Lord” (First
Advent) and “day of vengeance” (Second Advent).</p>

<p class=Verses>““Then after the sixty-two weeks the Messiah will be cut off
and have nothing, and the people of the prince who is to come will destroy the
city and the sanctuary. And its end will come with a flood; even to the end
there will be war; desolations are determined. “And he will make a firm
covenant with the many for one week, but in the middle of the week he will put
a stop to sacrifice and grain offering; and on the wing of abominations will
come one who makes desolate, even until a complete destruction, one that is
decreed, is poured out on the one who makes desolate.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(Daniel
9:26-27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me, Because the LORD has
anointed me To bring good news to the afflicted; He has sent me to bind up the
brokenhearted, To proclaim liberty to captives And freedom to prisoners; To
proclaim the favorable year of the LORD And the day of vengeance of our God; To
comfort all who mourn,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah 61:1-2, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>No Distinctions Between Jew and Gentile in the Church
Age</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The dispensation of the Church or the Church Age is also
known as the “times of the Gentiles” in Luke 21:24. The Church Age is also the
emphasis of Ephesians 3:1-5 and Colossians 1:25-27. In Colossians 1:25-27,
“this church” refers to the Church Age and “past ages” is referring to the
previous dispensations - the Age of the Gentiles and the Age of the Jews.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and they will fall by the edge of the sword, and will be led
captive into all the nations; and Jerusalem will be trampled under foot by the
Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.” (Luke 21:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the
sake of you Gentiles— if indeed you have heard of the stewardship of God's
grace which was given to me for you; that by revelation there was made known to
me the mystery, as I wrote before in brief. By referring to this, when you read
you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ, which in other
generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed
to His holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit;” (Ephesians 3:1-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Of this church I was made a minister according to the
stewardship from God bestowed on me for your benefit, so that I might fully
carry out the preaching of the word of God, that is, the mystery which has been
hidden from the past ages and generations, but has now been manifested to His
saints, to whom God willed to make known what is the riches of the glory of
this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.”
(Colossians 1:25-27, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The dispensation of the Church Age is taught in the New
Testament epistles. Eph. 1:8-10.  </p>

<p class=Verses>“which He lavished on us. In all wisdom and insight He made
known to us the mystery of His will, according to His kind intention which He
purposed in Him with a view to an administration suitable to the fullness of
the times, that is, the summing up of all things in Christ, things in the
heavens and things on the earth. In Him” (Ephesians 1:8-10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The “mystery of His will” is the mystery Bible doctrines
that are now in writing in the New Testament and are the very thinking of Jesus
Christ. 1 Cor. 2:16. </p>

<p class=Verses>“For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, THAT HE WILL INSTRUCT
HIM? But we have the mind of Christ.” (1 Corinthians 2:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is the dispensation of the “fullness of the times”
because at the end of this dispensation, the entire Body of Christ will be
resurrected and will meet our Lord in the air at the Rapture of the Church. No
other dispensation has ever provided the grace resources now available to every
Church Age believer.  Eph. 3:2-3; Eph. 3:8-9.</p>

<p class=Verses>“if indeed you have heard of the stewardship of God's grace
which was given to me for you; that by revelation there was made known to me
the mystery, as I wrote before in brief.” (Ephesians 3:2-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“To me, the very least of all saints, this grace was given, to
preach to the Gentiles the unfathomable riches of Christ, and to bring to light
what is the administration of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God
who created all things;” (Ephesians 3:8-9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One of the results of the Baptism of the Holy Spirit is
the removal of all distinctions between the Jew and Gentile as all have become
one in Jesus Christ at salvation. In Galatians 3:26-28, “clothed yourselves
with Christ” means you were baptized by the Holy Spirit into union with Christ.
The result is removal of any distinction between Jew and Gentile. All
believers, regardless of race, sex, or social status have equal privilege and
opportunity to fulfill the plan of God for their lives.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. For
all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.
There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is
neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.” (Galatians
3:26-28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Unique Characteristics of the Church Age </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Church Age is called a mystery. Mystery is a body of
doctrine that was never revealed to the Old Testament writers. This would only
have confused the writers and hearers of the Old Testament. For every believer
in the Jewish Age to be a priest and to be indwelt by the Holy Spirit, to be
baptized by the Holy Spirit and filled with the Holy Spirit, to be in union
with Christ, would have been something. Moses longed to see such a day. Eph.
3:1-6; Col. 1:25-26; Rom. 16:25-26.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for
the sake of you Gentiles— if indeed you have heard of the stewardship of God's
grace which was given to me for you; that by revelation there was made known to
me the mystery, as I wrote before in brief. By referring to this, when you read
you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ, which in other
generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed
to His holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit; to be specific, that the
Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers
of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel,&quot;  (Ephesians 3:1-6,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Of this church I was made a minister according to the
stewardship from God bestowed on me for your benefit, so that I might fully
carry out the preaching of the word of God, that is, the mystery which has been
hidden from the past ages and generations, but has now been manifested to His
saints,&quot;  (Colossians 1:25-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now to Him who is able to establish you according to my
gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the
mystery which has been kept secret for long ages past, but now is manifested,
and by the Scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the
eternal God, has been made known to all the nations, leading to obedience of
faith;&quot;  (Romans 16:25-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The basis of unity in the Church Age is every believer’s
positional sanctification, positional truth, or union with Jesus Christ. In Old
Testament times, no one was in union with Christ. No one.  In the Church Age,
all believers are made new creatures in Christ. This is a permanent personal
relationship. 2 Cor. 5:17.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creature;
the old things passed away; behold, new things have come.&quot;  (2 Corinthians
5:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every believer is indwelt by the deity of Jesus Christ.
In Old Testament times, no one was indwelt by Christ. Not Moses, Abraham,
Elijah, or Jeremiah. The indwelling of Jesus Christ is the basis of fellowship,
but only when the believer is filled with the Holy Spirit. Rev. 3:20; John
14:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;'Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears
My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and will dine with him, and
he with Me.&quot;  (Revelation 3:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;In that day you will know that I am in My Father,
and you in Me, and I in you.&quot;  (John 14:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every believer is indwelt by God the Holy Spirit. Some
were empowered or endued in the Old Testament, but not indwelt by the Holy
Spirit. 1 Cor. 6:19-20.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy
Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and that you are not your own?
For you have been bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your
body.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 6:19-20, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Church Age brought a unique priesthood of every
believer. Because we are all priests we have a right to “Do homage to the Son.”
This means to worship Him. Giving is one of the sacrifices of the priesthood in
Hebrews 13. Worship also includes listening to Bible teaching, prayer, giving
as an expression of worship, observing the Lord’s Table, and praise. 1 Peter
2:5; 1 Peter 2:9; Psalms 2:12.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;you also, as living stones, are being built up as a
spiritual house for a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices
acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.&quot;  (1 Peter 2:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But you are A CHOSEN RACE, A royal PRIESTHOOD, A HOLY
NATION, A PEOPLE FOR God's OWN POSSESSION, so that you may proclaim the
excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous
light;&quot;  (1 Peter 2:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Do homage to the Son, that He not become angry, and you
perish in the way, For His wrath may soon be kindled. How blessed are all who
take refuge in Him!&quot;  (Psalms 2:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Every believer is an ambassador for Jesus Christ and acts
as our Lord’s representative while still living on earth. This doesn’t mean
that every believer is an elder, but is a full-time representative of Jesus
Christ. It makes your life full of meaning, purpose and definition. 2 Cor.
5:20; Eph. 6:20.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God
were making an appeal through us; we beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled
to God.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 5:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in
proclaiming it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.&quot;  (Ephesians 6:20,
NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We have our complete instructions in writing. The Canon
of Scripture is completed, therefore no instructions come through dreams,
through visions, through direct conversation with the Lord, or through a
classroom taught by an angel. 1 Cor. 13:10.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;but when the perfect comes, the partial will be done
away.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 13:10, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We have a supernatural way of life with a supernatural
means of execution, not a change of personality or a stereotyped personality. 2
Cor. 5:17; 2 Cor. 12:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creature;
the old things passed away; behold, new things have come.&quot;  (2 Corinthians
5:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And He has said to me, &quot;My grace is sufficient for
you, for power is perfected in weakness.&quot; Most gladly, therefore, I will
rather boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in
me.&quot;  (2 Corinthians 12:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The filling or controlling ministry of the Holy Spirit is
needed every time you get out of fellowship and is assured through the correct
use of 1 John 1:9 and Ephesians 5:18.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&quot;  (1 John
1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation,
but be filled with the Spirit,&quot;  (Ephesians 5:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Only once in all of human history has God created
equality and that is in the Church Age through the Baptism of the Holy Spirit.
Equality originates with the Baptism of the Holy Spirit when we are placed into
union with Christ. That is the only moment of equality. That’s why we have no
right to feel superior to anyone. Spiritual freedom means that immediately
after salvation, believers begin to develop at different rates due to their
volition. Some believers grow spiritually and some do not. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All Church Age believers are elected to equal privilege
because they have been placed into union with Jesus Christ and are thus members
of a royal priesthood. They are elected to equal opportunity through spiritual
freedom and provision of grace resources that provide all they will ever need
to grow spiritually. In eternity past, the foreknowledge of God knew that some
would exercise their free will to accept Jesus Christ as their Savior. This is called
Predestination. Having accepted the saving work of Jesus Christ for our sins,
we have equal privilege because we are in union with Christ and, therefore,
members of the royal family of God. See category on <a href="https://atxbiblechurchmedia.github.io/categoricalnotebook/P/Predestination.html">Predestination</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All Church Age believers have equal opportunity in their
spiritual lives when filled with the Holy Spirit to fulfill the plan of God for
their lives. All Church Age believers have exactly the same status in the royal
family of God.  We have our unique royal commissions as members of a royal
priesthood and are royal ambassadors for Jesus Christ. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All Church Age believers have availability to the unique
mystery Bible doctrines of the Church Age that comprise the New Testament of
the Bible. Every member of the Trinity indwells every believer. This is unique
in human history. We have the unique availability of divine power through the
filling of the Holy Spirit. Never before in history has divine omnipotence been
available for use to every believer.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This is the first dispensation where no prophecies are to
be fulfilled. However, there are two prophecies related to the start and end of
the Church Age. These are the Baptism of the Spirit that began the Church Age
and the Rapture of the Church that will end the Church Age.  </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Church Age is the dispensation whereby believers
positive to Bible doctrine can have an invisible impact due to blessing by
association. Believers as well as unbelievers can have some impact to their
city, state, and nation by adhering to the laws of divine establishment, but
only maturing believers can have the invisible impact because they are
advancing in the plan of God for their lives and thus are being blessed by God.
Those around such believers are blessed by God simply due to their association
with such believers.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Terms Related to the Church Age</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The “last Adam” in 1 Corinthians 15:45-47. A “new
creature” in 2 Corinthians 5:17. The “body” referring to the Body of Christ
composed of all Church Age believers in 1 Corinthians 12:12. The “head of the
body” in Colossians 1:18 referring to Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So also it is written, &quot;The first MAN, Adam, BECAME
A LIVING SOUL.&quot; The last Adam became a life-giving spirit. However, the
spiritual is not first, but the natural; then the spiritual. The first man is
from the earth, earthy; the second man is from heaven.&quot;  (1 Corinthians
15:45-47, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creature; the
old things passed away; behold, new things have come.” (2 Corinthians 5:17,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For even as the body is one and yet has many members, and
all the members of the body, though they are many, are one body, so also is
Christ.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 12:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“He is also head of the body, the church; and He is the
beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that He Himself will come to have
first place in everything.” (Colossians 1:18, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The “Shepherd” and the “sheep” in 1 Peter 5:4, Hebrews
13:20, John 10:26-27.  In John 10:16, “other sheep” refer to the Church Age.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the
unfading crown of glory.&quot;  (1 Peter 5:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Now the God of peace, who brought up from the dead the
great Shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the eternal covenant, even
Jesus our Lord,&quot;  (Hebrews 13:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;But you do not believe because you are not of My
sheep. &quot;My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow
Me;&quot;  (John 10:26-27, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;I have other sheep, which are not of this fold; I
must bring them also, and they will hear My voice; and they will become one
flock with one shepherd.&quot;  (John 10:16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The vine and the branches in John 15:4-5. You must
understand vines and how they are constructed.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot
bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you unless
you abide in Me. &quot;I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me
and I in him, he bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing.&quot; 
(John 15:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The chief cornerstone, and stones of the building.
Architectural terms. Eph. 2:20; 1 Peter 2:4-5.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;having been built on the foundation of the apostles and
prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the corner stone,&quot;  (Ephesians 2:20,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And coming to Him as to a living stone which has been
rejected by men, but is choice and precious in the sight of God, you also, as
living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house for a holy priesthood,
to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.&quot; 
(1 Peter 2:4-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The High Priest and Royal Priesthood which were confined
to two areas. 1 Peter 2; Heb. 7; Heb. 10.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The future analogy is the Bridegroom and the Bride. This
is after believers get their resurrection bodies at the Rapture of the Church.
Eph. 5:25-27. Fulfillment is found in Revelation 19:6-8.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the
church and gave Himself up for her, so that He might sanctify her, having
cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, that He might present to
Himself the church in all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle or any such
thing; but that she would be holy and blameless.&quot;  (Ephesians 5:25-27,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Then I heard something like the voice of a great
multitude and like the sound of many waters and like the sound of mighty peals
of thunder, saying, &quot;Hallelujah! For the Lord our God, the Almighty,
reigns. &quot;Let us rejoice and be glad and give the glory to Him, for the
marriage of the Lamb has come and His bride has made herself ready.&quot; It
was given to her to clothe herself in fine linen, bright and clean; for the
fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.&quot;  (Revelation 19:6-8,
NASB)</p>
