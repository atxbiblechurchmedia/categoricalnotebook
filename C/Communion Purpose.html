<h2>Communion Purpose</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>What is the purpose of the Lord’s Supper, the Eucharist,
Communion?  The purpose is harmony, remembrance, restoration, and fellowship.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Harmony </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>You should come together habitually for church service.
The love feast or church supper was eaten before Communion. Emphasis was not on
eating but on sharing - harmony as the Body of Christ. 1 Cor. 11:20-22; Heb.
10:25.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore when you meet together, it is not to eat the Lord’s
Supper, for in your eating each one takes his own supper first; and one is
hungry and another is drunk. What! Do you not have houses in which to eat and
drink? Or do you despise the church of God and shame those who have nothing?
What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? In this I will not praise you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Corinthians 11:20-22, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of
some, but encouraging one another; and all the more as you see the day drawing
near.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hebrews 10:25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Remembrance </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Believers are commanded to remember the death of the Lord
Jesus Christ. 1 Cor. 11:24-25.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, “This is
My body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of Me.” In the same way He
took the cup also after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in My
blood; do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Corinthians 11:24-25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Remembrance connotes thinking, thinking of the death of
Jesus Christ in this case. Bona fide remembrance demands Bible doctrine
regarding Jesus Christ and His work on the Cross resident in the right lobe of
the soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Knowledge of such doctrine in the soul’s frame of
reference results in occupation with Christ, the maturing of the individual
resulting in an edification complex of the soul. The more Bible doctrine one
assimilates, the more the “fragrance of memories” comes into focus as far as
our Lord’s person and work is concerned.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Throughout eternity the Lord Jesus Christ will carry His
scars from the Cross. We will never forget what the Savior did in dying spiritually
for our sins. Also the doctrine of remembrance or fragrance of memories is a
very powerful doctrine, very effective, and very necessary in the life of the
mature believer.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The bread speaks of the Work of Christ with emphasis on
the person of Christ in His incarnation. He was impeccable. 2 Cor. 5:21; John
6:35. </p>

<p class=Verses>“He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that
we might become the righteousness of God in Him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Corinthians
5:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Jesus said to them, “I am the bread of life; he who comes to
Me will not hunger, and he who believes in Me will never thirst.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John
6:35, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In 1 Corinthians 11:24, the phrase “which is for you”
speaks of the physical suffering Jesus Christ endured before and while on the Cross.
Eating of the bread is a picture of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=Verses>“and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, “This is
My body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of Me.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Corinthians 11:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Not one of His bones were broken. This fulfilled Old
testament Scripture. John 19:33; John 19:36; Exodus 12:46, Num. 9:12. </p>

<p class=Verses>“but coming to Jesus, when they saw that He was already dead,
they did not break His legs.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 19:33, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For these things came to pass to fulfill the Scripture, “NOT A
BONE OF HIM SHALL BE BROKEN.”“&nbsp;&nbsp;(John 19:36, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>““It is to be eaten in a single house; you are not to bring
forth any of the flesh outside of the house, nor are you to break any bone of
it.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Exodus 12:46, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“‘They shall leave none of it until morning, nor break a bone
of it; according to all the statute of the Passover they shall observe it.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Numbers
9:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The cup speaks of the work of Christ with emphasis on His
substitutionary spiritual death on the Cross for all of mankind’s sins – the Blood
of Christ. Our salvation is a new covenant through the death of Jesus Christ.
We are to keep on doing this in remembrance of Him. Isaiah 53:5; 1 Cor.
11:23-26.</p>

<p class=Verses>“But He was pierced through for our transgressions, He was
crushed for our iniquities; The chastening for our well-being fell upon Him,
And by His scourging we are healed.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Isaiah 53:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to
you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which He was betrayed took bread; and
when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, “This is My body, which is for
you; do this in remembrance of Me.” In the same way He took the cup also after
supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in My blood; do this, as often as
you drink it, in remembrance of Me.” For as often as you eat this bread and
drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until He comes.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Corinthians 11:23-26, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Restoration </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>We are not to partake of communion while out of
fellowship. We are to examine our spiritual status to confirm we are in
fellowship. To be sure, we are to use 1 John 1:9 and cite all known sins to God
the Father. In doing so, we are assured of the filling of the Holy Spirit and
fellowship with Jesus Christ. 1 Cor. 11:27-32.</p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
John 1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Therefore whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord
in an unworthy manner, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.
But a man must examine himself, and in so doing he is to eat of the bread and
drink of the cup. For he who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgment to
himself if he does not judge the body rightly. For this reason many among you
are weak and sick, and a number sleep. But if we judged ourselves rightly, we
would not be judged. But when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord so
that we will not be condemned along with the world.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Corinthians
11:27-32, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>One should never partake of communion as a believer while
out of fellowship. Thus, the believer is to examine himself and then partake of
the bread and cup after confession of sin. To partake of communion out of
fellowship puts the believer under severe divine discipline and potentially the
Sin Unto Death. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If you partake of communion while out of fellowship, you
are subject to serious divine discipline. Because believers take communion
while out of fellowship, many are “weak” (feeble, loss of energy)  and are
“sickly” (chronic invalids) and “many sleep” (Christian death). If we judge
ourselves and confess our known sins to God the Father, we avoid divine
discipline.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>No church board or church government is to bar a believer
from communion. It is a personal and individual matter. There is no biblical
basis for a closed communion.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Fellowship </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All believers are mandated by our Lord to be in
fellowship before partaking of communion. When you come together for the
Communion Table, wait for all and partake together. 1 Cor. 11:33-34.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So then, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for
one another. If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, so that you will not
come together for judgment. The remaining matters I will arrange when I come.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
Corinthians 11:33-34, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>While the Passover Feast of the Old Testament looked
forward, the Eucharist of the New Testament looks back to the Cross. Both were
commanded in their respective ages. The command for the Eucharist is found in
Matthew 26:26-28.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;While they were eating, Jesus took some bread, and after
a blessing, He broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, &quot;Take,
eat; this is My body.&quot; And when He had taken a cup and given thanks, He
gave it to them, saying, &quot;Drink from it, all of you; for this is My blood
of the covenant, which is poured out for many for forgiveness of sins.&quot; 
(Matthew 26:26-28, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Whereas water baptism illustrates our relationship with
Christ, communion illustrates our fellowship with Christ. Communion means
fellowship. 1 Cor. 10:16-22.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Is not the cup of blessing which we bless a sharing in
the blood of Christ? Is not the bread which we break a sharing in the body of
Christ? Since there is one bread, we who are many are one body; for we all
partake of the one bread.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 10:16-17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of
demons; you cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of
demons.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 10:21, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The bread element emphasizes the human body of Christ and
the fruit of the vine element emphasizes the work of Christ on the Cross. The
substitutionary spiritual death of Jesus Christ on the Cross is also called the
Blood of Christ. 1 Cor. 11:24-26.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said,
&quot;This is My body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of Me.&quot; In
the same way He took the cup also after supper, saying, &quot;This cup is the
new covenant in My blood; do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of
Me.&quot; For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim
the Lord's death until He comes.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 11:24-26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Unity in a local church is based on Bible doctrine taken
in through the grace apparatus for perception, not love. 1 Cor. 11:33-34.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;So then, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait
for one another. If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, so that you will not
come together for judgment. The remaining matters I will arrange when I
come.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 11:33-34, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>From the standpoint of the believer eating the bread (the
Bread of Life) is a picture of faith in the person of Jesus Christ, and
drinking of the wine or juice is a picture of faith in the work of Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Malachi 1:7-8, polluted bread represented an actual
attack on the person and work of Christ. They in type, polluted the person of
Christ (made Him a sinner) and therefore corrupted the work of Christ (made His
work that of a sinner, sick, lame, blind). Therefore one is never to tamper
with the person and work of Christ.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;You are presenting defiled food upon My altar. But
you say, 'How have we defiled You?' In that you say, 'The table of the LORD is
to be despised.' &quot;But when you present the blind for sacrifice, is it not
evil? And when you present the lame and sick, is it not evil? Why not offer it
to your governor? Would he be pleased with you? Or would he receive you
kindly?&quot; says the LORD of hosts.&quot;  (Malachi 1:7-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>How often should communion be served? This is a hot issue
in many local churches. In 1 Corinthians 11:24-2, “do this in remembrance of Me”
is present linear Aktionsart in the Greek which would make quarterly not often
enough and probably once a month being about right. The early church had
communion once a week, but then they also met daily. The Passover of the Age of
Israel gave way to communion in the Church Age. How often did they have the
Passover in the Old Testament? Once a year.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said,
&quot;This is My body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of Me.&quot; In
the same way He took the cup also after supper, saying, &quot;This cup is the
new covenant in My blood; do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of
Me.&quot;&quot;  (1 Corinthians 11:24-25, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Communion is based on the “fragrance of memories.” In 1
Corinthians 11:26 , our Lord commanded Church Age believers to participate in
the ritual of communion until He returns at the Rapture of the Church. This
doctrine of fragrance of memories kept the Shulammite Woman true to her Shepherd
Lover in Song of Solomon. The believer is never to forget the memory of the
Cross and what our Lord did for all of us.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you
proclaim the Lord's death until He comes.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 11:26, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Any believer has the right to partake of communion.
However, only those in fellowship should partake as they are filled with the
Holy Spirit and realize its true significance. If they remain out of
fellowship, they must understand the divine discipline consequences and be
taught the proper biblical use of 1 John 1:9 and 1 Cor. 11:31-32.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&quot;  (1 John
1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But if we judged ourselves rightly, we would not be
judged. But when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord so that we will
not be condemned along with the world.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 11:31-32, NASB)</p>
