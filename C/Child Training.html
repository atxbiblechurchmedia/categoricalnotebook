<h2>Child Training</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Parental Discipline for the Young</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The 0-12 years are informational years. The 13-19 years
are applicational years. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The 0-12 years are divided into two stages: the pre-age
of accountability and post-age of accountability. Matt. 18:2-5; 2 Tim. 3:15;1
John 2:12-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“And He called a child to Himself and set him before them, and
said, “Truly I say to you, unless you are converted and become like children,
you will not enter the kingdom of heaven. “Whoever then humbles himself as this
child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. “And whoever receives one
such child in My name receives Me;”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Matthew 18:2-5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“I am writing to you, little children, because your sins have
been forgiven you for His name’s sake. I “and that from childhood you have
known the sacred writings which are able to give you the wisdom that leads to
salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Timothy 3:15,
NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>am writing to you, fathers, because you know Him who has been
from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome
the evil one. I have written to you, children, because you know the Father. I
have written to you, fathers, because you know Him who has been from the
beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the
word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
John 2:12-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>If training is lacking in these years, the harsh rod of
Proverbs 23:13-16 will be needed in the teenage years.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Do not hold back discipline from the child, Although you
strike him with the rod, he will not die. You shall strike him with the rod And
rescue his soul from Sheol. My son, if your heart is wise, My own heart also
will be glad; And my inmost being will rejoice When your lips speak what is
right.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 23:13-16, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Nothing can replace parental maturity, stability and
consistency. 2 Tim. 1:5; 2 Tim. 1:13-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“For I am mindful of the sincere faith within you, which first
dwelt in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am sure that it is
in you as well.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Timothy 1:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Retain the standard of sound words which you have heard from
me, in the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus. Guard, through the Holy
Spirit who dwells in us, the treasure which has been entrusted to you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2
Timothy 1:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>When a husband is lacking, God often supplies the wisdom
of a noninterfering grandmother. Timothy was raised without the benefit of a
father’s instruction, however the doctrinal rod took up the slack. As a general
principle, spanking with the hand is applicable up through the babe stage, with
the rod from teenage stage on.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For children before they reach puberty, the father should
discipline the sons and daughters. The mother should discipline the sons and
the daughters in the father’s absence. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Discipline in the child 0-12 years old involves visual,
verbal, touching, confining, and limitations. Visual discipline may be the
disapproving look or facial expression. Verbal discipline involves verbal
chastisement and warnings of more intense discipline. Touching discipline can
involve a slap of the hands or bottom, but never the face. Confining discipline
may involve making them sit or stand in one place for a time. Limitation
discipline may involve restrictions of certain activities that the child likes.
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The parent should tailor the punishment to the child’s
personality and to the seriousness of the infraction. Emphasize what they did
wrong and emphasize that they take responsibility for their actions, not allowing
them to just say, “I’m sorry.” Letting them off this way will teach them that
faking regret is all that is needed to avoid discipline. You don’t want an
emotional reaction.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Rearing the child is based on volitional responses. You need
to keep them on positive signals. 1 Peter 2:2-3.</p>

<p class=Verses>“like newborn babies, long for the pure milk of the word, so
that by it you may grow in respect to salvation, if you have tasted the
kindness of the Lord.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Peter 2:2-3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The preparation of a child is to give him a solid
structure to guard against the sins that result in buildup to scar tissue in
the soul such as mental attitude sins and overt sins such as adultery, drunkenness,
and drugs. Rearing children should be no big deal for spiritually mature
parents. Prov. 20:20; Prov. 20:29; Prov. 20:1.</p>

<p class=Verses>“He who curses his father or his mother, His lamp will go out
in time of darkness.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 20:20, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“The glory of young men is their strength, And the honor of old
men is their gray hair.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 20:29, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Wine is a mocker, strong drink a brawler, And whoever is
intoxicated by it is not wise.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proverbs 20:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Child Raising in Marriage</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the spiritual life, the grace of God does all the work.
Man receives that gracious work and God gets the glory and credit. God makes it
possible for a believer to be become more like His Son through salvation belief
in the work of Jesus Christ on the Cross, growing in grace and knowledge of
Jesus Christ via the filling of the Holy Spirit and the grace apparatus for
perception. This is all God’s grace. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The believer’s greatest occupational hazard is not using
the grace of God. When the grace of God is spurned, scar tissue builds up in
the soul from false teaching. Without Bible doctrine in the soul, a vacuum pulls
in false teaching called the “futility of their mind” in Ephesians 4:17. This
is negative volition toward Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=Verses>“So this I say, and affirm together with the Lord, that you
walk no longer just as the Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their mind,”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians
4:17, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The greatest virtue in the Christian life is knowledge of
Bible doctrine. The greatest tragedy in the Christian life is ignorance of
Bible doctrine. Into this vacuum is poured false doctrine, religion, human good
systems, mental attitude sins with self-induced misery, and the emphasis on the
details of life. This results in doctrinal blackout as described in Ephesians
4:18-19 as “being darkened in their understanding” toward God, their spouse, friends,
details of life, and parents.</p>

<p class=Verses>“being darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life
of God because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of
their heart; and they, having become callous, have given themselves over to
sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ephesians
4:18-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>“Having become callous” is scar tissue in the soul. Ignorance
of Bible doctrine alienates from the life of God. Such alienation leads to
friction in the soul from thought patterns of mental attitude sins and overt
behavior pattern. These conflicts or friction in the soul produce scar tissue
in the soul. Scar tissue destroys capacity for love and destroys inner
happiness. Scar tissue alienates the believer from the Christian life in that
it destroys true love for others in all categories - God, spouse, friends,
details, and parents. Scar tissue can only be removed by reversing the process
that created it. 2 Tim. 1:13-14.</p>

<p class=Verses>“Retain the standard of sound words which you have heard from
me, in the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus. Guard, through the Holy
Spirit who dwells in us, the treasure which has been entrusted to you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(2
Timothy 1:13-14, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Learning Bible doctrine and keeping in the Word will
gradually buildup <i>epignosis</i> Bible doctrine in the right lobe of the
soul. This replaces the scar tissue. “Faith and love” refers to using faith-rest
by claiming the promises of God and staying in fellowship by consistent
confession of known sins to God the Father via 1 John 1:9. </p>

<p class=Verses>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”&nbsp;&nbsp;(1
John 1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Corporeal Punishment</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Use of the word “rod” in Proverbs 13:24 is <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>שׁבט</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(shêbeṭ) and means a stick, a branch.
Prov. 10:13; Prov. 10:1; Prov. 13:1; Prov. 14:9; Prov. 15:10; Prov. 15:20;
Prov. 17:6; Prov. 20:20; Prov. 20:27; Prov. 20:30; Prov. 30:11-17. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He who withholds his rod hates his son, But he who loves
him disciplines him diligently.&quot;  (Proverbs 13:24, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;On the lips of the discerning, wisdom is found, But a rod
is for the back of him who lacks understanding.&quot;  (Proverbs 10:13, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son makes a father glad,
But a foolish son is a grief to his mother.&quot;  (Proverbs 10:1, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In Proverbs 14:3, a different Hebrew word <span lang=HE
dir=RTL style='font-family:"SBL Hebrew"'>חטר</span><span dir=LTR></span><span
lang=HE><span dir=LTR></span> </span>(chôṭêr) is used for “rod” and means
rod, twig. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;In the mouth of the foolish is a rod for his back, But
the lips of the wise will protect them.&quot;  (Proverbs 14:3, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Proverbs 22:8 indicates the use of the rod in the wrong
way. There is a right way and a wrong way to use the rod.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He who sows iniquity will reap vanity, And the rod of his
fury will perish.&quot;  (Proverbs 22:8, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Proverbs 22:15 shows that the father has a
responsibility!</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child; The rod
of discipline will remove it far from him.&quot;  (Proverbs 22:15, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Proverbs 23:13-14 and Proverbs 29:15 indicate the value
of corporeal punishment.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Do not hold back discipline from the child, Although you
strike him with the rod, he will not die. You shall strike him with the rod And
rescue his soul from Sheol.&quot;  (Proverbs 23:13-14, NASB) </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The rod and reproof give wisdom, But a child who gets his
own way brings shame to his mother.&quot;  (Proverbs 29:15, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Proverbs 26:3 shows the principle of guidance in
corporeal punishment.  </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;A whip is for the horse, a bridle for the donkey, And a
rod for the back of fools.&quot;  (Proverbs 26:3, NASB) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Training the Teenager</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Proverbs deals exclusively with the Christian life and is
written for people with a short concentration span. Who is that? Teenagers!
Proverbs is written in two line poetry called distiches. This is David teaching
his teenage son Solomon and also Solomon teaching Rehoboam.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are four main themes in Proverbs: The stress of
making the intake and application of Bible doctrine your number one priority,
the three categories of sins, the details of life, and divine good versus human
good.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is stress when the believer makes Bible doctrine
the number one priority in their life. Wisdom is application of Bible doctrine
to experience. Knowledge is the facts of the Word. A fool in Proverbs is the
believer with no Bible doctrine - a vacuum in their soul. Prov. 4:1-8.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Hear, O sons, the instruction of a father, And give
attention that you may gain understanding, For I give you sound teaching; Do
not abandon my instruction. When I was a son to my father, Tender and the only
son in the sight of my mother, Then he taught me and said to me, &quot;Let your
heart hold fast my words; Keep my commandments and live; Acquire wisdom!
Acquire understanding! Do not forget nor turn away from the words of my mouth.
&quot;Do not forsake her, and she will guard you; Love her, and she will watch
over you. &quot;The beginning of wisdom is: Acquire wisdom; And with all your
acquiring, get understanding. &quot;Prize her, and she will exalt you; She will
honor you if you embrace her.&quot;  (Proverbs 4:1-8, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Proverbs deals with the three categories of sins: mental
attitude sins, sins of the tongue, and overt acts of sin. Prov. 6:16-19.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;There are six things which the LORD hates, Yes, seven
which are an abomination to Him: Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, And hands that
shed innocent blood, A heart that devises wicked plans, Feet that run rapidly
to evil, A false witness who utters lies, And one who spreads strife among
brothers.&quot;  (Proverbs 6:16-19, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Proverbs deals with the details of life such as money,
friends, social life, jobs, pleasure, sex, health, and liquor. Prov. 8:19; Prov.
2:12; Prov. 17:17; Prov. 26:15-26; Prov. 21:17; Prov. 6:32; Prov. 3:8; Prov.
23:29-30.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;My fruit is better than gold, even pure gold, And
my yield better than choicest silver.&quot;  (Proverbs 8:19, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;To deliver you from the way of evil, From the man who
speaks perverse things;&quot;  (Proverbs 2:12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;A friend loves at all times, And a brother is born for
adversity.&quot;  (Proverbs 17:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;He who loves pleasure will become a poor man; He who
loves wine and oil will not become rich.&quot;  (Proverbs 21:17, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;The one who commits adultery with a woman is lacking
sense; He who would destroy himself does it.&quot;  (Proverbs 6:32, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;It will be healing to your body And refreshment to your
bones.&quot;  (Proverbs 3:8, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has contentions? Who has
complaining? Who has wounds without cause? Who has redness of eyes? Those who
linger long over wine, Those who go to taste mixed wine.&quot;  (Proverbs
23:29-30, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The teenage child should be taught the doctrine of
authority orientation toward parents, their teachers, their coaches, toward
policeman, the military, toward their pastor, toward the Word, and toward God.
The teenage child should be taught the doctrine of privacy of others, the
rights of others, the property of others, the freedom of others, and the need
for respect of others.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Your son and your daughter should understand the four
generation curse. The teenager should know this doctrine and that they should
always obey their parents and honor them. Exodus 20:5; Prov. 30:11-17; Matt.
15:4; Deut. 21:18-23; Eph. 6:1-4.  See category on the <a
href="#_Four_Generation_Curse">Four Generation Curse</a>. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;You shall not worship them or serve them; for I,
the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on
the children, on the third and the fourth generations of those who hate
Me,&quot;  (Exodus 20:5, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;For God said, 'HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER,' and,
'HE WHO SPEAKS EVIL OF FATHER OR MOTHER IS TO BE PUT TO DEATH.'&quot;  (Matthew
15:4, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>“Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.
HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER (which is the first commandment with a promise),
SO THAT IT MAY BE WELL WITH YOU, AND THAT YOU MAY LIVE LONG ON THE EARTH.
Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the
discipline and instruction of the Lord.” (Ephesians 6:1-4, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Home Training for Children</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The father teaching his children</u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>A son, for example, may have a woman Sunday School
teacher, elementary teacher, or high school teacher. He sees little of his
father and his mother does most of the raising at home. Mother and father must
have one mind in teaching their children Bible doctrine.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Teaching Content </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For preschool ages, teach the essence of God and the
Trinity. In kindergarten and first grade, teach salvation and prayer.  For
second and third grade, teach assurance and confession of sin biblically.
Isaiah 28:10-11; 1 John 5:11-12; 1 John 1:9.</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;&quot;For He says, 'Order on order, order on order, Line
on line, line on line, A little here, a little there.'&quot; Indeed, He will
speak to this people Through stammering lips and a foreign tongue,&quot; 
(Isaiah 28:10-11, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;And the testimony is this, that God has given us eternal
life, and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has the life; he who does
not have the Son of God does not have the life.&quot;  (1 John 5:11-12, NASB)</p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&quot;  (1 John
1:9, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Teach and then review what you have taught and then teach
a little more. Regarding sin, list them - mental attitude sins, verbal sins,
overt sins. Teach the filling of the Holy Spirit, divine discipline, privacy of
personal property, respect for parent’s privacy, and not barging into a bedroom
without knocking and asking permission to enter first. Teach volition and
prayer where you address God the Father in Jesus’ name and in the power of the
Holy Spirit. Teach them to confess sin, if necessary and have mental attitude
thanksgiving. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For fourth grade, teach dispensations using Isaac, Jacob,
and Joseph, teach the Faith-rest life, divine guidance, occupation with Christ,
and living in the Word.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>For fifth and sixth grades, teach Joshua that emphasizes
divine viewpoint vs. human viewpoint. Study the name of Christ in Scripture,
the seven baptisms, the seven deaths, the six trials of Jesus, and volition.</p>
