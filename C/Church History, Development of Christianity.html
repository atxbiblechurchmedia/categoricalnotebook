<h2><a name="_Church_History,_Development"></a>Church History, Development of
Christianity and Church History up through 305 AD</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Founding of the Jerusalem church: 30-44 AD</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Pentecost: Peter’s sermon, Holy Spirit given to all
believers and, thereafter, at the moment of salvation, 3,000 saved.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Progress: Growth was rapid. Multitudes were saved daily.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Persecution: First, by the Sanhedrin. Peter and John were
examples of victims. Secondly, political persecution. Herod killed James.
Martyrs: Stephen. This caused the spread and growth of the Gospel. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Program and Policy. Charity was handled by the deacons.
Sermons centered around the crucified, resurrected Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Church in Palestine:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Philip takes the Gospel to Samaria. Acts 8</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Peter preaches to the Jews, then in Cornelius’ house,
then to the Gentiles.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Gentile church then originates at Antioch. Paul
preaches to the Gentiles.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The leadership in the early church: Apostle Paul</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul’s environment: He was trained under Gamaliel. He was
a free born Roman citizen. He was a citizen of Tarsus. He operated under a
specific political environment. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Caesar Augustus, Octavius, Julius Caesar’s nephew: 2737
AD. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Caligula: insane during part of his reign: 37-41 AD.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Claudius: excellent administrator during Paul’s three
missionary journeys: 41-54 AD.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Nero: insane most of the time. Paul was martyred under
his reign: 54-68 AD. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul’s social environment: There was the aristocratic
group who was indifferent. They were philosophically oriented to salvation.
There was the poor class. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul’s work as a propagator of the gospel: Expansion to
the West. Located in strategic centers. Began in Jewish synagogues. After
preaching to the Jews would go to the Gentiles. Would organize a church,
appoint leadership, then move on. Depended on the Holy Spirit for guidance.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul’s publications contained: Human and spiritual
wisdom. Morality in pagan environments. Cited lawsuits between Christians
before pagan judges. Information on marriage problems. Information which dealt
with social intercourse with pagan idolaters. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul’s theology: It grew out of the teachings of Christ
and was received by direct revelation from God. The Cross of Christ was the
starting point for spiritual life not the Law. Ethical system based on personal
union with Christ by faith. Rejected the evolutionary progress of history. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul as a polemicist: Fought for purity of Christian
doctrine. Denounced doggedly Judaism as to its principles. Fought Gnosticism as
the first heresy of the church. Gnosticism was salvation by ascetic acts to deny
the desires of the material and evil body.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Early books and parchments in church history: 95 - 150
AD </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Writing of the church fathers: 95-150 AD </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i><u>Epistolary literatures: </u></i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Clement of Rome: Wrote to the Corinthians. Admonished
Christians to end revolt against the elders and end their disturbances. Exalted
the position of the bishop in the Church. Equivalent to the pastor-teacher.
Obedience to the bishop was a must and guarantee of Christian unity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ignatius: Bishop of Antioch. Warns against Gnostics and
Docetics (Christ was pure spirit). Insists on revelation of Christ in the
flesh. Major contribution was the establishing of the monarchal bishop.
Hierarchy of church authority was established - bishop, elder, deacon works and
steadfastness.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Epistle of Barnabas: written by an Alexandrian believer.
130 AD. Christ completely adequate for salvation. Christians are not bound to
observe the Law. Contrast of the two ways of life. Went beyond typology to
allegory to make Scripture say what he wanted it to say. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Epistle to Diognetus: anonymous. Was a rational defense
of Christianity. Emphasized the inadequacy of Judaism. Emphasized the
superiority of Christianity in its beliefs, the character it builds and
benefits it offers its converts. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Second Epistle of Clement to Corinthians: Was not
written by Clement of Rome. Was written about 150 AD. Presents sound view of
Christ, resurrection of the body and the purity of life of the Christian.
Emphasizes that the Christian is to enter conflict against the world by
practicing Christian virtues and working out salvation begun in Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Papias: Bishop of Hierapolis, life and words of Christ. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i><u>Apocalyptic literature: </u></i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Shepherd of Hermas. 150 AD. Emphasizes need of
repentance by the use of symbols. Aim is moral and practical. Uses visions and
allegory. The relationship of the individual to Christian society and the
church. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i><u>Catechistical literature: </u></i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Didache discovered in 1873-75. It was a manual of
church instruction. It emphasized ethical actions. It emphasized liturgical
problems. It emphasized how to distinguish false prophets. It emphasized a
watchful and consistent life.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The government of the church with bishops and deacons:
</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The government of the church, local, had its origin in
Christ. He chose 12 Apostles. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Qualifications of the officials of the church: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Inward call by the Holy Spirit. This would be the
spiritual gift seeking expression. External call by democratic vote of the
church. This would be congregational recognition of the spiritual gift.
Ordaining to office by the apostles. This would be public recognition of the
spiritual gift. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There were two groups of officials: The charismatic
officials: apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastor-teachers who were chosen by
Christ and endowed with the spiritual gift. The administrative officials who
were chosen by the congregation after prayer and functioned in the
administrative sphere.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Observation: There was a weakness in their understanding
from the beginning and extra emphasis on the pastor-teacher gift. Lesser
emphasis was put on the other gifts. This will later give rise to a development
of the bishopric hierarchy.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The administrative officials were divided into two groups
also with each having distinguishing responsibilities. The elder was
responsible for public worship, good government, and church discipline. Deacons
were responsible for dispensing of charity and administering communion. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The development of the episcopate: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Three men largely were responsible for information on the
development of the episcopacy: Ignatius in Syria: 107-115 AD, Ireneus in Gaul:
202 AD, and  Cyprian in North Africa: 258 AD.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i><u>The information of Ignatius concerning the bishop: </u></i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The bishop was the head and center of a single
congregation. He was not equally representative to the whole Church. He is a
vicar of Christ and not merely a successor of the apostles. The presbyters and
deacons were the successors of the apostles, therefore, the bishop is above the
presbyters and deacons. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There is no distinction of order among bishops. They are
of equal status among themselves with no trace of primacy and all fully
coordinate. Therefore, this is congregation centered, not diocesan. This would
be a growing new institution, not a policy of apostolic origin. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i><u>The information of Ireneus as to the bishop and
episcopacy: </u></i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He presents the bishopric as a diocesan office. He
presents it as a continuation of the apostolate. He presents it as the vehicle
of the catholic tradition. He exalts the bishops of the original apostolic
churches. He exalts even greater the church of Rome. He speaks emphatically of
the unbroken episcopal succession. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i><u>The information of Cyprian as to the bishop and
episcopacy: </u></i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>He relates the bishop and episcopacy with a special
priesthood and sacrifice. He considered the bishop as the bearer of the Holy
Spirit, passed from Christ to the apostles, then on down to him giving efficacy
to all religious exercises. “The bishop is in the church and the church in the
bishop and if anyone is not with the bishop he is not in the church.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>All bishops are expressing one office in their function
and each is representing in himself the whole office. The bishop did not
undertake any important matter without the advice of the presbyters or deacons.
The ordination of bishops was performed by the neighboring bishops, requiring
at least three in number. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The pseudo-Clementine episcopacy: Ebionitic sect version.
Presents the bishop as the vicar of Christ. Bishop is the successor of the
apostles. Held to the primacy or a universal church monarchy, in Peter and the
Roman See. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i><u>The development of the rank system of the bishops:
300-400 (fourth Century). </u></i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The lowest level of bishop, the country church bishop
χαρεπισ. They stood between the presbyters, deacons and the city bishops.
Aren’t mentioned until the fourth century but probably existed earlier. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Second level of bishop: the primacy of the bishop of a
capital city over the rest of the city bishops. They ordained the bishops of
the provinces. They presided over the provincial synods, primi inter pares
(Latin for first among equals). </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Third level of bishop: the primacy of the bishop of the
apostolic mother churches, Jerusalem, Antioch, Alexandria, Ephesus, Corinth and
Rome. Alexandria, Antioch and Rome held primacy of these mother churches
because they were capitals of three sections of the Roman Empire, combining
apostolic origin with political weight. Bishop of Antioch: region of Syria.
Bishop of Alexandria: Egypt. Bishop of Rome: central and lower Italy and
indefinite boundaries. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i><u>The rise of the Roman bishop to position of Pope: </u></i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The claim of the Roman church: Peter by appointment of
the Lord had not only a simple primacy, but a personal excellence, honor and
dignity which must be given him. Peter had also a supremacy of jurisdiction
over the other apostles. This is refuted by Galatians 2:11 where Paul opposed
Peter to his face. </p>

<p class=Verses>&quot;But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his
face, because he stood condemned.&quot;  (Galatians 2:11, NASB)</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>The primacy and supremacy of
Peter are not only personal, but official, hereditary and transferable. The
transfer of the primacy and supremacy excluded the bishop of Antioch and the
bishop of Alexandria and was given to the bishop of Rome. Peter acted as bishop
of Rome until his martyrdom, appointed a successor, passing on all his primacy,
supremacy and personal dignity. There is not one shred of historical evidence
for this point. The bishops of Rome, as Peter’s successors, always enjoy total
universal jurisdiction over the entire Christian church. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'><i><u>Conditions favorable to the
ascendancy of the Roman see (causes for the growth of the Papacy):</u></i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'> The Roman church was the only
proper apostolic mother church in the west.  It was revered from the first by
the churches of Gaul, Spain and Italy. The martyrdoms and labors and burial at
Rome of Peter and Paul gave an ardor to the whole church there. There was there
a seeming halo of glory coming from the graves of the victims of persecution,
figuratively speaking. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>Rome had the political
preeminence in the world. The executive wisdom of the Roman church made itself
felt in three controversies on the time of Easter, the penitential discipline
and validity of heretical baptism. The Roman church had great firmness under
persecution. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>The Roman church had great
benevolent care of the suffering. The city of Rome itself was a factor. It was
the battlefield of orthodoxy and heresy. It was a resort for all sects and
parties. It attracted true and false philosophy and religion. Ignatius rejoiced
over being able to suffer in the center of the world. Justin Martyr presented
there in Rome his defense of Christianity to the emperors. Ireneus, Tertullian,
and Cyprian stated that this Roman church had a very great position of singular
preeminence. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'><u>The bishops and their
contributions: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>Clement of Rome: His writing to
the Corinthian church in distress indicated that the hierarchal spirit
originated more from the congregation rather than from the bishop himself, at
least in its origin. A century later this was reversed. This was indicated by
the Roman Vicar or Bishop excommunicating several churches in Asia in his own
name. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>Ignatius: Writing to the Romans
he commended the congregation for its benevolence and position. They sent
contributions to churches in other cities. This commendation went to the church
and not to the bishop. Here again the church is noted rather than the bishop in
its expression.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>Ireneus: Philip Schaff quoted,
“He calls the Roman church the greatest, oldest church, acknowledged by all,
founded by the two most illustrious apostles, Peter and Paul, the church, with
which, on account of her more important precedence, all Christendom must agree,
or to which all other churches must resort.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>Hippolytus (third century): From
his writings, we learn that the Roman bishops were already claiming an absolute
power within his own jurisdiction. Also, that a bishop can never be deposed by
a presbytery. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>Tertullian: He first lauded Rome
with special prominence where Peter was crucified, Paul beheaded and John
immersed unhurt in boiling oil and later banished. Later he became an opponent
with Rome and called the Roman Bishop in irony and mockery, “pontifex maximus.”
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>Cyprian: He gave the best account
and clearest presentation of what the episcopacy should be. His development
would be as follows: The church will be built on Peter, having been stated by
the Lord. Peter passed on the episcopacy to the bishop of Rome. The Roman
church is the seat or chair of Peter’s bishopric and the fountain of the
priesthood. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>Firmilian: Cappadocian bishop, a
disciple of Origen, took a firm stand against the bishop of Rome, indicating he
did not fully concede the primacy to the bishop of Rome as the British churches
neither would do. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'><u>The chronology of the Popes: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'><i><u>The question concerning
Peter and the Roman Papacy: </u></i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>Tertullian makes Clement as the
first successor of Peter in Rome. This would imply that Peter, of course, being
the first, was the original. Ireneus, Eusebius, Jerome and the Roman Catalogue,
put Clement in third place and put Linus between Peter and Clement. (Confusion
among the ranks.) </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>The earliest church fathers do
not put Peter among the bishops of Rome at all. The Roman Catalogue in putting
Peter in the list of Roman bishops leaves Paul cut altogether. Lipsius
classifies after diligent study that Linus, Anacletus, and Clement were presbyters
at the close of the first century. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'><i><u>The chronological list of

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b><u>Persecution in the Church or of the Church: </u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Causes of the
persecution: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Political</i>. As the church was connected or regarded
an element of Judaism, it suffered little persecution. Separate from Judaism,
Christianity was classed as a secret society and became an illegal religion.
Christians would not worship the emperor as well as Christ. This caused a
feeling of suspicion, and disloyalty regarding Christian position. Christians
held meetings at night and in secret. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Religious</i>. Roman religion was mechanical: idols,
images, priests, etc. Christianity was spiritual: no idols, eyes closed for
prayer. Public rumor made them guilty of incest, cannibalism and unnatural
practices.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Social</i>. Christianity appealed to lower classes and
was hated by the influential class. Christians held equality of all men.
Christians separated themselves from temples, theaters and pagan recreation.
Purity of Christians was silent rebuke to scandalous lives. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i>Economic</i>. Christianity was a danger to many
crafts, idol makers, soothsayers, painters, architects. Plague, famine, civic
unrest of 250 AD was ascribed to Christianity as being an evil which appeared
at the end of a millennium, of which they were superstitious. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'><u>Specific persecutions of the
church: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>Persecutions up to the date 250
AD were generally local and sporadic. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>Nero: 54-68 AD. He was the first
Roman emperor to persecute the Christian church. Blamed fire of Rome on
Christians and sought to persecute them for it. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>Domition: 90 AD. He imposed tax
on the Jews to support Capitolinus Jupitor. The Jews refused. Christians
associated with the Jews, therefore, suffered the emperor’s wrath. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>First organized persecution: 112
AD. This was by Pliny the Younger of Bithynia. He asked a Christian three times
if he was a Christian. If he said “Yes,” after the third time, he was sentenced
to death. Christians were punished unless they recanted and worshipped Roman
gods. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'><i><u>Specific persecutions after
250 AD: </u></i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>The Emperor Decius: Issued an
Edict in 250 AD that demanded annual sacrifice at Roman altars to the emperor.
A Certificate of Libellus was given to those who would make the sacrifice and
free them from persecution. This lasted one year. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>Diocletian: 285 AD ended the
Principate which was equal rule by the senate and the emperor. Issued the Edict
of 303 AD. Ordered cessation of meetings of Christians. Ordered destruction of
the churches. Ordered deposing of officials of the churches. Ordered
imprisonment because of the persisting testimony of Christians. Ordered
destruction of the Scriptures by fire. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>Traditores: These were the ones
who had given up portions of the Scripture to be burned. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>Later Edict: Christians had to
sacrifice to pagan gods or face death upon refusal.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>Methods of persecution included
loss of property, exile, imprisonment, execution by sword or beast, and labor
camps. This slackened in 305 AD upon abdication and retirement of Diocletian.
It lasted about two years. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>Galerius: 311 AD. He gave
toleration to Christianity, provided that the Christians did not violate the
peace of the empire. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>Constantine: 313 AD. Issued the
Edict of Milan which brought freedom of worship not only to Christianity, but
to all religions. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'><u>Results of the persecutions of
the church: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>The spread of Christianity to
Latin and western sections of Europe. The church in Alexandria became the chief
church in Europe. Five to twelve percent of the population of the empire was
Christian. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>Under Theodicius in 380 AD,
Christianity was decreed a state religion. Later, in 395 AD, Christianity
became the official religion. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='text-indent:0in'>Another result of persecution was
the controversies it brought. It forced the problem of the Canon. Established
the canonizing of the New Testament Scriptures. Raised the problem on the
treatment of the Christians who had offered sacrifices to pagan gods in Decian
persecution. Raised the problem on the treatment of the Christians who had
given up the Scriptures to be burned under the Diocletian persecution.</p>
