the present New Testament would be canonized.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Council of Hippo: 419 AD. Verified the decree of the
Council of Carthage.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Three Stages of Development of the Canon</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Writings of the New Testament books were quoted by
authors who took the inherent force of the books for granted, not making them a
point of debate.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Writers engaged in controversy over the books, seeking to
define their authorities.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Church councils met to render their verdict of official
recognition of canonicity or recognition of apocryphal works.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Solidifying of the Church </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Note that there is a real vacuum in teaching upon the
distinction between the Body of Christ and the local church concept. These two
were wedded into one and greatly perverted.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The three major factors in the solidifying of the
church: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The development of the Canon of the New Testament. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The creation of the Authoritative Statement of Faith. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The obedience under and to the Monarchal Bishop.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Monarchal Bishop: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This man would become the bond for the church. Steps of
development: </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Exalted position of the bishop: Ignatius was primarily
the first supporter. This came out of a need for leadership. This came out of a
need for unity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The development of the Doctrine of Apostolic Succession.
Iraneaus: Book Three.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The exaltation of the Lord’s Supper. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The special honor attributed to the bishop at Rome. This
is due to the Petrine Doctrine placing the primacy of Peter with the Roman
Bishopric. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Doctrine of Apostolic Succession: The successors of
Peter function at Rome. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Apostolic Tradition: Martyrdom of Paul and Peter. The
Roman church became the wealthiest church of the area. Rome was the capital
city. Rome was the center of missionary activity. Other bishops began to
decline in prominence.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Creation of Authoritative Statements of Faith (by
the end of the second century, 300 AD). </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Creeds were written. A creed is a statement of faith for
public use. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Creeds functioned for several purposes: To test
orthodoxy. To recognize fellow believers by lining them up with the creed. They
were summaries of essential doctrines. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Apostles’ Creed: the oldest statement of faith.
Emphasized the Trinity. Emphasized the universal church. Emphasized
eschatology.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>The Development of the Canon of the New Testament: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The gathering of the Scriptures for compilation into a
canon was completed by about 175 AD. But, as a unit of compilation, it wasn’t
completed until 180 AD. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i><u>The tests for canonicity: </u></i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This section is classified by the term “Apostolicity.”
The first test for canonicity was Apostolicity. This will be further developed
under two more concepts; first, apostolic authorship, secondly, apostolic
authority.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They had to be recognized as inspired Scripture (which
they were) by: </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Paul acknowledged Luke’s Gospel as Scripture: 1 Tim.
5:18. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Peter acknowledges Paul’s writing as Scripture: 2 Peter
3:15,16. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Clement of Rome, 96 AD, recognizes 1 Cor., Matt., Luke
and quotes from Romans, 1 Cor., Eph., 1 Tim., Titus, Hebrews and 1 John.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Epistles of Barnabas quote Matthew as Scripture in
the period of 70-79 AD. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Didache, Teaching of the Twelve, assume the authority
and inspiration of Matthew and Luke, and contains 23 borrowings from the New
Testament. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Polycarp: quotes from the New Testament from Matt., Luke,
John, Acts and ten of Paul’s Epistles. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the “Second Epistle of Clement” 120-140 AD, there are
two quotes from Matthew.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Justin Martyr: uses many books of the New Testament as
Scripture, Matt., Luke, John, Mark, six of Paul’s Epistles, 1 John and
Revelation. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Irenaeus: 125-192 AD, made 1800 quotations of the New
Testament using it as Scripture. He recognized four Gospels, and only four.
Besides the Gospels he uses Acts, 13 of Paul’s Epistles, 1 Peter, 1 John, and
Revelation. He considered them equal to the Old Testament in being inspired,
canonical and authoritative. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Clement of Alexandra: 150-217 AD (scholar, bishop,
teacher, writer). Acknowledged as canonical: four Gospels, Acts, Paul’s
Epistles, 1 Peter, 1 John, Hebrews, James, Jude, and Revelation. He called the
New Testament the “divine Scriptures, the holy books.”</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Tertullian: North African Teacher. Quotes 1800 different
passages from the New Testament. Makes 7220 references to it. Makes 200
references to the book of John. Makes 3800 references to the Gospels. Used 22
or 23 New Testament books as inspired.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They had to have apostolic authorship. This means written
by an apostle directly. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They had to have apostolic authority. This meant they had
to be written by companions of the apostles, who came from the apostolic
circles and taught the apostolic doctrines. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They had to be books read in all the churches. This was
held as one of the very important factors in the test for canonicity, not read
in just some churches, but all of them. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They had to be recognized by the church fathers. This has
been demonstrated under the section above regarding “They had to be recognized
as inspired Scripture.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The books had to answer to the question: Does it agree
with the doctrine, or rule of faith? Today, it is the opposite. Does the
doctrine agree with the Scriptures? </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The books had to edify. This was only minor, but included
in the test. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The perfect assurance of the inward testimony of the
Spirit. This is an early recognition that the Holy Spirit does not allow any
error or false doctrine to enter into the realm of the human spirit. They
counted heavily on this factor in determining the canonicity of a book.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The Development of the Liturgy of the Church:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i><u>The acts of worship became tools to present the
superiority of the bishop. </u></i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Baptism and the Lord’s Supper reached the point where
only the bishops could do it, or an accredited minister. This gave a “holiness”
connotation to the office of bishop. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Baptism became an act of initiation into the Christian
church and usually took place on Easter or Pentecost. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>In the first century only faith in Christ and a desire to
be baptized were necessary for baptism. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>By the end of the second century there was a probationary
period of training before baptism could take place. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>During the probationary period the candidate for baptism
was not allowed to worship in the sanctuary, called the “nave.” </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Infant baptism, baptizing babies, and clinical baptism
(baptizing of the sick) came into practice. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Next to develop, was the cycle of feasts during the year.
Easter came in as a counterpart to the Jewish Passover, Christmas came later in
350 AD and was cleansed of its pagan significance by then. Lent had been
accepted as a part of the church year before Christmas was accepted. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i><u>Places of worship: </u></i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Before 313 AD, Christians met in the catacombs of Rome
and in cemeteries. They were 20 to 50 feet below the ground and were a series
of passageways.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Later they built buildings on the style of the Roman
Basilica, an oblong building. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><i><u>The church structures and furniture: </u></i></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>An oblong building with a porch on the west where those
under the probation worshipped. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Inside at the east end was a semicircle effect where the
altar and seat of the bishop was located. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Inside also was the sanctuary or auditorium with seating
and aisles on the sides. These buildings were very simple until after 313 AD
when they began to become more fancy.</p>
