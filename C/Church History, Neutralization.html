<h2><a name="_Church_History,_Neutralization"></a>Church History, Neutralization
of the Church: 375-590 AD</h2>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Neutralization of the church because of immaturity in
production: </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The two-fold problem in the empire. The decline of the
Roman Empire placed upon the church the task of conserving Helleno-Hebraic
culture. The task of giving the Gospel to the barbarians created an internal
problem. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The results of these two problems in the church: The
voice of the State became heard in the affairs of the church. A secularization
took place in the church through the assimilation of the pagans into the
assemblies.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>A backward look at the buildup of the Church and state
relations: </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Anarchy ruled with all doing that which was right in
their own eyes: 133-31 BC </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Octavian and Mark Antony fight the battle of Axion: 31 BC
</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Octavian sets up a diarchy, two ruling head government:
31 BC - 192 AD </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Revolution took place (192-284 AD) with Diocletian coming
on the scene. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Strong emperors beginning with Diocletian: 285-305 AD </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Diocletian: 285-205 AD </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Constantine: in 311 AD moving toward Rome, saw a flaming
cross. Defeated enemies at Milvian Bridge over the Tiber River. The battle was
a result of a revolt in the west. Observation: The gravity or the Imperial
Power was beginning to move to the East and the gravity of the Church powers was
moving to the West.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>State interferes in church affairs under Constantine. Restored
the church property. Subsidized the church financially. Exempted the clergy
from public office. Banned soothsaying. Officially set aside Sunday (“Day of
the Sun”) for the empire as the rest of worship. Intervened at the Council of
Nicea. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Julian: set the church back. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Gratian: renounced the title, Pontifex Maximum, the title
of the High Priest of the pagan emperor worship. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Theodocius: made Christianity the exclusive religion of
the empire in 380 AD. Christianity recognized as the official and only religion
of the Roman State in 395 AD. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Justinian: closed the school of philosophy in Athens and
this was the final stroke at Paganism. Observation: The Pope in the West was
stronger than the Emperor and the Patriarch in the East was weaker than the
Emperor.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The advantages of the church at this time of church
and state relations: </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Increased the dignity of women. Stopped gladiatorial
shows. Slaves received better treatment. Roman legislation was more just. Missionary
work was speeded up.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The disadvantages of the Church at this time of church
and state relations: </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>There was governmental interference in the Church. The Church
became the persecutor rather than the persecuted. It weakened the spiritual
impact of the Church.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Observation: This basically gives the picture of the
first of the two problems, the voice of the state in the affairs of the Church.
This brings us to the problem of secularization and this is attributed to the
great influx of pagans into the empire.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The neutralization of the Church through the entrance
of barbarians into the empire: </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Visigoths: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Asked permission to enter the empire as the Mongols were
attacking them. Visigoths defeat the eastern empire in 378 AD at the Battle of
Adrianople. Visigoths sacked Rome in 410 AD. Visigoths founded the kingdom of
Spain in 426 AD. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Vandals: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>They had preceded the Visigoths to Spain. They were
driven out by the Visigoths. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Lombards,
Burgundians, and Franks:  </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Crossed the Rhine and settled in the fifth century in
modern France. The Mohammedians were militant and on the move at this time, 622
AD.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The evangelization of the barbarians:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Missionary to
the Goths: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Ulfilas, 311-381 AD before the spread of barbarians. Was
an Arian Christian. Reduced the language of the Goths to writing. Created an
alphabet and gave them Scriptures in their own language. He left out Kings and
Samuel because the Goths were warlike people. Many Visigoths became believers
after they conquered the Goths. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Arianism: Arias claimed Christ had not existed from all
eternity, but was created in past eternity and not of the same substance as the
Father. Christ was not co-equal, co-eternal, and co-substantial with the Father
Christ was divine but not deity.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Missionary to
the Burgundians: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Martin of Tours, 311-396 AD was the patron saint of
France. He organized his soldier monks into bands. He set out to destroy the
groves where the pagan gods were worshipped. When Clovis, King of the Franks,
became a Christian the mass of the people also accepted Christianity. Whether
real or not, this was going to be a big factor in the life of the church
hereafter. Frankish kings crossed the Alps many times to save a Roman bishop in
distress</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Missionaries
to the British Isles: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Probably Roman soldiers and merchants. There were Celtic
bishops at the Council of Arles in 314 AD. The British Celtic Church had
certain interesting characteristics: The church had the opponent to Augustine
there, by the name of Pelagius.  Pelagius taught a heresy known by his name in
429 AD. It denied original sin and said that man has a complete free will
unhindered by the old sin nature. The British church did not recognize the
jurisdiction nor the primacy of the Roman bishop. When the Roman troops left,
the British Celtic church was defenseless and was driven into the hills by the
Angles, Saxons, and Jutes. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Missionary to
the Celts of Ireland: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Patrick, 432-461 AD had opposition from the priests of
the Druid religion but succeeded in establishing a strong Christian faith in
Ireland. Later in the Dark Ages, Ireland was a center of culture out of which
came missionaries and scholars. One man was Columba, who went to Scotland. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><u>Missionary to
Scotland: </u></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Columba, 521-597 AD. In 563 AD, he founded a monastery on
Iona, an island, which became the center for evangelization of Scotland. Both
the Scotland Church and the Celtic British Church were definitely missionary
churches. Celtic Christianity in Ireland and Scotland had become strong, while
British Celtic Christianity had all but died out.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>The neutralization of the church definitely felt in
its worship and practice: </b></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The church by 590 AD had passed on to the barbarian
invaders the Greco-Roman culture. The church had assimilated many of these
pagans into their churches. This assimilation resulted in many things still
existing in the churches: Saint worship was substituted for hero worship. Many
rituals and practices were incorporated.</p>
